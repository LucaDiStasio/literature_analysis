The broad classes of glass-fiber-reinforced systems that were examined include 2D plain-woven laminates, 3D orthogonally woven monolithic systems, and 3D orthogonally woven laminates. The experimental results indicate that the 3D laminates consistently had greater damage tolerance than the 2D laminates and the 3D monolithic composites. The enhanced damage tolerance of the 3D systems is due to unique energy absorption mechanisms, which involve the crimped portion of z-tows.",

The proposed damage model is based on damage mechanisms observed at the ply level and hypotheses regarding their effect on material stiffness. Focusing on matrix dominated failure modes, the damage behavior is split into two contributions, damage evolution and damage effect. The prior describes the progression of damage as a function of load, while the latter predicts the effect of this damage by a fourth order tensor relation as function of the current failure mode and stress state. The model relies on six material parameters, whose identification by standard tests is addressed. By combining the damage model with classical lamination theory, the behavior of laminates under plane stress loading is predicted. The capabilities of the proposed damage model are assessed based on comparison to experimental data from the literature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Despite the recent success of modeling progressive damage of open-hole fiber reinforced composites subjected to tension (OHT), it is still a challenging task to predict the strengths and the damage progression of open-hole composite laminates under compressive loading (OHC). Herein, we propose a progressive damage model for OHC based on our early model for OHT and apply it to study the size effects of OHC. In the proposed model, continuum shell elements are used to account for both in-plane and out-of-plane deformation and delamination is modeled using cohesive elements. A smeared crack model is used to model the progressive failure of composite plies. It is found that the proposed model can predict accurately the experimental strengths and damage patterns with the assumption that the translaminar fracture toughness for blocked plies increases. The different failure mechanisms of the sublaminate scaled laminates of the stacking sequence 45/90/-45/0ms and the ply-level scaled laminates of stacking sequence 45n/90n/-45n/0ns are found to be closely related to the in-plane shear stress of the central 0° ply block and the initiation of interface delamination.",

Fiber breakage, delaminations, matrix cracking, plastic deformations due to contact and large displacements are some effects which should be considered when a structure made from composite material is impacted by a foreign object. Thus, an investigation of the low velocity impact on laminated composite thin disks of epoxy resin reinforced by carbon fiber is presented. The influence of stacking sequence and energy impact was investigated using load-time histories, displacement-time histories and energy-time histories as well as images from NDE. Indentation tests results were compared to dynamic results, verifying the inertia effects when thin composite laminate was impacted by foreign object with low velocity. Finite element analysis (FEA) was developed, using Hill&#039;s model and material models implemented by UMAT (User Material Subroutine) into software ABAQUS???, in order to simulate the failure mechanisms under indentation tests. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Three E-glass fabrics, non-crimp fabric, woven fabric, and nonwoven mat, were selected as reinforcements for the composite laminates. Impact tests were conducted using a guided drop-weight test rig in ascending energy to 24 J/layer nominal impact energy. Metallographic microscopy was used to observe the damage characteristics of the perpendicular cross-section of the impacted laminates after a micropowder polishing treatment. When the load–time and the energy–time histories were compared with the fractographics, it was found that fiber breakage had occurred prior to the major damage. When the impact energy increased over the threshold energy of the major damage, matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber breakage were observed at the back surface, below a nearly undamaged zone, which were attributed to the bending stresses.",

In-plane compression tests at strain rates around 400/s quasi-isotropic laminates were performed using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). The material system used was Texipreg® HS160 REM, comprising high strength unidirectional carbon fiber and epoxy resin. The dynamic strength of quasi-isotropic laminates exhibits a considerable increase when compared to the static values. The finite-element model used ABAQUS™ three-dimensional solid elements C3D8I with 8 nodes and user-defined interface finite elements with 8 nodes [Gonçalves JPM, de Moura MFSF, de Castro PMST, Marques AT. Interface element including point-to-surface constraints for three-dimensional problems with damage propagation. Eng Comp: Int J Comput Aided Eng Software 2000;17(1):28-47; de Moura MFSF, Pereira AB, de Morais AB. Influence of intralaminar cracking on the apparent interlaminar mode I fracture toughness of cross-ply laminates. Fatigue Fract Eng Mater Struct 2004;27(9):759-66.]. These interface elements which connect the three-dimensional solid elements modeling the composite layers, include a cohesive damage model allowing the simulation of delamination initiation and propagation. Hence the present model assumes that the phenomenon of failure under these conditions is mainly dictated by interface delamination. This is supported by experimental tests which showed that all quasi-isotropic laminates split into several almost intact sublaminates. The model compares very well with experimental results, confirming the formulated hypothesis that the internal layer damage does not markedly contribute to the quasi-isotropic laminate failure. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The damage model is implemented in an implicit finite element code taking into account the requirement to ensure a mesh-independent computation of the dissipated energy. The comparison between the model predictions and published experimental data indicates that the model can accurately predict the effects of transverse matrix cracks on the residual stiffness of quasi-isotropic laminates, the interaction between transverse matrix cracks and delamination, and final failure of the laminate.",

Experiments were performed to investigate the variations of cutting forces with or without onset of delamination during the drilling operations. The effects of tool geometry and drilling parameters on cutting force variations in CFRP composite materials drilling were also experimentally examined. The experimental results show that the delamination-free drilling processes may be obtained by the proper selections of tool geometry and drilling parameters. The effects of drilling parameters and tool wear on delamination factor are also presented and discussed. Cutting temperature has long been recognized as an important factor influencing the tool wear rate and tool life. An experimental investigation of flank surface temperatures is also presented in this paper. Experimental results indicated that the flank surface temperatures increase with increasing cutting speed but decreasing feed rate. Optimal cutting conditions are proposed to avoid damage from burning during the drilling processes.",

The experimental results indicate that the 3D laminates consistently had greater damage tolerance than the 2D laminates and the 3D monolithic composites. The enhanced damage tolerance of the 3D systems is due to unique energy absorption mechanisms, which involve the crimped portion of z-tows.",

          "abstract": "The so-called &quot;damage mesomodel for laminates&quot; developed in the past fifteen years, particularly at Cachan, is being reconsidered in the light of the recent works, theoretical as well as experimental, done on the microscale. Previous works have already proved that this mesomodel can be interpreted as the homogenized result of micromodels involving common microdamage mechanisms: transverse microcracking, delamination at the tips of transverse microcracks and fiber-matrix debonding. Here, we are going one step further by considering microcracking in skin plies of various thicknesses. To fit experimental results better, we introduced a modification of the coupling of the three microdamage scenarios in all plies. Contrary to the classical approach, the critical values of the energy release rate are not associated with a healthy material but with a damaged material; the first damage mechanism to occur is associated with non-transverse microcracks due to nearly uniformly distributed fiber-matrix debonding in the damaged ply. These mechanisms and this coupling are homogenized on the mesoscale, which leads to an improved version of the &quot;damage mesomodel for laminates&quot; involving only a small number of material constants which can be interpreted on the microscale. Thickness effects are taken into account: the improved version, unlike the previous one, is valid for arbitrary values of the thickness. We discuss experimental data and identification using carbon-epoxy laminates at room temperature. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The composite systems included a 2D plain-woven laminate, a 3D orthogonally woven monolith, and a biaxially reinforced warp-knit. The radial spread of damage was smallest for the 2D laminates and largest for the 3D woven composites. The 3D composites had the greatest resistance to penetration and dissipated more total energy than the other systems. This is due to unique energy absorption mechanisms, which involve the crimped portion of z-tows in the 3D composites, and implies that failure can be controlled by manipulation of the properties of the z-tows. The 3D systems provide both an inherent capability to dissipate energy over a larger area and a greater perforation strength than other systems with comparable areal densities and fiber-volume-fractions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Delaminations are modeled using a cohesive type tie-break interface introduced between sublaminates while intralaminar damage mechanisms within the sublaminates are captured in a smeared manner using a strain-softening plastic-damage model. In the latter case, a nonlocal regularization scheme is used to address the spurious mesh dependency and mesh-orientation problems that occur with all local strain-softening type constitutive models. The results for the predicted damage patterns using the nonlocal approach are encouraging and qualita- tively agree with the experimental observations. The predictive performance of the pro- posed numerical model is assessed through comparisons with available instrumented impact test results on a class of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates. Force-time histories and other derived cross-plots such as the force versus projectile displacement and progression of projectile energy loss as a function of time are compared with available experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the model in capturing the details of the dynamic response. Another case study involving the blast loading of CFRP composite laminates is used to further highlight the capability of the proposed model in simulating the global structural response of composite laminates subjected to distributed pressure pulses.",

The laminates were manufactured using a fast one-step cold press manufacturing procedure. The mechanical behavior of the laminates was then investigated under tensile and fatigue loading conditions. The tensile properties of the plain aluminum, the composite materials and the thermoplastic fiber-metal laminates were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. The fatigue tests were also conducted under load control in accordance with the ASTM E466 standard procedure. Various loading cycles were employed for the fatigue tests in order to minimize the possibility of heat generation on the composite materials. Load levels of 40, 60 and 80% of yield strength of each thermoplastic fiber-metal laminate panel were applied with zero to max loading. The glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene hybrid systems exhibited higher fatigue strength than the self-reinforced polypropylene-based fiber-metal laminates. Then, punch-stretch forming tests were performed in order to evaluate the formability of the hybrid systems. Experimental results revealed that the self-reinforced thermoplastic composite-based fiber-metal laminate exhibit excellent forming properties similar to that of the monolithic aluminum alloy of comparable thickness. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The reduction to the compression modulus, strength and fatigue performance of carbon/epoxy laminates with increasing volume content and diameter of pins is determined. The elastic modulus decreases at a quasi-linear rate with increasing pin content and pin diameter. Softening is caused by fiber waviness around the pins and reduced fiber volume content due to volumetric swelling of the laminate from the pins. A simple model is presented for calculating the compression modulus of pinned laminates that considers the softening effects of fiber waviness and fiber dilution. The compression strength and fatigue life also decrease with increasing volume content and diameter of the pins. The strength and fatigue properties are reduced by fiber kinking caused by fiber waviness around the pins and the reduced fiber content caused by swelling. The deterioration to the compression properties is also dependent on the fiber lay-up pattern of the laminate, with the magnitude of the loss in properties increasing with the percentage of 0° (load bearing) fibers in the laminate.

Several empirical models have been conceived to account for this discrepancy, as well as the effect of block sequence. The approach taken here is based on the underlying mechanisms. A cross-ply laminate was used as a model material. In general, composites show both initiatory and progressive mechanisms under fatigue loading. The former is active at high static stresses, whereas the latter predominates at lower stress amplitudes where they are given sufficient time to propagate. Initiatory mechanisms give rise to damage from which the progressive mechanisms can start, and conversely the progressive mechanisms continually alter the local stress state which results in further damage accumulation caused by the initiation controlled mechanisms. In a cross-ply laminate, the initiatory mechanism is the formation of transverse cracks, and the progressive mechanism is mainly delamination growth initiated from the transverse cracks. In an experimental investigation of carbon fiber/epoxy cross-ply laminates, the interaction of these mechanisms has shown why a sequence of high-low amplitude levels results in shorter lifetimes than a low-high order. Such a sequence effect seems to be a common behavior for many other composite materials, and can be mechanistically explained by a similar kind of interaction.

The numerical model includes lamina and interface elements. The description of the delamination crack growth rate is based on the cyclic degradation of bilinear interface elements linking the evolution of the damage variable with the delamination crack growth rate. The constitutive cyclic damage model is calibrated by means of mixed mode fatigue experiments and reproduces the experimental results successfully and with minor error. It is concluded that only with implementing a cyclic damage variable in the cohesive interface element the experimentally observed crack growth and stiffness degradation can be captured properly. Scanning electron microscopy of fracture surfaces after cyclic loading revealed that abrasion of crack bridging surface roughness is the main microscopical cause of weakening and degradation of the interface. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The first severe failure induced by the low-velocity drop-weight impact occurred as delamination between the aluminum and fiber-epoxy layers at the non-impact side. It was followed by a visible shear crack in the outer aluminum layer on the non-impact face. Through-thickness shear cracks in the aluminum sheets and severe damage in the fiber laminated layers (including delamination between adjacent fiber-epoxy laminae with different fiber orientations) developed under higher energy impacts. The impact properties of fiber-metal laminates varied with different constituent materials and fiber orientations. Since it was punched through easily, the aramid-fiber reinforced fiber-metal laminates (ARALL) offered poorer impact resistance than the glass-fiber reinforced fiber-metal laminates (GLARE). Tougher and more ductile aluminum alloys improved the impact resistance. GLARE made of cross-ply prepregs provided better impact resistance than GLARE with unidirectional plies.",

The chapter explains the schematic diagrams showing the loading directions, layer and laminate dimensions, and stacking sequence of the laminates. The six laminates chosen for analysis by the participants are considered to be the representative of a wide range of composite laminates encountered in practical use in a variety of industries. The materials selected have been widely used in practical applications and their properties are well characterized. The chapter presents nonlinear stress-strain data and elastic constants for linear elastic analysis and discusses a wide range of practical biaxial loading conditions, which produce a variety of modes of failure. In some cases, a succession of failures may occur before the laminate can no longer carry load. In some cases, the stress-strain behavior of the laminates is expected to be linear and in some other cases, highly nonlinear.",

It is essential to simulate the initial and subsequent evolution process of this kind of damage phenomenon accurately in order to explore the mechanical properties of composite laminates. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the general methodologies on the damage constitutive modeling by continuum damage mechanics (CDM), the various failure criteria, the damage evolution law simulating the stiffness degradation, and the finite element implementation of progressive failure analysis in terms of the mechanical response for the variable-stiffness composite laminates arising from the continuous failure. The damage constitutive modeling is discussed by describing the evolvement of damage tensors and conjugate forces in the CDM theory. The failure criteria which interpret the failure modes and their interaction are compared and some advanced methods such as the cohesive theory which are used to predict the damage evolution properties of composites are also discussed. In addition, the solution algorithm using finite element analysis which implements progressive failure analysis is summarized and several applicable methods which deal with the numerical convergence problem due to singular finite element stiffness matrices are also compared in order to explore the whole failure process and ultimate load-bearing ability of composite laminates. Finally, the multiscale progressive failure analysis as a popular topic which associates the macroscopic with microscopic damage and failure mechanisms is discussed and the extended finite element method as a new finite element technique is expected to accelerate its practical application to the progressive failure analysis of composite laminates. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

It explains graphs showing the theoretical predictions for failure envelopes and stress/strain diagrams of the 14 test cases. The successive failure of different laminates subjected to a variety of loading conditions is treated by a layer-by-layer failure analysis. Three sources of nonlinearity are considered-namely, material nonlinearity because of micro damage, matrix cracking, and changes in fiber angle with increasing strains. There is good agreement between predictions and experimental results. Some disagreement is because of imperfections in certain tests; therefore, these tests should be repeated. Three categories of laminate configuration/loading condition can be distinguished: (I) laminates with 3 or more fiber directions with arbitrary loading conditions; (II) balanced angle ply laminates with stress ratios in accordance with netting analysis; and (III) laminates with 2 fiber directions and loadings, which are not in accordance with netting analysis. The analysis of category (I) is straight forward. Category (II) is sensitive to the stiffness degradation after the onset of matrix cracking. Category (III) fails at low stresses and large strains of the laminate, because of a rapid deterioration. To define a failure limit for category (III), an intensive discussion is necessary. For the detection of the different modes (A, B, C) of inter-fiber fracture (IFF), refined action plane related IFF-criteria developed by Puck on the basis of Mohr&#039;s and Hashin&#039;s considerations on brittle fracture are explained.",

Energies absorbed at different levels of damage are obtained from the load-unload curves. Two different support spans of 25.4 mm (1 in.) and 101.6 mm (4 in.) diameter with different layers (1, 2, 4, 6, 11, and 22 with 0.6 mm ply thickness) of composite laminates are tested under quasi-static loading to identify compression-shear and tension-shear dominated modes of damage. After each test, the damaged plates are sectioned to visualize the extent of delamination and material damage. Numerical punch-shear experiments are conducted using LS-DYNA 970. The numerical modeling is carried out using a newly developed composite damage model, namely MAT 162, which has been incorporated into LS-DYNA. MAT 162 uses damage mechanics principle for progressive damage and material degradation. Input data required in MAT 162 have been calibrated to match the experimental results of 22-layer composite plate of both spans (25.4 and 101.6 mm). The calibrated material properties have been used to simulate other thicknesses, and the simulated results show good agreement with experiment results.

          "abstract": "In this paper, the damage progression and failure characteristics of stitched composites under out-of-plane loading are experimentally investigated. Test specimens, stitched with various stitch densities and stitch thread thicknesses, are studied using quasi-static indentation test. Test specimens are loaded and unloaded in 0.5. mm incremental indentation displacement to examine for damage phenomena using non-destructive inspection techniques namely ultrasonic C-scan, X-ray radiography and X-ray micro-computed tomography to elucidate complex damage mechanisms and fracture behavior. Recorded test history of load-displacement curves indicate that damage progression can be characterized into three stages: damage initiation, damage propagation and final damage failure. Results show that damage initiation occurs at a lower load in stitched composites due to the presence of resin-rich regions which act as crack initiation sites. X-ray radiography convincingly shows that stitch-induced matrix crack lines are joined between stitch loops, being particularly evident in densely stitched composites. During damage propagation, stitching becomes highly effective in suppressing delamination growth, resulting in stitched laminates having much smaller delamination area compared to unstitched laminates, and the rate of delamination growth being inversely related to stitch density. It is found out that final failure is distinguished by a sharp load drop in the load-displacement curve. It is revealed that the final failure load increases with increasing stitch fiber volume fraction. The final failure mechanism in unstitched and moderately stitched composite is mainly delamination failure; while densely stitched composite failed by indenter penetration comprising of in-plane fiber fracture and matrix crushing. Energy absorption throughout the quasi-static indentation process is presented and discussed. This work provides novel insight to the damage progression and damage penetration of stitched composites. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Under complex environments such as continuous or cyclic loads, the stiffness degradation for the laminated composites such as the carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites is an important physical and mechanical response to the damage and failure evolution. It is essential to simulate the initial and subsequent evolution process of this kind of damage phenomenon accurately in order to explore the mechanical properties of composite laminates. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the general methodologies on the damage constitutive modeling by continuum damage mechanics (CDM), the various failure criteria, the damage evolution law simulating the stiffness degradation, and the finite element implementation of progressive failure analysis in terms of the mechanical response for the variable-stiffness composite laminates arising from the continuous failure. The damage constitutive modeling is discussed by describing the evolvement of damage tensors and conjugate forces in the CDM theory. The failure criteria which interpret the failure modes and their interaction are compared and some advanced methods such as the cohesive theory which are used to predict the damage evolution properties of composites are also discussed. In addition, the solution algorithm using finite element analysis which implements progressive failure analysis is summarized and several applicable methods which deal with the numerical convergence problem due to singular finite element stiffness matrices are also compared in order to explore the whole failure process and ultimate load-bearing ability of composite laminates. Finally, the multiscale progressive failure analysis as a popular topic which associates the macroscopic with microscopic damage and failure mechanisms is discussed and the extended finite element method as a new finite element technique is expected to accelerate its practical application to the progressive failure analysis of composite laminates.",

          "abstract": "In cyclically loaded polymer matrix composites, structural health monitoring is useful for detecting and tracking progressive damage. Existing approaches use stiffness degradation, crack propagation/strain energy change, or dynamic parameters such as frequency response. These approaches, however, depend on prior assumptions of the dominant damage mechanisms. In this study, a new hysteresis-based damage parameter, D&#039;, that is a measure of damage progression and failure is shown to be more sensitive than stiffness degradation and can be determined during cycling without the use of additional instrumentation. D&#039; was measured for cyclically loaded notched glass fiber laminates and was found to be useful as a measure of damage progression. Cyclic hysteresis strain energy dissipated at each cycle was monitored continuously without interruption. A conventional servo-hydraulic fatigue testing system was modified with the incorporation of new custom code for performing command and data acquisition on a cycle-by-cycle basis. In this fashion, progressive damage at each cycle was determined quantitatively in real time during each test. Hysteresis data were obtained from fatigue tests conducted on notched [0/90] E-glass/epoxy laminates in real time on a cycle-by-cycle basis and used to estimate failure. The damage parameter D&#039; exhibited an approximately linear increase with cycling followed by an exponential increase just before failure. Modeling this behavior allowed for the prediction of damage progression and residual life as a function of load cycles. Hysteresis-based damage parameters for other material configurations were also calculated and found to give good estimates for the cyclic life. © 2010 The Author(s).",

Acoustic emission (AE) technique was utilized in tracking the damage accumulation profile during loading up to fracture in terms of AE counts rate and cumulative. In addition wavelet transforms was used to process AE signals in order to obtain both frequencies and time information on the main failure mechanism and the sequential events during fracture process. This was supported by light and electron microscopies characterizations. The mechanical and acoustical responses were examined with respect to orientation and temperature effects for the Glare 2, exposure temperature effect for the Gr/Ep and porosity degree effect for the C/C. Manifestly, the AE results demonstrate different damage build-up profiles and point to a transition in failure micro-mechanisms with respect to the influence of each parameter (temperature, orientation, and density) on the specific composite tested. For the Gr/Ep, the wavelet transforms indicate the sequence of events in the fracture process, from fiber breaks followed by debonding and ending with matrix cracking. In some cases, it has been observed that the damage accumulation profile in terms of AE resembled the dependency of the crack density versus the strain predicted by a micro-mechanical damage model. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Usually, mechanical drilling operation is an important final machining process for components made of composite laminates. However, composite laminates are regarded as hard-to-machine materials, which results in low drilling efficiency and undesirable drilling-induced delamination. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the cost-effectiveness of currently-available drilling processes and to develop more advanced drilling processes for composite laminates. Such improvement and development will benefit from a comprehensive literature review on drilling of composite laminates. This review paper summarizes an up-to-date progress in mechanical drilling of composite laminates reported in the literature. It covers drilling operations (including conventional drilling, grinding drilling, vibration-assisted twist drilling, and high speed drilling), drill bit geometry and materials, drilling-induced delamination and its suppressing approaches, thrust force, and tool wear.

This paper presents the results of an extensive experimental campaign conducted to investigate the feasibility of using vibration-based methods to identify damages sustained by composite laminates due to low-velocity impacts. The experimental programme included an evaluation of impact damage resistance and tolerance according to ASTM test methods, characterisation of induced damage by ultrasonic testing and quantification of the effects on the vibration response. The damage identification involved the detection, localisation, quantification and estimation of the remaining bearing capacity. Four damage indicators based on modal parameters were assessed by comparing pristine and damaged states. The results allowed for conclusions to be drawn regarding the capability and suitability of each damage indicator, including its ability to detect impact-induced damage, its precision in determining the location of damage, its sensitivity regarding damage extent and pertinent correlations with residual bearing capacity. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The specimen thickness and lay-up sequence had little effect on the through-the-thickness water absorption behavior of composite laminates, but the other parameters affected the moisture absorption rate and equilibrium water uptake in different ways and intensities. The glass transition temperature of composite laminates was strongly affected and linearly decreased by the quantity of equilibrium water uptake. A characteristic length of moisture migration through the unidirectional laminates was proposed as a function of fiber angle to the exposed laminate surface.

During static tensile testing, the response of bearing damage was monitored by acoustic emission measurement. Several specimens were observed by means of soft X-ray radiography and SEM at different loading levels to assess internal damage. The observations indicate that the bearing failure can be outlined as a process of compressive damage accumulation, and can be divided into the following four stages: Damage onset; damage growth; local fracture; structural fracture. Major features of bearing failure include fiber micro-buckling, matrix cracking, delamination and out-of-plane shear cracking.

          "abstract": "Composite panels are widely used in aeronautic and aerospace structures due to their high strength/weight ratio. The stiffness and the strength in the thickness direction of laminated composite panels is poor since no fibres are present in that direction and out-of-plane impact loading is considered potentially dangerous, mainly because the damage may be left undetected. Impact loading in composite panels leads to damage with matrix cracking, inter-laminar failure and eventually fibre breakage for higher impact energies. Even when no visible impact damage is observed at the surface on the point of impact, matrix cracking and inter-laminar failure can occur, and the carrying load of the composite laminates is considerably reduced. The greatest reduction in loading is observed in compression due to laminae buckling in the delaminated areas. The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of the damage growth of impacted composite laminates when subjected to compression after impact loading. For this purpose a series of impact and compression after impact tests were carried out on composite laminates made of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin matrix. An instrumented drop-weight-testing machine and modified compression after impact testing equipment were used together with a C-scan ultrasonic device for the damage identification. Four stacking sequences of two different epoxy resins in carbon fibres representative of four different elastic behaviours and with a different number of interfaces were used. Results showed that the delaminated area due to impact loading depends on the number of interfaces between plies. Two buckling failure mechanisms were identified during compression after impact, which are influenced more by the delamination area than by the stacking sequence.",

Three different reinforcements, woven carbon fabric, woven glass fabric and unidirectional carbon tape, are combined with an epoxy resin using the Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) process. In-plane quasi-isotropic laminates are analyzed by combining pairs of materials and by changing their location in the through-the-thickness direction of the laminate. In addition, different impact configurations defined in terms of impact energy are performed to increase the number of case studies. The analysis is completed by non-destructive inspections based on ultrasonic technique and Compression After Impact (CAI) tests for the assessment of the residual strength. The results obtained highlight the effects of interply carbon and glass hybridization under low-velocity impact and CAI loading. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the results of a series of blast tests on a carbon fiber-reinforced poly-ether-imide (PEI) and a glass fiber-reinforced PEI composite. Initially, the fracture properties of the two composite systems were characterized through a series of flexural and interlaminar fracture tests. Blast testing was then undertaken on a ballistic pendulum facility, capable of measuring the impulse imparted by the plastic explosive. Delamination, localized fiber buckling, fiber fracture, and shear failure at the boundary of the clamped plates were identified as the primary failure mechanisms in the laminates, with their severity depending on the panel thickness and the applied impulse. Delamination was very localized along the center plane of the laminate, a reflection of the very high interlaminar fracture toughness of these composites. The critical impulse for rear surface fiber fracture has been found to increase rapidly with laminate thickness for the range of panels considered here. The impulses associated with the onset of rear-surface fiber fracture and complete failure of the target were similar, suggesting that rear surface fiber fracture is a pre-cursor to complete failure in these laminates. Limited tests on the glass fiber-reinforced PEI system showed that it offers a superior blast resistance to its carbon fiber counterpart. © SAGE Publications 2008.",

          "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced composite laminates are often used in harsh environments that may affect their long-term durability as well as residual strength. In general, environmental degradation is observed as matrix cracking and erosion that leads to deterioration of matrix-dominated properties. In this work, cross-ply laminates of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy were subjected to environmental degradation using controlled ultraviolet radiation (UV) and moisture condensation and the post-exposure mechanical properties were evaluated through elastic modulus and failure strength measurements. Additionally, both degraded and undegraded were subjected to cyclic fatigue loading to investigate possible synergistic effects between environmental degradation and mechanical fatigue. Experimental results show that the degradation results in reduced failure strength. Greater effects of degradation are observed when the materials are tested under flexural as opposed to uniaxial loading. Based on strength measurements and scanning electron microscopy, we identified various damage modes resulting from exposure to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and cyclic loading. The principal mechanisms that lead to reduction in mechanical properties are the loss of fiber confinement due to matrix erosion, due to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and weakened/ cracked ply interfaces due to mechanical fatigue. An empirical relationship was established to quantify the specific influence of different damage mechanisms and to clarify the effects of various degradation conditions.",

Based on the damage observation using both an optical microscope and a soft X-ray radiography, a damage mechanics analysis is conducted to formulate the stiffness change due to transverse cracking. Then, both energy and stress criteria are combined to provide a valid procedure to predict the transverse crack evolution. The theoretical prediction is found to agree well with the experimental results for the transverse crack density as a function of strain as well as stress-strain curves. Then, another methodology is introduced using two kinds of embedded optical fiber sensors to detect and monitor the transverse crack evolution in composite laminates. One is plastic optical fibers (POF), where the loss in optical power is generated by local deformation of POF due to transverse cracking. The other is fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, where the local strain distribution within the FBG gage length due to transverse cracking alters the power spectrum of the light reflected from the FBG sensors.

Damage was found to initiate at low load levels, typically 20-30% of the failure load. The dominant initial failure mode was matrix intralaminar shear failure which occurred in sub-surface plies. The damage developed into a network of intralaminar and interlaminar shear cracks. Two different macromechanical failure modes were identified, fastener pull-through failure and global collapse of the laminate. The internal damage and ultimate failure mode were found to depend upon the laminate stacking sequence and resin system. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed to analyse the stress distribution within the laminate and predict first-ply failure.

The FMLs consist of an aluminum alloy and a self-reinforced thermoplastic composite based on polypropylene fibers in a polypropylene matrix. The scaled FML laminates were arranged in a 2/1 configuration, and ply-level scaling of the FML constituent materials was employed to yield specimens with a nominally constant composite volume fraction, as well as correctly scaled in-plane and bending stiffness properties. In the initial part of this experimental program, the tensile and flexural properties of these hybrid materials were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. Here, no significant scaling effects were observed in the mechanical response of the laminates. Following this, simply-supported scaled beams and plates were subjected to low-velocity impact loading in order to investigate scaling effects in the processes of damage development and target perforation. Here, response parameters such as the target deflection, the impact force, and the damage threshold energy were found to obey the scaling law. It is believed that experimental data of this nature will give greater confidence to engineers involved in the design of components based on hybrid materials such as fiber-metal laminates.",

The results show that pre-straining of the composite laminates has no noticeable influence on the size of the delamination area for the given impact energy of 8J, which represents a typical barely-visible impact on thin-skin composite structures. For composite scarf joints, however, resulting damage has been found to be a combination of adhesive disbonding and matrix cracking (delamination and intraply cracking) in the composite laminate. The size of this mixed type of damage increases significantly with increasing pre-strain levels. A finite element model was developed to investigate the interaction between adhesive disbonding and composite delamination. The computational results reveal that both delamination and adhesive disbonding are dominated by the mode II fracture. Since the critical mode II fracture energy release rate for composite laminates (G IIC=1.08kJ/m 2) is much less than that pertinent to the adhesive (G IIC=3.73kJ/m 2), delamination tends to occur first in the composite laminates, which then shield the growth of disbonding in the adhesive. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

(0/90/0/90)s oriented cross-ply E-glass/epoxy laminates studied were manufactured and all of the material parameters of laminated composite materials were measured experimentally. The impact testing was conducted with a specially developed vertical drop-weight testing machine. Impact tests were performed at impactor masses of 135 and 2600 g and an impact velocity of 3 m/s. The studies were carried out on plate dimensions of 150 mm × 150 mm, 150 mm × 100 mm and 150 mm × 50 mm with two opposite sides clamped and the other two free and impact load applied at the center of each plate. A numerical simulation was performed using 3DIMPACT transient dynamic finite element analysis code for calculating stresses and contact forces of the composite plates during impact along with a failure analysis for predicting the threshold of impact damage and initiation of delaminations. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There are various methods for improving their impact damage tolerance, such as fiber toughening, matrix toughening, interface toughening, through-the-thickness reinforcements, and selective interlayers and hybrids. Hybrid composites with improved impact resistance are particularly useful in military and commercial civil applications. Hybridizing composites using shape memory alloys (SMA) is one solution since SMA materials can absorb the energy of the impact through superelastic deformation or recovery stress, reducing the effects of the impact on the composite structure. The SMA material may be embedded in the hybrid composites (SMAHC) in many different forms and also the characteristics of the fiber reinforcements may vary, such as SMA wires in woven laminates or SMA foils in unidirectional laminates, only to cite two examples. We will review the state of the art of SMAHC for the purpose of damage suppression. Both the active and passive damage suppression mechanisms will be considered.",

Tensile tests on unidirectional unnotched laminates have shown that their mechanical properties follow the predictions offered by a simple law of mixtures approach. Tension-tension fatigue tests on notched unidirectional FMLs have shown that these laminates offer fatigue lives up to fifty times greater than those offered by a notched monolithic titanium alloy. An examination of the failed FMLs highlighted the presence of delamination between the titanium alloy and the fiber-reinforced composite. The experimental evidence suggests that this form of damage is harmful during fatigue loading conditions. It has also been shown that delamination is more widespread in FMLs based on thick composite layers than in laminates containing thin composite layers.",

In general, environmental degradation is observed as matrix cracking and erosion that leads to deterioration of matrix-dominated properties. In this work, cross-ply laminates of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy were subjected to environmental degradation using controlled ultraviolet radiation (UV) and moisture condensation and the post-exposure mechanical properties were evaluated through elastic modulus and failure strength measurements. Additionally, both degraded and undegraded were subjected to cyclic fatigue loading to investigate possible synergistic effects between environmental degradation and mechanical fatigue. Experimental results show that the degradation results in reduced failure strength. Greater effects of degradation are observed when the materials are tested under flexural as opposed to uniaxial loading. Based on strength measurements and scanning electron microscopy, we identified various damage modes resulting from exposure to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and cyclic loading. The principal mechanisms that lead to reduction in mechanical properties are the loss of fiber confinement due to matrix erosion, due to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and weakened/ cracked ply interfaces due to mechanical fatigue. An empirical relationship was established to quantify the specific influence of different damage mechanisms and to clarify the effects of various degradation conditions.",

In this model, failure-initiation criteria and damage evolution laws are introduced to account for the major fiber-failure modes (tensile, compressive, punch shear and crush loading). In addition, two matrices related failure modes (in-plane shear and through the thickness delamination) are also accounted for. These types of fiber and matrix failure modes are commonly observed during a ballistic event. The composite-material model has been implemented within LS-DYNA as a user-defined material subroutine and used successfully to predict the damage and ballistic behavior of composite laminates subjected to various ballistic impact conditions.

          "abstract": "The effects of through-thickness reinforcement of carbon/epoxy laminates with thin pins on the in-plane tensile properties, tensile fatigue life and failure mechanisms are investigated. Tensile studies in the 0?? fibre direction are performed on unidirectional and quasi-isotropic laminates reinforced with different volume contents and sizes of fibrous composite z-pins. Microstructural analysis reveals that z-pinning causes several types of damage, including out-of-plane fibre crimping, in-plane fibre distortion, mild dilution of the in-plane fibre volume fraction due to laminate swelling, and clusters of broken fibres. In unidirectional composites, resin pockets form around pins and coalesce into continuous resin channels at higher z-pin contents. Young&#039;s modulus falls only a few percent at most, due partly to in-plane fibre dilution and partly to fibre waviness. Monotonic tensile strength is degraded more significantly, falling linearly with both pin content and pin diameter. Comparison with prior data shows that the rate of degradation is evidently a strong function of the particular pin insertion method used. Failure mechanisms include fibre rupture, presumably affected by broken fibres, and, in unidirectional laminates, longitudinal splitting cracks emanating from resin pockets. Whereas non-pinned laminates show very modest fatigue effects, the pinned laminates exhibit strong fatigue effects, with strength falling by as much as 33% at 106 cycles. The slope of the fatigue life (S-N) curve tends to increase in magnitude with pin content and density. Limited evidence and prior literature suggest that the dominant fatigue mechanism may be progressive softening and fibre damage in misaligned segments of in-plane fibres. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In such cases, carbon fibers are both the reinforcement and the sensor to detect damage in {CFRP} laminates. The damage-detecting method of {CFRP} laminates by electrical resistance measurement that are investigated in this study is made possible by attaching electrodes on the surface of the {CFRP} structures without special manufacturing. In this paper, we investigate the electrical resistance change as a damage parameter of fatigue damage such as the degradation of residual strength and stiffness. The measured stiffness and electrical resistance change during fatigue tests showed a very similar trend of change. This is because cumulative fatigue damage is represented by the degradation of residual stiffness; these damages also cause change in electrical resistance. Thus, we can use this change in electrical resistance as a damage parameter. We also predict the future damage of composite laminates in fatigue loading from electrical resistance damage model by following a stiffness degradation model. Electrical resistance gradually increased as the stiffness reduced, and showed a very abrupt change when final fatigue failure was imminent. The predicted value showed good agreement with the experimental data except in the final stage, where stiffness and electrical resistance changed abruptly.",

          "abstract": "This paper discusses the mechanisms by which damage develops and grows around countersunk fastener holes in composite laminates under fatigue loading conditions. Experiments have shown that the erosion of material between ply layers nucleates delaminations which then grow through the laminate under the action of the fatigue loads. The damage at the hole bore surface produces sites for the nucleation of delaminations. The morphology of the delaminations and ply cracking was mapped extensively and from these maps it was found that the volume of material around the fastener hole, damaged by the fatigue loading, adopted a characteristic shape; the volume of damaged laminate increased towards the faying surface of the laminate and (metal) fixture. This characteristic damage volume was generated by the fastener rocking under the fatigue loads. Growth of the delaminations has been shown to be preceded by intraply cracking and, as fatigue loading proceeded, more delaminations were generated at the hole bore surface. The interfacial region between the composite laminate and the fixture also provided the nucleation site for fatigue cracks in the fasteners. The effects of initial fastener-hole clearances on damage nucleation and growth did not appear to follow any clear pattern. However, coupons with excessive initial hole clearances did appear to exhibit greater than expected damage growth after only one sequence block. Several techniques for the measurement of damage growth (development) were investigated. Stiffness measurements of the test system were found to show only small changes with hole wear and fastener rocking (using shadow moire techniques) also showed only small changes with hole wear. Ultrasonic C-scanning methods were used to map the extent of damage around the fastener holes with fatigue loading. The experimental work has shown that damage development around fastener holes is a complex process, usually producing several delaminations in the region of the fastener hole which grow and may ultimately lead to the failure of the coupon. ?? 1993.",

The outside diameters of the cladding and polyimide coating are 40 and 52 ??m, respectively. First, a brief summary is presented for applications of small-diameter FBG sensors to damage monitoring in composite structures. Then, we propose a new damage detection system for quantitative evaluation of delamination length in CFRP laminates using Lamb wave sensing. In this system, a piezo-ceramic actuator generates Lamb waves in a CFRP laminate. After the waves propagate in the laminate, transmitted waves are received by an FBG sensor attached on or embedded in the laminate using a newly developed high-speed optical wavelength interrogation system. This system was applied to detect interlaminar delamination in CFRP cross-ply laminates. When the Lamb waves passed through the delamination, the amplitude decreased and a new wave mode appeared. These phenomena could be well simulated using a finite element analysis. From the changes in the amplitude ratio and the arrival time of the new mode depending on the delamination length, it was found that this system could evaluate the delamination length quantitatively. Furthermore, small-diameter FBG sensors were embedded in a double-lap type coupon specimen, and the debonding progress could be evaluated using the wavelet transform. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

A vectorized user material subroutine (VUMAT) is developed to define the mechanical constitutive behaviour and Hashin&#039;s 3D failure criteria incorporating strain-rate effects in the GFPP. In order to apply localised blast loading, a user subroutine VDLOAD is used to model the pressure distribution over the exposed area of the plate.

The FE models consider FMLs based on various stacking configurations. Both the transient and permanent displacements of the laminates are investigated.

It is found that for the values of ??, where the stress in the off-axis plies normal to the fibers is tensile, ply cracks lying along fibers initiate and increase in number, while for other ?? values the plies do not undergo this damage, as expected. However, the overall laminate elastic moduli are also found to change for the ?? values where no ply cracks exist. It is postulated that a shear-induced degradation of the off-axis plies is responsible for the observed laminate moduli changes. The prediction of changes in these moduli by using the ply shear modulus measured on [????4](s) appears to support this postulate. For the case of moduli changes caused by ply cracks the recently proposed synergistic damage-mechanics approach [1] is applied.

In order to enhance the exploitation of material reserves, there is a need for the integration of progressive damage scenarios in the design phase. Due to their hazardous effects on the load-carrying capacity of composite structures, this work focusses on the simulation of delaminations. A finite element based on a cohesive zone approach is developed. Two constitutive laws are proposed. One is characterized by linear degradation after delamination onset, the other is governed by exponential softening response. The damage process is history-dependent leading to an irreversible stiffness degradation in damaged zones.

          "abstract": "The machining of the glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) laminates may generate several kinds of damage. The most serious is the delamination that may occur during drilling, and which severely compromises the mechanical characteristics of the material around the hole. The main cause of delamination is generally held to be the thrust force exerted by the drill point; the most commonly used method for reducing delamination is to place a support under the workpiece. Paradoxically, while this practice does limit delamination, the force exerted by the drill point is actually greater than in unsupported drilling. The presence of the support does influence the delamination mechanism, but exactly how that mechanism works does not seem to be fully understood yet. This study analyzes the differences in delamination mechanisms when drilling with and without a support placed under the workpiece. This investigation has led to hypothesize two main differences in the mechanism. On the basis of this analysis, a new device was designed that counters the hypothesized delamination mechanism. A simple prototype of this device was built, and its effectiveness verified. The results show that the proposed device can drastically reduce delamination. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "Hybrid Titanium Composite Laminates (HTCL) are a type of hybrid composite laminate with promise for high-speed aerospace applications, specifically designed for improved damage tolerance and strength at high-temperature (350??F, 177??C). However, in previous testing, HTCL demonstrated a propensity to excessive delamination at the titanium/PMC interface following titanium cracking. An advanced HTCL has been constructed with an emphasis on strengthening this interface, combining a PETI-5/IM7 PMC with Ti-15-3 foils prepared with an alkaline-perborate surface treatment. This paper discusses how the fatigue capabilities of the &#039;advanced&#039; HTCL compare to the first generation HTCL which was not modified for interface optimization, in both tension-tension (R=0.1) and tension-compression (R=-0.2). The advanced HTCL did not demonstrate a significant improvement in fatigue life, in either tension-tension or tension-compression loading. However, the advanced HTCL proved much more damage tolerant. The R=0.1 tests revealed that the advanced HTCL increased the fatigue life following initial titanium ply damage up to 10?? that of the initial HTCL at certain stress levels. The damage progression following the initial ply damage demonstrated the effect of the strengthened PMC/titanium interface. Acetate film replication of the advanced HTCL edges showed a propensity for some fibers in the adjacent PMC layers to fail at the point of titanium crack formation, suppressing delamination at the Ti/PMC interface. The inspection of failure surfaces validated these findings, revealing PMC fibers bonded to the majority of the titanium surfaces. Tension compression fatigue (R=-0.2) demonstrated the same trends in cycles between initial damage and failure, damage progression, and failure surfaces. Moreover, in possessing a higher resistance to delamination, the advanced HTCL did not exhibit buckling following initial titanium ply cracking under compression unlike the initial HTCL. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To develop the nanocomposite laminates, a spraying technology was used to deposit nanotubes on both sides of each four-harness satin weave carbon fiber fabric piece for the 12 ply laminate lay up. For these experimental studies the carbon fiber reinforced epoxy laminates were fabricated using a heated vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (H-VARTM®) method followed by a 2 soak curing cycle. The f-CNTs toughened the epoxy resin-fiber interfaces to mitigate the evolution of fiber/fabric-matrix interfacial cracking and delamination under both static and cyclic loadings. As a consequence, significant improvements in the mechanical properties of tensile strength, stiffness and resistance to failure due to cyclic loadings resulted for this carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminate.",

          "abstract": "A numerical model for simulating the process of low-velocity impact damage in composite laminates using the finite element method is presented in this paper, i.e. Part I of this two part series on the study of impact. In this model, the 9-node Lagrangian element of the Mindlin plate with consideration of large deformation analysis is employed. To analyze the transient response of the laminated plates, a modified Newmark time integration algorithm previously proposed by the authors is adopted here. We also proved that the impact process between a rigid ball and laminated plates is a stiff system, therefore a kind of A(α) stable method has been advocated here to solve the motion equation of the rigid ball. Furthermore, various types of damages including delamination, matrix cracking and fiber breakage, etc. and their mutual influences are modeled and investigated in detail. To overcome the difficulty of numerical oscillation or instability in the analysis of the dynamic contact problem between delaminated layers using the traditional penalty methods, we have employed dynamic spring constraints to simulate the contact effect, which are added to the numerical model by a kind of continuous penalty function. Moreover, an effective technique to calculate the strain energy release rate based on the Mindlin plate model is proposed, which can attain high precision. Finally, some techniques of adaptive analyses have been realized for improving the computational efficiency. Based on this model, a program has been developed for numerically simulating the damage process of cross-ply fiber-reinforced carbon/epoxy composite laminates under low-velocity impact load. In Part II, this numerical model will be verified by comparing with the experimental results. Also the impact damage will be investigated in detail using this numerical approach. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Monotonic tensile tests performed on [03/903]S laminates at 120 ??C have shown a marked dependence of cracking development on loading rate. This paper aims to assess the impact of the material nonlinearity on the loading rate sensitivity of the damaging process. A &quot;shear-lag&quot; damage analysis, using the nonlinear correspondence principle and appropriate failure criteria, is carried out to numerically predict the cracking evolution. This work shows that, though important, the material nonlinearity of the undamaged material does not significantly enhance the loading rate sensitivity of the cracking process and it cannot explain alone the phenomenon. On the other hand, taking into account the loading rate dependence of the critical strength, together with the R-curve effect, which gives good predicted cracking curves, suggests that the observed rate effect pertains to the viscoelastic character of the damaged material in the process zone close to crack fronts. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The characterisation of the damage state of composite structures is often performed using the acoustic behaviour of the composite system. This behaviour is expected to change significantly as the damage is accumulating in the composite. It is indisputable that different damage mechanisms are activated within the composite laminate during loading scenario. These &quot;damage entities&quot; are acting in different space and time scales within the service life of the structure and may be interdependent. It has been argued that different damage mechanisms attribute distinct acoustic behaviour to the composite system. Loading of cross-ply laminates in particular leads to the accumulation of distinct damage mechanisms, such as matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fibre rupture at the final stage of loading. As highlighted in this work, the acoustic emission activity is directly linked to the structural health state of the laminate. At the same time, significant changes on the wave propagation characteristics are reported and correlated to damage accumulation in the composite laminate. In the case of cross ply laminates, experimental tests and numerical simulations indicate that, typical to the presence of transverse cracking and/or delamination, is the increase of the pulse velocity and the transmission efficiency of a propagated ultrasonic wave, an indication that the intact longitudinal plies act as wave guides, as the transverse ply deteriorates. Further to transverse cracking and delamination, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing the catastrophic failure of the composite and is expected to be directly linked to the acoustic behaviour of the composite, as the stiffness loss results to the velocity decrease of the propagated wave. In view of the above, the scope of the current work is to assess the efficiency of acoustic emission and ultrasonic transmission as a combined methodology for the assessment of the introduced damage and furthermore as a structural health monitoring tool. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The exact behaviour depended on the thickness to diameter ratio, but at incident energies up to fibre damage the impact responses were very similar for all lay-ups. Fibre damage was most severe for CSM and CSM/WR laminates. The WR and Kevlar/WR laminates were most resilient to fibre damage, but the Kevlar/WR did not perform better than the WR laminate.

The dissipated energy is correlated to the crack density growth data recorded for a reference laminate. The critical strain energy release rate, Gc obtained in this way is increasing with the applied strain. This phenomenon reflects the statistical nature of Gc distribution in the 90-layer: the first cracks (lower strain) develop in positions with lower fracture toughness. The obtained Gc data are in a good agreement with fracture toughness data obtained using LEFM based &quot;compliance calibration&quot; model in which the stiffness change with increasing strain is used. Finally, the matrix cracking development is successfully simulated using in the LEFM model, the data for critical strain energy release rate and an earlier derived stiffness-crack density relationship. It has been demonstrated that knowing the laminates geometry and measuring the laminate stiffness reduction with strain or (alternatively measuring the dissipated energy) the damage evolution may be simulated, thus reducing the necessity for optical observations to validation only. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Delamination tests under three mixed I/II mode ratios were carried out via mixed mode bending test apparatus.

In this paper, a formerly developed modified Paris Law with the normalized strain energy release rate as the fracture governing parameter is investigated again. The results from the multidirectional delamination tests fit the modified Paris Law very well, and hence have validated it by experiments. Moreover, the thresholds normalized to delamination resistance were utilized to evaluate the critical fatigue crack growth conditions. By the combination of test data for both 0??/5?? and 90??/90?? laminates, an interface-independent normalized threshold was proposed, which was found linearly decreasing with mode mixture ratios. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

This was followed by a series of perforation tests on multilayer configurations.It has been shown that both the composite and the aluminum substrates exhibit a low degree of rate-sensitivity, with both the tensile strength and the perforation energy increasing slightly in passing from quasi-static to dynamic rates of loading. Similarly, FMLs based on combinations of the composite and metal constituents exhibit a low degree of rate-sensitivity, with the impact perforation energy and the maximum impact force being only ten to fifteen percent higher than their quasi-static values. An examination of the cross-sections of the failed laminates indicated that the failure processes were similar at both quasi-static and dynamic rates of strain. Also, similar levels of plastic deformation, fiber fracture and delamination were observed at both rates. Finally, it has been shown that the energy to perforate the various FMLs is directly related to the aggregated perforation energies of their constituent parts.",

There are three major failure modes in composites-namely, fiber failure, matrix failure, and fiber/matrix interfacial failure. Because, in general, the stresses in the fiber and matrix are different; their respective failures are determined by different stresses and have different failure mechanisms. Thus, a lamina failure criterion that separates matrix failure from fiber failure, such as the Hashin-Rotem criterion, is mechanistically more appropriate. The ply-by-ply discount method with parallel spring stiffness reduction model is used in the prediction. Laminate ply-by-ply failure analysis is performed on the basis of the 2-D stress field in the laminate. The stress/strain behavior of four laminates under uniaxial or biaxial loading is predicted by considering both material nonlinearity and progressive matrix cracking. Material nonlinearity is considered by using a one-parameter plasticity model for fiber reinforced composites. Progressive matrix cracking and the corresponding stiffness reduction are predicted by the use of a simplified shear-lag analysis and finite element analysis.",

Some new and effective techniques have also been put forward in that paper, which can significantly increase the computational efficiency. In the current paper, i.e. Part II of the two-part series on the study of impact of composites, we focus on the following two aspects: (a) verification of our numerical model through the comparison with other researchers&#039; results; (b) investigation of the impact-induced damage in the laminated plates using the present numerical model. For the first aspect, some previous experimental data have been adopted for comparison to validate the present numerical model. For the second, we have mainly studied the effects on the impact damage in detail in such aspects as the size of target plate, the boundary conditions of target plate, impact velocity, impactor mass, etc. From these computations, the understanding of the low-velocity impact damage in laminates can be improved. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Thermal deply and C-scan techniques are used to observe the internal damage characteristics of laminates induced by static indentation. The results indicate that the dent depth increases slowly and almost linearly as the force is lower than its maximum. The observation shows that the damage induced at this loading stage includes matrix cracking and delamination only. Once the force exceeds the maximum, the dent depth increases sharply while the force remains almost unchanged. Deply test results demonstrate that the transition to rapid increase in dent depth is due to the fiber breakage produced at this loading stage. The results also indicate that the damage resistance of a composite laminate can be characterized by the maximum contact force. On the basis of this principle and test results, it is concluded that the damage resistance of toughened composite is much higher than that of brittle one. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This kind of composite materials are commonly used for automotive functional and structural applications. To this aim, a multi-scale experimental approach is developed. The deformation processes and the damage mechanisms observed at the microscopic scale are related to the material mechanical properties at the macroscopic scale. Tensile tests up to failure and specific interrupted tensile tests have been optimized and performed for high strain rates up to 200 s-1 to quantify the strain rate effect at different scales. High speed tensile tests have also been performed on the pure copolymer matrix. The threshold and the kinetic of damage have been quantified at both microscopic and macroscopic scales. Experimental results show that the composite behavior is strongly strain-rate dependent. The multi-scale analysis leads to the conclusion that the strain rate effect on the damage behavior of the EPC matrix composite is mainly due to the viscous behavior of the EPC matrix. SEM observations and analysis show that a localized deformation in the interface zone around fibers occurs at high strain rates and directly affects the visco-damage behavior. It is established that when the strain rate increases, the local deformation zone around the fibers behaves like a dissipation zone. Consequently, the damage initiation is delayed and the related kinetic is reduced with respect to the quasi-static loading case. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Composite panels are in common use, especially in aeronautic and aerospace structures due to their high strength/weight and stiffness/weight ratio. The out-of-plane impact loading is considered potentially dangerous mainly because the damage may be left undetected and because the loading itself acts in the through-the-thickness direction of the laminated composite panel. This direction is the weakest in the composite since no fibres are present in that direction. The impact loading can lead to damage involving three modes of failure: matrix cracking, delamination and eventually fibre breakage for higher impact energies. Even when no visible impact damage is observed at the surface on the point of impact, matrix cracking and delamination can occur, and the residual strength of the composite is considerably reduced. The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of the damage growth of impacted composite laminates when subjected to impact loading. For this purpose a series of impact tests were carried out on composite laminates made of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin matrix. An instrumented drop-weight-testing was used together with a C-scan ultrasonic device for the damage identification. Two stacking sequences of two different epoxy resins and carbon fibres, representative of four different elastic behaviours with a different number of interfaces were used. A numerical evaluation of these specimens was also carried out, using static analysis only. Results showed that the delaminated area due to impact loading depends on the number of interfaces between plies. Two failure mechanisms due to impact were identified, which are influenced by the stacking sequence and by the thickness of the panels.",

Three stacking sequences are considered. First, a baseline laminate with conventional 0°, ±45° and 90° orientations and without ply clustering. The other two laminates are dispersed laminates with orientations not limited to the conventional ones. In one of them, four layers of 0° fiber orientation are clustered together at the specimen mid-plane, whereas in the last configuration, two clusters of two layers of 0° fiber orientation are introduced at the specimen top and bottom surfaces. The in-plane and the out-of-plane stiffness of the dispersed laminates match within 2% those of the baseline laminate. Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is used to select the stacking sequences with the desirable clustering and stiffness constraints. The results obtained demonstrate that introducing clustering had a negative effect on the maximum peak load recorded at different impact energies and also on the projected delamination area.

The digital image correlation method (DICM) is a whole-field technique that calculates surface displacements and strains from digital images characterized by a random distribution of intensity grey levels.  Graphite/PEEK (polyether ether ketone) and graphite/epoxy laminates with different stacking sequences were analysed and the damage progression near the stress riser was evaluated by means of the strain maps obtained by digital image correlation. It was found that damage developing before final fracture may significantly affect the structural performance of composite laminates. The digital image correlation technique allowed clarification of the beneficial or detrimental role played by the different failure mechanisms on the strain redistribution around the hole and, as a consequence, on the residual strength and fatigue life of notched samples.  The findings of the investigation suggest that the DICM is an efficient and reliable tool for full-field monitoring and detailed damage characterization of structural composite elements.",

However, the mechanical behavior of composite laminates is very complex due the inherent anisotropy and heterogeneity. Many researchers have developed different failure progressive analyses and damage models in order to predict the complex failure mechanisms. This work presents a damage model and progressive failure analysis that requires simple experimental tests and that achieves good accuracy. Firstly, the paper explains damage initiation and propagation criteria and a procedure to identify the material parameters. In the second stage, the model was implemented as a UMAT (User Material Subroutine), which is linked to finite element software, ABAQUS???, in order to predict the composite structures behavior. Afterwards, some case studies, mainly off-axis coupons under tensile or compression loads, with different types of stacking sequence were analyzed using the proposed material model. Finally, the computational results were compared to the experimental results, verifying the capability of the damage model in order to predict the composite structure behavior. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Numerical studies on the failure of composites have mostly employed the finite element method. However, it can be rather challenging to predict failure using this method. The assumption of lamina homogeneity is questionable when predicting failure, though it is suitable for stress analysis. Matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination are inherent to the inhomogeneous nature of the composite, thus the assumption of material homogeneity taints the failure prediction. It is, therefore, essential that the inhomogeneous nature of the composites must be retained in the analysis in order to predict the correct failure modes. Hence, this study considers distinct properties of the fiber and matrix and their volume fractions and fiber orientations while modeling composite laminates. The peridynamic theory is employed to predict the damage in center-cracked laminates with different fiber orientations. The predictions from the peridynamic analysis agree with the experimental observations published in the literature. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Damage is assumed to initiate when one of Hashin&#039;s failure criteria is satisfied, and its evolution is modeled by an empirical relation proposed by Matzenmiller, Lubliner and Taylor. The transient nonlinear problem is solved by the finite element method (FEM). Contributions of the work include considering damage in 3-D rather than plane stress deformations of a laminated structure and elasto-plastic deformations of the composite. This has been accomplished by developing a user defined subroutine and implementing it in the FE software ABAQUS. From strains supplied by ABAQUS the material subroutine uses a micro-mechanics approach based on the method of cells and values of material parameters of constituents to calculate average stresses in an FE, and checks for Hashin&#039;s failure criteria. If damage has initiated in the material, the subroutine evaluates the damage developed, computes resulting stresses, and provides them to ABAQUS. The damage evolved at a material point is not allowed to decrease during unloading. The delamination failure mode is simulated by using the cohesive zone model available in ABAQUS. The computed time histories of the axial load acting on the impactor are found to agree well with the experimental ones available in the literature, and various damage and failure modes agree qualitatively with those observed in tests. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Recent advances of health monitoring technologies have resulted in development of micro-dimensional sensors that can be embedded into composite laminates. Notwithstanding their small sizes, such inclusions may affect the response of the composite. Damage induced by the peak values of stress concentration around the embedded devices is, in fact, one of the main concerns. To assess this and related issues, we have fabricated a series of samples with and without embedded (dummy) sensors and micro-processors in S2 glass fiber/epoxy laminates, and systematically tested the samples while continuously monitoring the response by the acoustic emission technique. In this manner we have sought to address the process of damage initiation and evolution within the material. The results show that acoustic events begin earlier on during the loading process, in specimens with embedded sensors and the source of the damage is located near the sensors. These early events are associated with matrix failure at the sensor-resin interfaces through micrographic observations.",

Design/miethodology/approach - This involves experimental investigation of FRP composites with woven roving fibers and matrix. Different types of composites, i.e. glass: epoxy, glass: polyester and (carbon + glass): epoxy are used in the investigation with change in percentage of constituents. The variability of fiber content of the composite is in the range of 0.55-0.65 weight fractions. The matrix dominated property, like inter laminar shear strength (ILSS) has been studied by three point bend test using INSTRON 1195 material testing machine with increasing five cross head velocities. Findings - The variation of ILSS of laminates of FRP composites is significant for low loading speed and is not so prominent for high speed. The variation of ILSS are observed to be dependent on the type and amount of constituents present in the composites. The laminates with carbon fiber shows higher ILSS than that of glass fiber composites. The laminates with epoxy matrix shows higher ILSS than polyester matrix composites for the same fiber. There is no significant variation of ILSS beyond loading speed 200 mm/min and this can be used for specifications of testing. Matrix resins such as polyester and epoxy are known to be highly rate sensitive. Carbon fiber are relatively rate independent and E-glass fibers are rate sensitive. Woven roving carbon glass fiber reinforced polymer shows small rate dependence and woven roving glass fiber reinforced polymer shows significant rate sensitivity. Originality/value - The findings are based on original experimental investigations in the laboratories of the institute and can be used for characterization of composites.",

          "abstract": "Recent experimental efforts have established the significance of the fibre-matrix interface /interphase in the long-term behaviour of polymeric composites. Results indicate that small alterations at the interface level could translate into orders-of-magnitude changes in fatigue life. However, there is no model currently available in the literature to predict these changes. In this paper, a micromechanics model that includes the effects of the fibre-matrix interface is used in a simple cumulative damage scheme to predict the tensile fatigue behaviour of composite laminates. A new parameter called the &#039;efficiency of the interface&#039; is used to model the degradation of the in terface under fatigue loading. A rate equation that describes the changes in interfacial efficiency as a function of cycles is estimated using experimentally determined stiffness reduction data. The influence of this interfacial efficiency parameter on the tensile strength of unidirectional laminates is assessed using a micromechanics model. The effect of damage on the stiffness of the laminate is estimated by solving a boundary value problem associated with the particular damage mode (e.g. transverse matrix cracking). The fatigue life of the laminate is estimated by considering changes in stiffness due to creep and damage in the subcritical elements, and changes in strength associated with the critical element (0?? ply). The influence of a fibre-matrix interface is included in the model by considering the degradation in the interface (interfacial efficiency) under fatigue loading. Changes in the interface property are used in the micromechanics model to estimate changes in the in-situ tensile strength of the 0?? ply. The stress state and the strength of the 0?? ply, calculated including the effects of damage, are then used in a maximum strain failure criterion to determine the fatigue life of the laminate. Predictions from this model are compared with experimental data. The predicted fatigue life and failure modes agree very well with the experimental data. ?? 1995.",

Although many scientists have investigated the energy absorption characteristics in various continuous fiber reinforced composite materials and their dependence on strain rate, there is very little literature available on the energy absorption and crushing characteristics of random chopped fiber reinforced composite materials and their strain rate dependence. Therefore, the primary goal was to determine the crashworthiness of various random chopped carbon fiber composite material systems. To meet this goal, first an experimental set up was developed for discerning the deformation behavior and damage mechanisms that oc- cur during the progressive crushing of composite materials. The three different random chopped carbon reinforced ep- oxy composite material systems studied were P4, HexMC, and CCS100. Quasi-static progressive crush tests were then performed on these random chopped carbon fiber composite plates to determine their crashworthiness. In addition, an attempt was made to investigate and characterize the strain rate effects on the energy absorption of a random chopped carbon fiber P4 composite. The specific energy absorption was found to increase with increasing loading rate from 15.2 to 762 cm/min.",

In order to make use of a simple loading device, a mode-II case is used as the basis of the experimental study. The position of the crack is recorded quantitatively by means of a high-speed camera and dedicated image processing techniques. The delamination process is modeled by means of an interfacial Continuum Damage Model (CDM), similar to Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) approaches. In order to make suitable comparison between test and explicit finite element simulation of the test, criterai of proper temporal and spatial discretization have been derived. They ensure a fine description of the process zone and a proper description of the degradation evolution of the interface. Using such simulations and direct comparisons with the tests results, it is shown that the experimental results cannot be reproduced numerically without introducing rate effects. Then, it is proposed and identified by means of comparison between experiments and numerical simulation a bounded-damage-rate interfacial model. The main consequence of the proposed rate-dependent model is that it introduces a maximum crack velocity which is a function of the maximum damage rate. The dependence of the critical energy release rate on the crack’s velocity is analyzed, which leads to the identification of an equivalent rate-dependent fracture mechanics criterion.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates the feasibility of utilizing adaptive kinematics to reduce the computational effort of finite element modeling of progressive damage and global failure in fiber-reinforced composite laminates. In the present context, adaptive kinematics refers to the selective use of different types of macroscopic laminate models for different regions of the computational domain, based on the solution complexity within each region. Each of these macroscopic laminate models can be distinguished by the manner in which the displacement field is assumed to vary through the thickness of the laminate. In the present study, kinematic adaptivity is made possible through the use of variable kinematic finite elements (VKFE) that are developed by hierarchically combining two or more types of assumed displacement fields in a single finite element domain. The hierarchical data structure of the VKFE greatly simplifies the process of connecting elements that represent different types of laminate theories, thus facilitating adaptive analysis. The adaptive kinematic concept is demonstrated for the bending of simply supported laminates that exhibit diffuse, widespread damage and laminate tensile test specimens that exhibit very intense localized damage due to the free edge effect. The results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate that the use of adaptive kinematics can significantly reduce the overall computational effort of progressive damage solutions without compromising solution accuracy.",

These damage events combine to produce a damage state which controls the state of stress and the state of strength of the degraded laminate. Although data have been generated dealing with various details of this process, an understanding or philosophy of the precise nature of damage development has not, heretofore, been developed. This paper makes such an attempt for the general case of damage development in laminated plates under cyclic (fatigue) loading. The philosophy is based on the discovery of a ‘characteristic damage state’ in such plates which forms independently of load history, and is determined only by the properties of the laminae, their orientations, and their stacking sequence. The detailed nature of this characteristic damage state, the nature of its formation, and its influence on strength, life and stiffness is discussed. The general need for further work in this, and related fields is also assessed.",

The finite element (FE) method was employed to simulate the behaviour of the composite under low velocity impact.

The damage model was implemented in the FE code (Abaqus/Explicit) by a user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT).

A finite element-based numerical scheme is also developed to evaluate the critical strain energy release rate, GIc, associated with matrix micro-cracking, a parameter that previously required fitting with experimental data. Furthermore, the prediction scheme is improved to account for the statistical variation of GIc within the material volume by using a two-parameter Weibull distribution. The variation of GIc with increasing crack density is also accounted for based on reported experimental evidence. The simulated results for carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy cross-ply laminates demonstrate the ability of the improved model to predict the evolution of multidirectional ply cracking. By integrating this damage evolution model with the synergistic damage mechanics approach for stiffness degradation, the stress-strain response of the studied laminates is predicted. Finally, biaxial stress envelopes for ply crack initiation and pre-determined stiffness degradation levels are predicted to serve as representative examples of stiffness-based design and failure criterion.",

This kind of approach is predictive for different laminate layups and takes also into account the effects of ply failures on the macroscopic behaviour and the final laminate failure. For the first time to our knowledge, the viscosity of the matrix was introduced into the model for a more realistic description of the mesoscopic behaviour, especially for the non-linearity under shear loading. The mesoscopic failure criterion is based on physical principles and makes a distinction between the fibre failure and the interfibre failure modes. In order to describe the progressive failure of a laminate (ply after ply), a progressive degradation model, based on thermodynamical damage models, was developed. The definition of the final failure is also improved in order to predict the final failure more accurately, especially for [????]s laminates. Finally, some results (stress vs. strain laminate responses and macroscopic failure envelopes) are presented and compared with test data found in the literature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

But their strength awfully degrade, if experience some external and internal damage. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of two common damage types; impact and drilling on compression strength of woven carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites. For this purpose, combined loading compression test (CLC) was carried out for the compression behavior of un-damaged composite laminate. Compression after impact test (CAI) and open-hole compressive test (OHC) were carried out for the compression behavior of impact damaged and drill damaged composite laminates respectively. The fracture surfaces obtained after CAI and OHC tests were studied under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results showed that impact damage has more deleterious effect on the compression strength of composite laminate than drilling. The micro-buckling of fibers in the kink band found to be the dominant final failure mechanism for each type of failure under compressive loading. Whereas damage mechanisms such as interlaminar shearing, constituent (i.e., matrix and fiber) microcracking, and longitudinal splitting were found to play some role in the propagation of initial cracks/microcracks due to impact and drilling. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Low velocity impact testing has shown that the specific perforation energy of the CF/PEEK-based FMLs is similar to that offered by the CF/PEEK composite. In contrast, the specific perforation energy of the GF/PEI FML system is lower than that of the plain PEI composite. The experimental evidence suggests that the inclusion of strong titanium alloy plies does not improve the perforation resistance of these FMLs. High velocity impact tests resulted in failure processes similar to those observed under low velocity loading conditions, with the specific perforation energy of the GF/PEI-based FMLs being higher than those exhibited by the plain GF/PEI composite.

Performance in service of these composites is affected by multi-mechanism damage evolution under loading and environmental conditions. For instance, carbon fibre-reinforced laminates demonstrate a wide spectrum of failure mechanisms such as matrix cracking and delamination. These damage mechanisms can result in significant deterioration of the residual stiffness and load-bearing capacity of composite components and should be thoroughly investigated. The delamination failure mechanism is studied in this paper for a double cantilever beam (DCB) loaded in mode I. Several sensitivity studies are performed to analyse the effects of mesh density and of parameters of the cohesive law on the character of damage propagation in laminates. The microstructural randomness of laminates that is responsible for non-uniform distributions of stresses in them even under uniform loading conditions is accounted for in the model. The random properties are introduced with the use of Weibull&#039;s two-parameter probability density function. Several statistical realisations are carried out which show that the effect of microstructure could significantly affect the macroscopic response emphasizing the need to account for microstructural randomness for accurate predictions of load-carrying capacity of laminate composite structures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

C-scan inspections showed that impact led to diamond-shaped damage resulting from different failure mechanisms: fiber breakages in warp and weft directions, more or less inter-laminar and intra-ply damage, and extensive delamination in C/PEEK and C/epoxy laminates. The permanent indentation can be ascribed to specific mechanisms which mainly depend on many factors including the ultimate out-of-plane shear strength, and the interlaminar fracture toughness in modes I-II-III. In TP-based laminates, the matrix plasticization seems to play an important role in matrix-rich areas by locally promoting permanent deformations. Fiber-bridging also prevents the plies from opening in mode I, and slows down the propagation of interlaminar and intralaminar cracks in modes II-III. Both mechanisms seem to reduce the extension of damages, in particular, the subsequent delamination for a given impact energy. In epoxy-based laminates, the debris of broken fibers and matrix get stuck in the cracks and the adjacent layers, and create a sort of blocking system that prevents the cracks and delamination from closing after impact. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The potential of this simulation approach for correctly predicting the through-thickness distribution of internal damage was specifically examined in the study. The constitutive models for intralaminar and interlaminar damage modes were incorporated into the ABAQUS/Explicit FE code by user-defined VUMAT material subroutines. The results of numerical simulations were compared with experimental data obtained by drop-weight impact testing and stereoscopic X-radiography. The developed FE model provided a correct prediction of the structural impact response of laminated samples over the range of impact energies examined and successfully simulated the temporal sequence of the major damage mechanisms. A reasonably good agreement was also achieved between numerical predictions and experimental observations in terms of shapes, orientations and sizes of individual delaminations induced by impact at the different interfaces. Additional numerical analyses were also conducted to investigate the influence of simulated intralaminar damage modes on the prediction of interface delaminations. The analyses show that implementation of intralaminar damage modes may be required for accurate simulation of the three dimensional delamination pattern induced by impact. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

In engineering practice, there are many situations in which structures undergo impact or dynamic loading. In particular, the impact response of concrete beams strengthened with composite materials is of interest. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation conducted to study the impact effects on concrete beams strengthened with fiber- reinforced polymer laminates. Two types of composite laminates, carbon and Kevlar, were bonded to the top and bottom faces of concrete beams with epoxy. Five beams were tested: two strengthened with Kevlar laminates, two strengthened with carbon laminates, and one unretrofitted beam as the control specimen. The impact load was applied by dropping a steel cylinder from a specified height onto the top face of the beam. The test results revealed that composite laminates significantly increased the capacity of the concrete beams to resist impact load. In addition, the laminates reduced the deflection and crack width. Comparing the test results of the beams strengthened with Kevlar and carbon laminates indicated that the gain in strength depends on the type, thickness, weight, and material properties of the composite laminate.",

Fibre metal laminates are hybrid composite materials built up from interlacing layers of thin metals and fibre reinforced adhesives. The most commercially available fibre metal laminates (FMLs) are ARALL (Aramid Reinforced Aluminium Laminate), based on aramid fibres, GLARE (Glass Reinforced Aluminium Laminate), based on high strength glass fibres and CARALL (Carbon Reinforced Aluminium Laminate), based on carbon fibres. Taking advantage of the hybrid nature from their two key constituents: metals (mostly aluminium) and fibre-reinforced laminate, these composites offer several advantages such as better damage tolerance to fatigue crack growth and impact damage especially for aircraft applications. Metallic layers and fibre reinforced laminate can be bonded by classical techniques, i.e. mechanically and adhesively. Adhesively bonded fibre metal laminates have been shown to be far more fatigue resistant than equivalent mechanically bonded structures. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Two types of fiber optic sensors, namely fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) and Doppler effect-based fiber optic (FOD) sensors, were addressed and guided wave detection systems were constructed for both types. Guided waves generated by a piezoelectric transducer were propagated through a quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate and acquired by these fiber optic sensors. Characteristics of these fiber optic sensors in ultrasonic guided wave detection were systematically compared. Results demonstrated that both the FBG and FOD sensors can be applied in guided wave and damage detection for the CFRP laminates. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of guided wave signal captured by an FOD sensor is relatively high in comparison with that of the FBG sensor because of their different physical principles in ultrasonic detection. Further, the FOD sensor is sensitive to the damage-induced fundamental shear horizontal (SH0) guided wave that, however, cannot be detected by using the FBG sensor, because the FOD sensor is omnidirectional in ultrasound detection and, in contrast, the FBG sensor is severely direction dependent.",

It revealed that matrix cracking, delaminations, tow debonding, and fibre fracture were the prominent damage modes. Three-dimensional finite-element models are developed to study the onset, progression and interaction of some damage modes such as delamination and fabric fracture observed with micro-CT. A damage modelling technique based on a cohesive-zone method, which is more efficient than continuum damage mechanics approach, is proposed for analysis of interaction of damage modes. The developed numerical models are capable to simulate the damage mechanisms and their interaction observed in the tests.

The originators (or their collaborators) of those theories have employed their methods to 13 carefully selected challenging problems (test cases) addressing the cracking and damage evolution arising from ply thickness, lay-up sequence, size effects and a variety of loading conditions (biaxial, bending, thermal loading and loading-unloading) of a number of unidirectional and multi-directional glass and carbon epoxy laminates. These covered eight different lay-ups consisting of 0 , [0 /90 /0 ], [0 /90 8/0 ], [0 /90 ]s, [±45 ]s, [±50 ]s, [30 /90 /-30 /90 ]s and a family of [0 m/45 m/90 m/-45 m]s, [45 /0 /90 /-45 ]s and [0 /45 /-45 /90 ]s quasi-isotropic laminates. Key features in each theory are identified including: types of damage models employed, whether linear or nonlinear analysis was carried out, reliance on software and numerical methods and identification of modes of damage. The results of stress-strain curves, crack density and damage curves have been superimposed and bar charts were constructed to show similarities and differences between the predictions of the various theories. © The Author(s) 2013.",

Most studies in literature have addressed single point isolated impact events; while this work draws distinction in that we consider multi-site sequential and simultaneous impacts to composite structures. The overall objectives of this work were to investigate the response of laminated composites subjected to high velocity, multi-site impacts from a modeling and experimental viewpoint. Energy absorption, new surface creation, and failure mechanisms from sequential and simultaneous multi-site high velocity impacts are compared to assess additive and cumulative effects of these scenarios. Finite element modeling (LS-DYNA 3D) was used to gain insight into failure modes, energy absorption, and damage prediction. The modeling results correlated well with experimental data obtained from three layer laminates of vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) processed S2-glass/SC-15 epoxy. The impact damage has been characterized using optical nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. Specimens subjected to sequential impact exhibited average of 10% greater energy absorption and 18% increase in damage than specimens impacted simultaneously. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",

Matrix cracking parallel to the fibres in the off-axis plies is the first intralaminar damage mode observed.

This paper summarises recent theoretical modelling developed by the authors on stiffness property degradation and mechanical behaviour of general symmetric laminates with off-axis ply cracks and crack-induced delaminations. Closed-form analytical expressions are derived for Mode I, Mode II and the total strain energy release rates associated with these damage modes. Dependence of strain energy release rates on crack density, delamination area and ply orientation angle in balanced and unbalanced symmetric laminates is examined and discussed.

Mechanisms for crack initiation and growth were studied by optical microscopy. The strain at the onset of transverse cracking, ??TOS, increased and the slope, K, of the curve of crack density as a function of strain decreased as the GIC of the matrix increased. Improved fiber/matrix adhesion and lower fiber content had similar effects. The properties of polyester-based composites were usually inferior to those of vinylester composites as a consequence of pre-existing debonds and subcritical cracks resulting from microlevel curing stresses.

Post-impact examination of damage is carried out by visual inspection, diametric cross-sectioning, and ultrasonic C-scanning. A number of damage mechanisms have been observed, and their influence on impact behaviour is found to be generally dependent on the impact force or incident kinetic energy (IKE) level. Although post-impact techniques are very useful, impact force and IKE histories derived by using an instrumented drop-weight impact rig are essential to the quantitative interpretation of damage development.

Uniaxial tension behaviors of KBFBs and KBFB-reinforced epoxy strands were evaluated statistically using large sample sets. The elastic modulus, tensile strength, as well as failure strains of KBFBs, displayed large scatter statistically ranging from 10% to 30%. The loading rate-dependency was evaluated at three strain rates ranging from approximately 10-4 ??? 10-2/s. The tensile strength increases gradually as the loading rate increases, while the tensile modulus almost remains the same as the loading rate increases until the loading rate reaches 10-2/s, at which a much higher modulus was presented. The high temperatures (170-180 ??C), possibly subjected during fiber processing and composite fabrication, do not impose significant effects on the tensile properties of KBFBs if the duration is less than 1-h. The tensile properties of KBFB were not affected by the conditioning at 130 ??C for 24-h, which mimics the severe service temperature of automotive front-end components. KBFB-epoxy composite strands were further evaluated at various loading rates.

Previous studies show that tension–compression fatigue is more detrimental than tension–tension fatigue to transverse and multidirectional laminates. By analysing the debonding mechanisms and modelling thereof, the macroscopic fatigue behaviour can be better understood. Also, the dominant crack-propagation mode can be identified which may be of use in selection of constituent material properties to optimise fatigue resistance. In this study, glass-fibre-reinforced vinyl-ester was used. The adverse effect of compressive load excursions was verified by counting the transverse cracks in cross-ply laminates. The mechanisms were studied in low-cycle fatigue of a specimen containing a single transverse fibre. Compressive load cycles led to significantly increased debond growth. In tension, contact zones developed at the crack tips for sufficiently large debonds. Because of the mismatch in elastic properties, an opening zone appeared at the tips of the interfacial crack when the same debond was subjected to a compressive load. Since debond propagation is more susceptible to mode I loading, the sensitivity to tension–compression fatigue is explained by the effective crack-tip opening in compressive loading for sufficiently large debond cracks. This has also been verified by finite-element analysis.",

This is due to their poor transverse strengths and low delamination fracture toughness. In drilling, delamination is initiated when the thrust force exceeds a threshold value, particularly at the critical entry and exit locations of the drill bit. To minimize damage, therefore, it is important to monitor process variables such as the machining forces and the position of the tool relative to the workpiece. The availability of a suitable model coupled with an intelligent control scheme would be a large advancement in the machining of composite laminates. This paper explores the development of such models for machining of composites and for coupling the models to intelligent control strategies. Using a machining center, a series of drilling experiments were conducted on carbon fiber-reinforced composite laminates to determine key process parameters for various cutting conditions. An intelligent machining scheme is proposed as the basis for the design of a new machine tool.",

          "abstract": "In the present study, the compressive failure mechanism of quasi-isotropic composite laminates with an open hole was experimentally and numerically studied to explain the mechanical meaning of the open hole compression (OHC) strength. In the experiment, we adopted a fixture for the OHC test method proposed by the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL III). Two types of composite systems were tested to examine the dependence of failure behavior on the material properties such as interlaminar toughness. The damage which appeared first was fiber micro-buckling in the 0?? layer. Some accumulation of damage, such as further fiber micro-buckling in the 0?? layers and interlaminar delaminations in several interfaces, was observed before the final unstable fracture in the laminate with high interlaminar toughness, while sudden failure occurred in the laminate with low interlaminar toughness. In the numerical study, a full three-dimensional finite element analysis was conducted. At the transverse edge of the hole, not only stress singularity at the interface but also high stress concentration at the 0?? layers was obtained. Singular stress at the interfaces decreased quickly to a level much below the interlaminar strength. To consider the effect of micro-buckling on the stress redistribution and further damage accumulation, a damage analysis was conducted by reducing the stiffness components of the corresponding elements to 1/10. When one element was damaged, the maximum stress next to the damaged element became higher than the maximum stress for the intact laminate. The maximum stress decreased with the increase in number of the damaged element in the transverse direction and became lower than that for intact laminate after some extension of the damage area. This result indicates that some unstable damage progress of limited size would be expected just at the first damage occurrence and a stable increase of damage would follow it with further compressive load increase until other damage systems occurred. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "A robust multiscale scheme referred to as micro-macro method has been developed for the prediction of localized damage in fiber reinforced composites and implemented in a finite element framework. The micro-macro method is based on the idea of partial homogenization of a structure. In this method, the microstructural details are included in a small region of interest in the structure and the rest is modeled as a homogeneous continuum. The solution to the microstructural fields is then obtained on solving the two different domains, simultaneously. This method accurately predicts local stress fields in stress concentration regions and is computationally efficient as compared with the solution of a full scale microstructural model. This scheme has been applied to obtain localized damage at high and low stress zones of a V-notched rail shear specimen. The prominent damage mechanisms under shear loading, namely, matrix cracking and interfacial debonding, have been modeled using Mohr-Coulomb plasticity and traction separation law, respectively. The average stress at the notch has been found to be 44% higher than the average stresses away from the notch for a 90. N shear load. This stress rise is a direct outcome of the geometry of the notch. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The paper studies the effect of edge stitching on tensile static and fatigue properties of graphite fiber reinforced laminates. The influence of Kevlar stitchings on edge delaminations, ultimate tensile strength and tension-tension fatigue life were examined on laminates of two stacking sequences ([??45/0/90]s and [??30/90]s), as representative of two classes of fiber-dominated and matrix-dominated laminates. Through-thickness stitching offered a significant improvement in the static delamination resistance of laminated composites, but had varying effects on the ultimate tensile stress of the laminates under study, with an increase in strength of [??30/90]s laminates and a decrease in strength of [??45/0/90]s laminates. Similarly the fatigue life of matrix dominated [??30/90]s specimens was considerably extended by stitching, while the fatigue resistance of fiber-dominated [??45/0/90]s specimens was reduced, particularly at high fatigue stresses. Stitching appeared very efficient in arresting delamination in [??30/90]s specimens for both static and fatigue loads, but did not prove to be as efficient in stopping fatigue delaminations in [??45/0/90]s specimens, since Kevlar threads were found to be prone to breakage under cyclic loading. As a conclusion, while the static delamination resistance of laminated composites is improved by stitching, this does not automatically result in better fatigue performance for all lamination sequences. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is possible to mitigate this inherent limitation and enlarge the design space by using thin plies. This paper presents an experimental study, using a spread tow thin ply carbon-epoxy prepreg material with a cured ply thickness of 0.03 mm, which shows that highly non-linear stress-strain behaviour can be achieved with angle-ply laminates, whilst suppressing the damage mechanisms that normally cause their premature failure. Several angles between 15?? and 45?? are investigated in a [????5]s layup. It is shown that for all angles delaminations are suppressed, allowing considerable pseudo-ductile strains to develop. Significant fibre rotations take place, permitted by matrix plasticity, leading to a post-yield stiffening of the laminate, as the fibres reorient towards the direction of loading.",

The tensile strength and failure response of specimens with an open hole and a bolt-filled hole were evaluated. Both 100% bypass load (no bolt bearing load) and no bypass load (100% bolt bearing load) were considered during the experiments. X-radiographs were taken for specimens after pre-loading at different stress levels for the purpose of characterizing the failure modes and damage progression inside the composite. Experimental results showed that the bolt clamping force can significantly reduce the notch tensile strength of composite laminates which are prone to fiber-matrix splitting and delamination. A reduction in failure load of up to 20% was observed. Higher clamping pressure resulted in higher reductions of notch strength. However, for bolted joints which failed in a net-tension mode, clamping improved the joint strength regardless of the ply orientation.",

          "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced polymeric composites exhibit excellent mechanical properties over conventional engineering materials especially due to their great weight saving. Therefore, by considering the specific attributes of these materials, having a proper knowledge of dynamic behavior as well as static behavior of them is necessary. In order to study the effects of strain rate on the behavior of the materials, special testing machines are needed. Most of the researches in this field are focused on applying real loading and gripping boundary conditions on the testing specimens. This paper discusses the experimental study on the in-plane shear behavior of unidirectional glass fiber-reinforced polymeric composite under quasi-static and intermediate strain rate loading conditions. The symmetric and balanced ??45?? composite laminates are manufactured for characterization of the in-plane shear properties (modulus and strength) at various strain rates. Specimens are tested under uni-axial tensile loading using a servo-hydraulic testing apparatus. For performing the practical tests, jig and fixture are designed and manufactured. The performance of the test jig is evaluated and found to be adequate for composites testing. Dynamic tests results are compared with static tests carried out on specimens with identical geometry. The experimental results show that the mechanical shear properties are quite sensitive to strain rate. Under dynamic loading, the failure shear strength increased with increasing the strain rate but the shear modulus decreased. Based on the results obtained from the experiments, empirical functions for expressing the mechanical shear properties are proposed in terms of shear strain rate. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Damage characterization of composites is usually conducted through their acoustic behavior. As damage is being accumulated, this behavior is anticipated to change. Different damage mechanisms are active during loading. These mechanisms are acting in different time scales of the service life and are interdependent. Loading of cross-ply laminates leads to the accumulation of matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fiber rupture at the final stage of loading. The acoustic activity of damage may be correlated to the source damage mechanisms. Additionally, damage accumulation has been reported to strongly affect the wave propagation characteristics of the material. In the case of cross ply laminates, an increase of pulse velocity and transmission occurs as the top stiff layer becomes progressively isolated from the rest of the material due to matrix cracking and delaminations. As loading continues, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing an eventual decrease of transmission before the failure of the specimens. The present work aims to evaluate the efficiency of ultrasonics as a methodology for structural health monitoring. © 2012 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, London.",

          "abstract": "Demand for advanced engineering composites in the aerospace industry is increasing continuously. Lately, carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRPs) became one of the most important structural materials in the industry due to a combination of characteristics such as: excellent stiffness, high strength-to-weight ratio, and ease of manufacture according to application. In service, aerospace composite components and structures are exposed to various transient loads, some of which can propagate in them as cyclic impacts. A typical example is an effect of the wind gusts during flight. This type of loading is known as impact fatigue (IF); it is a repetition of low-energy impacts. Such loads can cause various types of damage in composites: fibre breaking, transverse matrix cracking, de-bonding between fibres and matrix and delamination resulting in reduction of residual stiffness and loss of functionality. Furthermore, this damage is often sub-surface, which reinforces the need for more regular inspection. The effects of IF are of major importance due its detrimental effect on the structural integrity of components that can be generated after relatively few impacts at low force levels compared to those in a standard fatigue regime. This study utilises an innovative testing system with the capability of subjecting specimens to a series of repetitive impacts. The primary subject of this paper is to assess the damaging effect of IF on the behaviour of drilled CFRP specimens, exposed to such loading. A detailed damage analysis is implemented utilising an X-ray micro computed tomography system. The main findings suggested that at early stages of life damage is governed by o degree splits along the length of the specimens resulting in a 20% reduction of stiffness. The final failure damage scenario indicated that transverse crasks in the 90 degree plies are the main reason for complete delamination which can be translated to a 50% stiffness reduction. © 2011 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

For the type of impact damage and laminate configuration investigated in this study the fatigue limit is found to be 60% CSAI (compression strength after impact) in constant-amplitude compression-compression loading, and 65% CSAI under the spectrum loading conditions. Furthermore, the results of spectrum loading tests suggest that the durability testing can be accelerated by omitting from the standardized test sequence load levels in which the stress range is less than 20% CSAI.",

One drawback of conventional composite materials containing only FRP plies is their susceptibility to suffer internal damage due to low-velocity impact while showing little evidence of damage on the surface. Research reported in Part 1, and its companion Part 2, evaluated the resistance of a specific type of FML, glass-reinforced aluminum (Glare), to low-velocity impact. The experiments, a review of previous impact tests, the test program carried out in this project, and its results are discussed. The work confirmed that some consequences of impact on Glare are similar to the damage modes found in FRP composites such as delaminations, fiber breakage, and, ultimately, penetration of the material. On the other hand, in contrast to FRP composites, impact dents are formed that would reveal the impact during visual component inspections. Additionally, it was determined that Glare-5-2/1 laminates had the highest relative impact resistance of those tested. Copyright Â© 2005 by the National Research Council Canada.",

The manufacturing process and service of the composite laminates frequently lead to delamination. Vibration analysis is an integral part of most engineering structures. In the present article we provide a relevant survey on the various analytical models and numerical analyses for the free vibration of delaminated composites. A basic understanding of the influence of the delamination on the natural frequencies and the mode shapes of composite laminates is presented. In addition, other factors affecting the vibration of the delaminated composites are discussed. Particular attention is given to composite laminates having piezoelectric sensors and actuators, and ones subjected to axial\nloadings.",

The simply supported specimen is with a central large-sized elliptical cutout and subjected to shearing load. In the numerical analysis, a damage model incorporating both advanced strain softening schemes and cross-coupling effect between the failure mechanisms is constructed for the damage simulation. Regularizations are implemented for coupling the damage variables to address the deficiencies of the existing model and access the real physical damage behavior of laminated composites. The strain invariant failure theory is employed for evaluation of delamination. To assess the objectivity of the present numerical model, the numerical predictions are compared with experimental data.

Ply cracks and delamination extended near the hole with an increasing number of cycles, and the reflection spectrum from the FBG sensor was distorted. Moreover, debonding growth of the FBG sensor was observed. This study then estimated laminate damage pattern from reflection spectra and investigated the influence of the sensor debonding on damage identification. The debonding length was estimated from the spectrum simulated with a given debonding length and was successfully identified only when an appropriate damage pattern was assumed. Moreover, greater debonding induced invalid damage-pattern estimates, even if the debonding length was given in the estimation. The damage identification for simulations and for experiments required half of the intact gage section. These estimates indicated that information on the damage pattern disappeared from the spectrum shape because of debonding. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Various influential factors associated with ply waviness, such as the waviness geometry, the off-axis angle, the extent of wavy region, and the waviness pattern, are incorporated in the multi-parameter model. Analytical results for the Young’s moduli, the shear moduli and the Poisson’s ratios of wavy fiber composite laminates are obtained and discussed for a specific range of fiber volume fractions and two different lay-ups. Negative Poisson’s ratios are found for unidirectional laminates nested wavy ply/plies.

A number of damage mechanisms induced in two sets of circular coupon specimens have shown to be of both local and global effects. It is demonstrated that damage force and incident kinetic energy (IKE) maps can be used to identify damage initiation. However, the use of IKE and damage area for assessing damage tolerance has limitations, in particular for thick laminates, so that the use of impact force can be an additional damage measure. It is found that delamination or multiple delamination degrading local flexural stiffness causes impacted panels to fail in compression with kink-band shear at a load level that is significantly lower than that of unimpacted panels. But when the impacted panels are completely delaminated, they can still retain 30% strengths for the glass-polyester and 20% strengths for the glass-phenolic laminates if they are under subsequent compressive loading.

Finite element models of the FMLs were created using the commercial software package Abaqus/Explicit, where the constitutive relationships and damage in the composite material were described through a user-defined subroutine. The composite was modelled as an orthotropically elastic material prior to damage initiation and the growth of subsequent damage was based on an instant failure rate-dependent model. The simulated deformation and failure modes in the FMLs were found to be in good agreement with published experimental data. For FMLs based on thin GFPP layers, a number of dynamic failure scenarios were captured, such as petalling, large tensile tearing and multiple debonding between the aluminium and GFPP layers. A high degree of correlation between simulated failure on the back face aluminium and the underlying GFPP damage modes was revealed. Finally, the transient behaviour of FML panels during blast loading was studied and discussed. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The fatigue-damage mechanisms of a unidirectional carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy has been studied under tension- tension loading. A ubiquitous form of damage was one or a few planar fiber breaks from which debonds or shear yield zones grew in the longitudinal direction during fatigue cycling. This leads to a change in stress profile of the neighboring fibers, and an increase in failure probability of these fibers. The breakage of fibers in the composite is controlled by the fiber strength distribution. The interaction between the fiber strength distribution and debond propagation leading to further fiber breakage was investigated by a numerical simulation. It was found that a wider distribution of fiber strength and a higher debond rate lead to more distributed damage and a higher fracture toughness. Implications to fatigue life behavior are discussed, with reference to constituent microstructure. (C) 2000 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have shown the severe limitations that have to be placed on machining forces when drilling composite laminates due to their propensity for delamination. Delamination, which consists of separation between the plys in a laminate, is due to the relatively poor strength of these materials in the thickness direction. In drilling, delamination is initiated when the drilling force exceeds a threshold value, particularly at the critical entry and exit locations of the drill bit. While abrasive machining results in damage-free holes in most composites, such processes are slow and expensive when compared to drilling with conventional twist drills. Here it is shown that the chisel edge in such drills is a major contributor to the thrust force that is the primary cause of delamination when drilling composite laminates. In this study, a series of drilling experiments were conducted on carbon fiber-reinforced composite laminates to determine quantitatively the effect of the chisel edge on the thrust force. In addition, tests were conducted to determine the effect of pre-drilling the laminate with a pilot hole. The results show a large reduction in the thrust force when a pilot hole is present which, in effect, removes the chisel edge contribution. An analytical model that incorporates the presence of a pilot hole is also described. The results from the thrust force-feed relationships show good agreement with experimentally determined values for the thrust force for a wide range of feeds for drilling tests conducted on laminates with and without pilot holes.",

In this peridynamic model three types of damages in composite laminate could be analyzed: fiber fracture, matrix fracture and delamination. The mesh independency was also examined for this approach. In the examples of laminate with unidirectional and multidirectional layup, the progressive damages and failure modes were successfully analyzed under a tensile load and had a good agreement with experiments.

The constitutive equation for the composite results from the combination of the constitutive equations of the laminae that, in turn, are obtained from the combination of fibers and matrix. The behavior of each component is simulated by a general elastoplastic anisotropic model. The combination rules obey to the microstructure of the composite. In order to calibrate the general model, the behavior of composites formed by laminae reinforced with unidirectional fibers is studied. Three-dimensional finite element models are used to study the distribution of stresses and strains inside the composite. These finite element models are useful to verify the hypotheses of the proposed composites theory, in a relatively simple way. Comparisons between elastic properties of laminae obtained with the finite elements model, with Mori-Tanaka method, with the model for composite studied and experimental results are included in the paper. Elastic properties of laminates with different stacking sequences and fibers orientations are also obtained. Additionally, application examples showing the non-linear response of laminae and laminates obtained with the calibrated model and comparisons with experimental results are presented. The results show that the calibrated model describes the behavior up to failure of composite laminates. The failure mode of the composite produced by the failure of one or more of its components can be identified. The calibrated model is also able to reproduce complex failure modes that change from the matrix to the fibers depending on the type of stress state. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Two methods were examined for the prediction of stress redistribution due to subcritical damage accumulation near open holes in composite laminates. A finite element analysis in conjunction with the method of material property degradation was performed to assess the accuracy of the fiber direction stress redistribution prediction due to formation of longitudinal splitting. A simple case of a unidirectional composite with an open hole was considered. The method was unable to accurately predict the fiber stress relaxation due to longitudinal splitting, which in the case of laminates with holes is of paramount importance for the accurate prediction of ultimate strength. Three-dimensional ply level modeling of discrete damage near an open hole in a quasi-isotropic composite laminate was subsequently considered. Normally the mesh configuration is dictated by the boundaries of the specimen, such as the presence of a hole, creating formidable difficulties to modeling matrix cracking, which is aligned with the fiber direction in a given ply. A mesh independent displacement discontinuity modeling method based on higher order shape functions was constructed for this purpose. The surface of the displacement jump associated with matrix cracking was defined in terms of the domain Heaviside function approximated by using higher order polynomial B-splines. Moir?? interferometry was used to determine the strain and displacement fields in the surface layers of a quasi-isotropic composite, previously prestressed beyond the damage initiation load. Good correlation between the experimental data and the stress redistribution predicted by the mesh independent damage modeling technique was observed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Fatigue damage in various forms of microcracking is examined. The transient nature of the nonlinear, monotonic stress- strain curve is investigated first, and subsequent property degradation and hysteresis loop changes are examined. Contrary to the behavior of certain metals and polymers, a cyclic stable state is never reached in general; cyclic softening is always observed in this class of materials. Owing to the random microstructure of the SMC material, the fatigue damage is viewed as being macroscopically homogeneous and uniform, and the damage growth is treated in a continuous sense. A parameter is then introduced to define the degree of the homogeneous damage. A power-law relationship among the rate of damage evolution, loading variables, and cyclic history is established. The homogeneous fatigue damage decreases rapidly with the loading cycle due to combined effects of rapid depletion of microcrack initiation sites and presence of various crack arrest mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Thin-ply composites are rapidly gaining interest in the composite industry, not only because of the larger design possibilities that they offer, but also because of positive size effects that have been shown to improve performance in various loading conditions [1]. In this work, carbon fiber-epoxy composites of different ply thicknesses (30-300g/m2 fiber areal weight) were produced from the same batch of Toray M40JB fiber and NorthTPT TP80ep matrix to study the influence of ply thickness on the ultimate strength and on the onset of damage in lamina, laminates and components. Uniaxial tension, open-hole compression and open-hole tensile fatigue tests on quasi isotropic [45??/90??/-45??/0??]ns laminates showed very significant improvements regarding the on-set of damage, and in some cases ultimate strength, when decreasing the ply thickness. These performance improvements are the result of major changes in the damage progression and failure modes of the laminates caused by a systematic delay or near suppression of transverse cracking and delamination growth in thin-ply composites. On the component level, thin-ply laminates enabled a marked improvement for bolted-joint bearing, especially in hot-wet conditions. Under impact, the 30??m thin ply laminate exhibited a quasi-brittle failure with extensive translaminar cracking while a ply thickness of 100??m was found as optimum to minimize the projected damage area. Ply thickness scaling of transverse and in-plane shear strength was identified based on classical laminate theory and unnotched tensile tests on quasi-isotropic specimens. The empirical scaling was found to follow a linear trend over a range of ply thicknesses from 30 to 250??m. Due to the near suppression of delamination, the strength of thin-ply composites could then be modeled more effectively than thick ply composites using classical laminate theory or standard multilayer shell modeling. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

A ply crack was generated at the center of the lowermost ply, and then a butterfly-shaped interlaminar delamination was propagated at the 90/0 ply interface. Based on these experimental observations, we present a numerical simulation of interlaminar damage propagation, using a cohesive zone model to address the energy-based criterion for damage propagation. This simulation can address the interlaminar delamination with high accuracy by locating a fine mesh near the damage process zone, while maintaining computational efficiency with the use of automatic mesh generation. The simulated results of interlaminar delamination agreed well with the experiment results. Moreover, we demonstrated that the proposed method reduces the computational cost of the simulation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The adequacy of a fracture criterion to represent the experimental data for the effect of voids on the flexure strength, tensile strength, and interlaminar shear strength of composite laminates is assessed. The experimental program investigates the effect of different pressures and dwell times on the critical void content. Laminates produced with carbon fiber/epoxy resin unidirectional prepreg have been produced with an intentionally high void content. Short beam shear, three-point flexure, and tensile testing are used for mechanical evaluation and the results correlate to void volume fraction and ultrasonic absorption coefficient. The ultrasonic absorption coefficient is measured for all the specimens and its variation is approximately linear with the void content, corroborating previous experimental results. The effects of these factors on the strength of the composite laminates are discussed in terms of the fracture parameters involved in the fracture criterion. The critical void content is estimated for each case both in terms of void content and ultrasonic attenuation.",

CNTs were employed not only for improving the mechanical performance of composite, but also for providing an innovative way for monitoring the damage accumulation during the loading of the laminate via the monitoring of the changes in the conductivity of the material. The CNT inclusion improved the transverse conductivity rendering the UD composite more electrically isotropic. Both plain and modified laminates were subjected to monotonic and cyclic tensile loading with simultaneous monitoring of the longitudinal resistance. The resistance change due to mechanical loading was more pronounced for the laminates with the modified matrices. As it was expected, the presence of the electrically conductive CNT network acted as a direct sensor of matrix related damage phenomena, which was complementary to changes related to failure of the reinforcing phase. This was not the case for the reference composite laminates where the monitored changes of the electrical conductivity mirrored the damage exclusively related to the reinforcing phase i.e., the carbon fibers.",

It is very difficult to carry out by using conventional methods. A unique opportunity was provided to real-time monitor the health status of composite structures by using embedded fiber optic sensors (FOSs). In this paper, the extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are real-time employed to simultaneously monitoring the cure process of CFRP composite laminates with and without damage. The results show that both embedded EFPI and FBG sensors could be used to monitor the cure progress of composite materials and detect the occurred damage on-line during the fabrication of composite structures. Furthermore, the NDE of smart composite laminates embedded both EFPI and FBG sensors are performed by using the three-point bending test. The experimental results present that the flexural strain of CFRP composite laminates with damage is more than that of CFRP laminates without damage under same load as we expected. Both EFPI and FBG sensors also show the excellent correlation during the cure monitoring and bending test. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Fiber characteristics and the influences of fiber type and loading rate on HDPE crystallization behavior and composite mechanical properties were investigated. Fiber length and aspect ratio distributions for all fibers followed a lognormal distribution after milling with two parameters defining the curve location (i.e., mean fiber length/aspect ratio) and shape (i.e., mean fiber length/aspect ratio distribution). For both VHDPE and RHDPE, rice straw fiber systems had comparable mechanical properties with those of wood composites. Increase in fiber loading led to increased moduli and decreased tensile and impact strength. Composite panels with rice husk had the smallest storage moduli, but their impact strength was comparable or better than that of other straw fibers. Very little difference in mechanical properties existed among leaf, stem, and whole straw fibers. The particular recycled HDPE resin and its composites had significantly better moduli and strength properties compared to the virgin HDPE systems due to additives used during initial processing. X-ray diffraction experiments showed that introducing fiber to HDPE matrix did not change characteristic peak position, but the fiber increased crystalline thickness of HDPE system. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed that VHDPE had significantly larger peak heat flow during cooling run than the RHDPE, indicating higher crystallization rates for VHDPE. The use of fiber in both resin systems led to the reduced peak heat flow rate. The study showed that rice straw fibers can work well with both VHDPE and RHDPE as reinforcing filler. Future work will deal with effect of coupling treatments of the straw fibers in single phase or commingled plastics composite systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In case of dynamic loading conditions, the strain-rate effects the change of the damage behavior of composite materials, as well as the behavior of the matrix. The enhanced micromechanical model which improves the in-plane shear behavior, is used for analyzing the rate-dependent behaviors of the fiber and matrix constituents.

Hence efficient computational models are required. The present study was conducted to efficiently predict ply level impact response of composite laminates. Static load-deflection based computational model was developed in the commercial software ABAQUS&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;. Eight, 16, and 24 ply laminates impacted by point, small, medium, and flat nose impactors were considered with emphasis on flat nose impacts. Loading areas under the impactor nose profiles were partitioned to investigate effects from variations in applied loading. Pre-assumed damage zones consisting of degraded material properties equivalent to the impactor nose profiles were inserted across thickness of the laminates to predict ply-by-ply damage. Impactor nose profiles and pre-assumed damage zones (size, type, and location) were correlated to the simulation produced deflection quantities to predict the ply level damage. Selected results were compared against the data available in the literature and also against the intra-simulation results and found in good agreement.",

First, a brief summary is presented for applications of small-diameter FBG sensors to damage monitoring in composite structures. Then, we propose a new damage detection system for quantitative evaluation of delamination length in CFRP laminates using Lamb wave sensing. In this system, a piezo-ceramic actuator generates Lamb waves in a CFRP laminate. After the waves propagate in the laminate, transmitted waves are received by an FBG sensor attached on or embedded in the laminate using a newly developed high-speed optical wavelength interrogation system. This system was applied to detect interlaminar delamination in CFRP cross-ply laminates. When the Lamb waves passed through the delamination, the amplitude decreased and a new wave mode appeared. These phenomena could be well simulated using a finite element analysis. From the changes in the amplitude ratio and the arrival time of the new mode depending on the delamination length, it was found that this system could evaluate the delamination length quantitatively. Furthermore, small-diameter FBG sensors were embedded in a double-lap type coupon specimen, and the debonding progress could be evaluated using the wavelet transform.",

          "abstract": "Recently, natural fiber-reinforced composites are becoming a viable alternative to synthetic fiber composites in many applications. Secondary processing in terms of hole making in composites is an almost unavoidable operation for facilitating the assembly operations. In the present experimental investigation, the drilling process of natural fiber-reinforced thermoplastic bio-composites has been evaluated in terms of the drilling forces. The cutting speed, feed rate and the drill point geometry have been taken as the input process parameters. Two types of drill geometries (solid and hollow in shape) have been used for drilling in the present work. The cutting mechanism of solid and hollow drill point geometry are substantially different which consequently affects the drilling forces and drilling-induced damage.",

          "abstract": "Thick glass fibre reinforced laminates are investigated under both single and repeat static loadings using a flat-ended indenter. It is found that the behaviour of these laminates is dominated by damage mechanisms such as delamination and fibre shear-out. A force-based analytical model is developed to predict the onset of delamination. Under single monotonic loading, the analytical model not only describes the elastic behaviour up to the occurrence of delamination and predicts the critical load level at which delamination occurs, but also describes the post-delamination behaviour with modified stiffnesses. It is observed that the increase of laminate thickness increases the load level of the incipient delamination and is proportional to that of laminate load-bearing capability. Under repeat loading, it is found that the indentation laws are dependent not only on materials but also geometry, and that delamination has no permanent affect on the indentation laws. It is noted that the ultimate static resistance of S-glass/phenolic laminates when normalized with reference to thickness are much more superior than that of E-glass/polyester laminates. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The initiation and growth of damage in composite materials are phenomena that precede the catastrophic failure event where a material sample or component fragments or separates into two pieces. During fatigue loading, the damage grows stably due to cyclic stressing and leads to a gradual deterioration of mechanical properties and ultimately to failure. For cross-ply laminates, the estimation is necessary of effective stress intensity factors or energy release rates, for statically loaded ply cracks in 90?? plies that are bridged by the uncracked 0?? plies, particularly when considering the early stages of property degradation. Such relations are used in conjunction with a fatigue crack growth law to predict the progressive development of damage during fatigue. For fatigue loading this paper justifies, on the basis of detailed physical modelling based on energy methods rather than empiricism, the use of the stress range intensity factor as the correlating parameter for fatigue crack growth data, rather than energy release rates or differences of energy release rate. Use is made of an accurate stress transfer model for multiple-ply cross-ply laminates to predict the dependence of energy release rates and stress intensity factors for long bridged ply cracks on the applied stress and ply crack separation. Two methods of analysis are considered. The first uses a method that can be extended to deal with small laminate defects where the energy release rate and stress intensity factor depend on the size of the defect, but the laminate is subject only to a uniaxial load. The second method applies to multi-axial loading, but assumes that the stress intensity factor or energy release rate is independent of the defect size. Both methods are, however, shown to lead to the same energy release rate and stress intensity factor for long ply cracks subject to uniaxial loading. The two methods also take full account of the effects of thermal residual stresses through the use of a crack closure concept. Simplifying assumptions are made when developing a model that predicts the degradation of most of the thermoelastic constants of a fatigue damaged cross-ply laminate as a function of the number of fatigue cycles. Such data are needed to predict the fatigue behaviour of structures having complex stress states using finite element analysis. Preliminary work carried out to validate the fatigue model, based on simplifying assumptions, has led to pessimistic predictions of performance that have the advantage that they can be exploited in the form of conservative design methods.

The model is developed for an individual lamina, and then assembled to describe the nonlinear behavior of the laminate. The model predicts the inelastic effects as reduction of stiffness and increments of damage and unrecoverable deformation. The model is defined using continuous damage mechanics coupled with classical thermodynamic theory. Unrecoverable deformations and damage are coupled by the concept of effective stress. New expressions of damage and unrecoverable deformation domains are presented so that the number of model parameters is small. Furthermore, model parameters are obtained from existing test data for unidirectional laminae, supplemented by cyclic shear stress-strain data. Comparison with lamina and laminate test data are presented to demonstrate the ability of the model to predict the observed behavior",

The interlaminar fracture toughness (ILFT) represented by mode-I critical strain energy release rate (GIc) for the initiation of delamination was measured using double cantilever beam tests. The specimens with pristine nanotubes and functionalized nanotubes showed a small effect on the ILFT. The specimens with P-SWCNTs showed stable crack growth and the potential for enhanced crack bridging along with slightly higher GIc than F-SWCNT specimens. Scanning electron microscopy images showed enhanced fiber--matrix interfacial bonding in the specimens with F-SWCNTs. However, large unstable crack propagation was observed in these F-SWCNT specimens from load--displacement curves and crack propagation videos.

The damage mechanisms and location of the damage in the woven laminates is deduced from comparison of dynamic results with the dynamic response from the cross-ply laminates containing well characterized damage.

Some observations are related to wave propagation effects. Part II reports a quantitative analysis of the experimental data.

The AE transients were recorded as functions of time by the use of broad-band AE transducers. In the experiments, it was observed that different types of cracks generated acoustic emission signals varying in amplitude, duration time and frequency content. It was also seen that the same type of crack produced signals with different characteristics depending on the layer in which the crack appeared and its orientation compared to the location of the transducer. The majority of signals from the tests could be divided into a few main groups. Typical signals and characteristics representing these groups are presented in the paper.

The effect of impactor shape on the impact response of composite laminates. Compos Struct 2005;67(2):139-48]. After impacting thin woven carbon/epoxy laminates using hemispherical, ogival and conical steel impactors all 12 mm in diameter using a drop weight test rig (Mitrevski et al., 2005), various post-impact analysis techniques have been employed, such as non-destructive inspection (NDI) and microscopy to assess the effect of impactor shape on the resulting damage. The blunter hemispherical impactor produced the largest damage area dominated by delamination. The rather sharp conical impactor produced the most fibre breakage which resulted in a localised damage area and the largest indentation/penetration depth. A significant reduction in tensile strength was found for all specimens. The specimens impacted by the hemispherical impactor at 4 J experienced a slightly higher residual tensile strength due to the barely visible impact damage (BVID) induced which was dominated by delamination. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Delaminations in composite laminates resulting from impact events may be accompanied by minimal indication of damage at the surface. As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5% in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Five of the panels were used as control while the remaining four were retrofitted with adhesively bonded 500 mm wide GFRP laminate strips on both faces, one in each direction parallel to the panel edges. The panels were subjected to blast loads generated by the detonation of either 22.4 kg or 33.4 kg ANFO explosive charge located at a 3-m standoff. Blast wave characteristics, including incident and reflected pressures and impulses, as well as panel central deflection and strain in steel and on concrete/FRP surfaces were measured. The post-blast damage and mode of failure of each panel was observed, and those panels that were not completely damaged by the blast were subsequently statically tested to find their residual strength. It was determined that overall the GFRP retrofitted panels performed better than the companion control panels while one retrofitted panel experienced severe damage and could not be tested statically after the blast. The latter finding is consistent with previous reports which have shown that at relatively close range the blast pressure due to nominally similar charges and standoff distance can vary significantly, thus producing different levels of damage. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The statistical aspect of fatigue properties in fiber-reinforced plastics is investigated. The P-S-N diagram was produced based upon the fatigue test results, which was conducted on the satin woven glass fabric/polyester laminate. The dependences of fatigue life and its dispersion on the applied stress level and fatigue frequency are discussed. The failure mode under fatigue loading mainly consisted of three kinds: the fiber breakage, matrix cracking and interlaminar delamination, which clearly depends upon the stress level, in other words, fatigue life region. The test results indicated that the wider scatter of the experimental data has been observed in the life range of 105-106 cycles. This characteristic can be well explained by the fact that there exist several dominant failure modes including delamination damage in this life region. The tension fatigue test results conducted on quasi-isotropic carbon/epoxy laminates, [0/??45/90]S, revealed that the dominant fatigue failure mode is a progressive delamination damage at -45/90 interlayer. The paper also discusses a concept for improving the fatigue resistance of a quasi-isotropic CFRP laminate as a result of suppressing the delamination damage. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Periodical maintenance NDT-based inspections are generally used for almost all complex technological structures today. The idea of using specific sensors integrated in the structure for structural real time monitoring (or health monitoring) is now in progress. Carbon-fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP) are increasingly used as structural parts, especially in the aircraft industry. This work deals with the possibility of detecting in-situ damage in CFRP by the use of DC or AC electrical property measurements. Monotonic tests under post-buckling bending conditions are being performed on cross ply [0/90]s and [90/0]s carbon/epoxy laminates. The monitoring of electrical resistance and capacitance changes, linked to the modifications of the conduction paths in the composite, and occurrence of voids during loading, allowed the detection of damage growth. It seems that DC electrical conduction allows to detect fibre failure, but AC measurements are more suitable for monitoring matrix cracks (delamination, fibre/matrix debonding or transverse cracks). ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The method was evaluated by ranking laminates for damage resistance using the proposed parameter and comparing the results with existing experimental and numerical results. The results were generally positive, as the damage resistance parameter had a high linear correlation with the experimentally measured or numerically predicted damage areas. Some limitations were noted with the method, including the inaccurate ranking of laminates containing plies stacked at angles greater than 60 °. With further research, the proposed damage resistance parameter should provide a viable alternative to the sophisticated and time-consuming methods currently available when making low-velocity impact damage predictions.",

Damage is assumed to initiate when one of Hashin’s failure criteria is satisfied, and its evolution is modeled by an empirical relation proposed by Matzenmiller, Lubliner and Taylor. The transient nonlinear problem is solved by the finite element method (FEM). Contributions of the work include considering damage in 3-D rather than plane stress deformations of a laminated structure and elasto-plastic deformations of the composite. This has been accomplished by developing a user defined subroutine and implementing it in the FE software ABAQUS. From strains supplied by ABAQUS the material subroutine uses a micro-mechanics approach based on the method of cells and values of material parameters of constituents to calculate average stresses in an FE, and checks for Hashin’s failure criteria. If damage has initiated in the material, the subroutine evaluates the damage developed, computes resulting stresses, and provides them to ABAQUS. The damage evolved at a material point is not allowed to decrease during unloading. The delamination failure mode is simulated by using the cohesive zone model available in ABAQUS. The computed time histories of the axial load acting on the impactor are found to agree well with the experimental ones available in the literature, and various damage and failure modes agree qualitatively with those observed in tests.",

Conventionally, impact characterization of composite materials is studied via nondestructive techniques such as ultrasonic C-scanning, infrared thermography, X-ray, and acoustography. None of these techniques, however, enable 3D microscale visualization of the damage at different layers of composite laminates. In this paper, a 3D microtomographic technique has been employed to visualize and compare impact damage modes in a set of thermoplastic laminates. The test samples were made of commingled polypropylene (PP) and glass fibers with two different architectures, including the plain woven and unidirectional. Impact testing using a drop-weight tower, followed by postimpact four-point flexural testing and nondestructive tomographic analysis demonstrated a close relationship between the type of fibre architecture and the induced impact damage mechanisms and their extensions.",

Experimental observations of damage evolution have also been carried out in T300/914 carbon/epoxy laminates, during thermal fatigue tests. The influence of temperature amplitude on damage is investigated throughout tests. Damage consists of matrix cracking in both 0?? and 90?? layers, followed by delamination along cracks at the 0??/90?? ply interfaces. It appears that, depending on the temperature amplitude, the damage evolution is either non-existent, rather slow, or very fast. It also appears that the predictions of the analysis are in good agreement with the experimental observations. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

A finite element analysis in conjunction with the method of material property degradation was performed to assess the accuracy of the fiber direction stress redistribution prediction due to formation of longitudinal splitting. A simple case of a unidirectional composite with an open hole was considered. The method was unable to accurately predict the fiber stress relaxation due to longitudinal splitting, which in the case of laminates with holes is of paramount importance for the accurate prediction of ultimate strength. Three-dimensional ply level modeling of discrete damage near an open hole in a quasi-isotropic composite laminate was subsequently considered. Normally the mesh configuration is dictated by the boundaries of the specimen, such as the presence of a hole, creating formidable difficulties to modeling matrix cracking, which is aligned with the fiber direction in a given ply. A mesh independent displacement discontinuity modeling method based on higher order shape functions was constructed for this purpose. The surface of the displacement jump associated with matrix cracking was defined in terms of the domain Heaviside function approximated by using higher order polynomial B-splines. Moir?? interferometry was used to determine the strain and displacement fields in the surface layers of a quasi-isotropic composite, previously prestressed beyond the damage initiation load. Good correlation between the experimental data and the stress redistribution predicted by the mesh independent damage modeling technique was observed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Low-velocity impact tests and residual tensile strength tests are performed using an instrumented drop-weight machine (Instron 9250HV) and static test machine (Instron 5569), respectively. The finite element (FE) software, ABAQUS/Explicit is employed to simulate low-velocity impact characteristics and predict residual tensile strength of carbon fiber composites laminates. These numerical investigations create a user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT) to enhance the damage simulation which includes Hashin and Yeh failure criteria. The impact contact force and the tensile strength are accurately estimated using the present method. Two different tensile damage modes after different impact energies are observed. The degradation of residual tensile strengths can be divided to three stages for different impact energies, and amplitudes of degradation are affected by stacking sequences.",

Fatigue damage in various forms of microcracking is examined. The transient nature of the nonlinear, monotonic stress- strain curve is investigated first, and subsequent property degradation and hysteresis loop changes are examined. Contrary to the behavior of certain metals and polymers, a cyclic stable state is never reached in general; cyclic softening is always observed in this class of materials. Owing to the random microstructure of the SMC material, the fatigue damage is viewed as being macroscopically homogeneous and uniform, and the damage growth is treated in a continuous sense. A parameter is then introduced to define the degree of the homogeneous damage. A power-law relationship among the rate of damage evolution, loading variables, and cyclic history is established. The homogeneous fatigue damage decreases rapidly with the loading cycle due to combined effects of rapid depletion of microcrack initiation sites and presence of various crack arrest mechanisms.",

Five-harness satin weave carbon/epoxy laminates were reinforced in the through-thickness direction with different volume fractions and sizes of fibrous composite pins. Microscopic examination of the laminates before flexural testing revealed that the pins caused considerable damage to the microstructure, including out-of-plane crimping, in-plane distortion and breakage of the fibres and the formation of resin-rich zones around each pin. The pins also caused swelling of the laminate that reduced the fibre volume content. Despite the damage, the pins did not affect the flexural modulus of the laminate. However, increasing the volume content or diameter of the pins caused a steady decline in the flexural strength and fatigue life, which appear to be governed by fiber rupture on the tensile side of the laminate. Property changes are discussed in terms of transitions in the dominant failure mechanisms due to the presence of pins. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

At this stage, low-velocity impact behavior of ceramics and fiber-reinforced composites is investigated. Impact test results revealed that impact loading is of dynamic nature and strength of the composite materials under dynamic loading increases considerably as a result of strain rate sensitivity, which makes them the right choice to be used in conjunction with ceramics in armor systems. The second stage examines the ballistic impact behavior and ballistic performance of the armor systems. The extent and pattern of impact damage related to projectile velocity are determined for the armor components and the armor itself.",

On the semi-log S-N curves obtained by fatigue tests, fatigue fracture is described by a straight line and the fatigue limit is not recognized clearly. In the on-axis fatigue tests, fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies develops in addition to ply-cracking damage in 90?? plies. The fiber-peeling damage was described by peeling-off of fiber bundles from the specimen surface after micro-scale damage of matrix resin and fiber-matrix interface. Most of the ply-cracking damage develops at an early stage of stress cycles, and slightly increases during fatigue, while the fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies initiates from the edges of 0?? plies and evolves in the whole area of laminates with an increase in stress cycles. The fatigue fracture seems to occur when the 0?? plies lose their load carrying capacity by the evolution of the fiber-peeling damage. In the off-axis fatigue tests, the fatigue fracture is caused by the initiation and evolution of ply-cracking damage and succeeding delamination. It is concluded that the fatigue strength is governed by the fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies under on-axis cyclic loading and by the ply-cracking damage and delamination under off-axis cyclic loading. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology undertaken consists of firstly, the numerical modeling of damage development in the FRP composite laminate. To capture the strain rate effects on the crush response, material models were formulated for each loading regime from experimental coupon tests under quasi-static and dynamic loads to retrieve input parameters for the material models. The second feature of the numerical methodology focuses on the implementation of innovative numerical triggers into the numerical models.

It was found that the AFC sensitivity degraded beyond strains of 0.20% and approached a minimum at 0.50% strain. The degradation in the AFC performance appears to be attributed to the dominating effect of PZT fiber fragmentation during testing, as opposed to depolarization.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a robust computational model for the response of composite laminates to high intensity transverse dynamic loading emanating from local impact by a projectile and distributed pressure pulse due to a blast. Delaminations are modeled using a cohesive type tie-break interface introduced between sublaminates while intralaminar damage mechanisms within the sublaminates are captured in a smeared manner using a strain-softening plastic-damage model. In the latter case, a nonlocal regularization scheme is used to address the spurious mesh dependency and mesh-orientation problems that occur with all local strain-softening type constitutive models. The results for the predicted damage patterns using the nonlocal approach are encouraging and qualitatively agree with the experimental observations. The predictive performance of the proposed numerical model is assessed through comparisons with available instrumented impact test results on a class of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates. Force-time histories and other derived cross-plots such as the force versus projectile displacement and progression of projectile energy loss as a function of time are compared with available experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the model in capturing the details of the dynamic response. Another case study involving the blast loading of CFRP composite laminates is used to further highlight the capability of the proposed model in simulating the global structural response of composite laminates subjected to distributed pressure pulses.

The evolution of dynamic modulus, hysteresis area, cyclic creep and temperature during fatigue tests were analyzed and discussed. Damage analyses by X-ray micro-computed tomography (??CT) technique on interrupted fatigue tests at several percentages of total fatigue life were performed to further understand the damage mechanisms and evolution during fatigue loading. It can be observed that experimental results related to the evolution of dynamic modulus, strain, temperature and energy dissipation are important and consistently complement each other for damage evaluation of PA66/GF30. During fatigue loading, diffuse damage occurs over the entire specimen though the damage does not necessarily exhibit the same level between different locations inside the specimen. The ??CT analysis of voids characteristics demonstrates that the damage continuously increases during fatigue loading. The damage is developed notably along fiber interface in the form of fiber/matrix interfacial debonding. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The characterisation of the damage state of composite structures is often performed using the acoustic behaviour of the composite system. This behaviour is expected to change significantly as the damage is accumulating in the composite. It is indisputable that different damage mechanisms are activated within the composite laminate during loading scenario. These “damage entities” are acting in different space and time scales within the service life of the structure and may be interdependent. It has been argued that different damage mechanisms attribute distinct acoustic behaviour to the composite system. Loading of cross-ply laminates in particular leads to the accumulation of distinct damage mechanisms, such as matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fibre rupture at the final stage of loading. As highlighted in this work, the acoustic emission activity is directly linked to the structural health state of the laminate. At the same time, significant changes on the wave propagation characteristics are reported and correlated to damage accumulation in the composite laminate. In the case of cross ply laminates, experimental tests and numerical simulations indicate that, typical to the presence of transverse cracking and/or delamination, is the increase of the pulse velocity and the transmission efficiency of a propagated ultrasonic wave, an indication that the intact longitudinal plies act as wave guides, as the transverse ply deteriorates. Further to transverse cracking and delamination, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing the catastrophic failure of the composite and is expected to be directly linked to the acoustic behaviour of the composite, as the stiffness loss results to the velocity decrease of the propagated wave. In view of the above, the scope of the current work is to assess the efficiency of acoustic emission and ultrasonic transmission as a combined methodology for the assessment of the introduced damage and furthermore as a structural health monitoring tool.",

          "abstract": "Asymmetric laminates can have a bistable response to loading, making them of particular interest for applications requiring a large deflection with relatively small and removable energy input. After nearly 30 years of research effort the effects of ply orientation and laminate geometry on the room-temperature shapes of such laminates are well understood and the temperature dependent deformations of laminates of arbitrary layup can be quantitatively predicted. With attention switching to the design of mechanisms incorporating bistable laminates for actuation there is an increasing importance placed on the accuracy and the sensitivity of modelling techniques to predict out-of-plane deflections. This paper presents the results of a novel experimental investigation to map the surface profiles of a series of arbitrary layup laminates. It is concluded that while existing modelling techniques are successful in accurately predicting room-temperature shapes, the sensitivity of solutions to imperfections is significant. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Although numbers of phenomenolog­ ical explanations have been made, this phenomenon has not yet been physically clear enough even today. In order to elucidate its key mechanism, our interest is here focused on the interlaminar crack extension from notch tips in cross-ply laminates subjected to mode-l loading. We find a stochastically expected upper bound of interlaminar crack ex­ tension due to the probabilistic breakage process of fibers in load-bearing laminae inside the region covered with interlaminar cracks. This upper bound, i.e., the critical length of interlaminar crack extension, is inherent to the laminate and corresponds to its notched strength. The well-known variation in apparent fracture strength of notched composite laminates with respect to the notch tip radius is clearly explained as the scale effect of this constant critical length in the different displacement distributions ahead of notch tips with different radii. ·",

It represents one contribution (called Part A of the Exercise) to the exercise, where predictions for laminate response and the failure behavior of various laminates, such as specific carbon- and glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy laminates under a broad range of loading conditions are made. The chapter describes a method for predicting the nonlinear stress/strain response and the failure behavior of composite laminates. Predictions are based on an incremental formulation of a well established three-dimensional laminated media analysis coupled with a progressive-ply failure methodology. Nonlinear lamina constitutive relations for the composites are represented using the Ramberg-Osgood equation. Piece-wise linear increments in laminate stress and strain are calculated and superimposed to formulate the overall effective nonlinear response. Individual ply stresses and strains are monitored to calculate instantaneous ply stiffnesses for the incremental solution and to establish ply failure levels. The progressive-ply failure approach allows for stress unloading in a ply and discrimination of the various potential modes of failure. The chapter presents laminate response and failure predictions for 14 different cases. The cases include prediction of the effective nonlinear stress vs. strain responses of laminates and initial and final ply failure envelope predictions under multiaxial loading.",

The approach taken has been described as synergistic damage mechanics (SDM) and has been previously illustrated for [0m / ± θn / 0m / 2]s laminates with cracks of equal density in + θ and - θ plies [Singh, C.V., Talreja, R., 2008.

The interaction between the ± θ-cracks and the 90°-cracks is analyzed in terms of the crack surface displacements using a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model and found to be significant only for crack orientations close to 90°. The stiffness degradation of the laminate with all cracking modes simultaneously present is formulated by continuum damage mechanics using a second order tensor characterization of damage. The elastic moduli changes predicted by the SDM procedure are validated by independent three-dimensional FE calculations. For a particular case of quasi-isotropic [0 / 90 / ∓ 45]s laminate, the elastic moduli predictions are evaluated against experimental data. Finally, a parametric study is performed to examine the effects of ply thickness changes on stiffness properties.",

          "abstract": "The initiation and growth of damage in composite materials are phenomena that precede the catastrophic failure event where a material sample or component fragments or separates into two pieces. During fatigue loading, the damage grows stably due to cyclic stressing and leads to a gradual deterioration of mechanical properties and ultimately to failure. For cross-ply laminates, the estimation is necessary of effective stress intensity factors or energy release rates, for statically loaded ply cracks in 90?? plies that are bridged by the uncracked 0?? plies, particularly when considering the early stages of property degradation. Such relations are used in conjunction with a fatigue crack growth law to predict the progressive development of damage during fatigue. For fatigue loading this paper justifies, on the basis of detailed physical modelling based on energy methods rather than empiricism, the use of the stress range intensity factor as the correlating parameter for fatigue crack growth data, rather than energy release rates or differences of energy release rate. Use is made of an accurate stress transfer model for multiple-ply cross-ply laminates to predict the dependence of energy release rates and stress intensity factors for long bridged ply cracks on the applied stress and ply crack separation. Two methods of analysis are considered. The first uses a method that can be extended to deal with small laminate defects where the energy release rate and stress intensity factor depend on the size of the defect, but the laminate is subject only to a uniaxial load. The second method applies to multi-axial loading, but assumes that the stress intensity factor or energy release rate is independent of the defect size. Both methods are, however, shown to lead to the same energy release rate and stress intensity factor for long ply cracks subject to uniaxial loading. The two methods also take full account of the effects of thermal residual stresses through the use of a crack closure concept. Simplifying assumptions are made when developing a model that predicts the degradation of most of the thermoelastic constants of a fatigue damaged cross-ply laminate as a function of the number of fatigue cycles. Such data are needed to predict the fatigue behaviour of structures having complex stress states using finite element analysis. Preliminary work carried out to validate the fatigue model, based on simplifying assumptions, has led to pessimistic predictions of performance that have the advantage that they can be exploited in the form of conservative design methods.

The AE transients were recorded as functions of time by the use of broad-band AE transducers. In the experiments, it was observed that different types of cracks generated acoustic emission signals varying in amplitude, duration time and frequency content. It was also seen that the same type of crack produced signals with different characteristics depending on the layer in which the crack appeared and its orientation compared to the location of the transducer. The majority of signals from the tests could be divided into a few main groups. Typical signals and characteristics representing these groups are presented in the paper.

This investigation is a continuation of the research conducted in [Mitrevski T, Marshall IH, Thomson R, Jones R, Whittingham B. The effect of impactor shape on the impact response of composite laminates. Compos Struct 2005;67(2):139-48]. After impacting thin woven carbon/epoxy laminates using hemispherical, ogival and conical steel impactors all 12 mm in diameter using a drop weight test rig (Mitrevski et al., 2005), various post-impact analysis techniques have been employed, such as non-destructive inspection (NDI) and microscopy to assess the effect of impactor shape on the resulting damage. The blunter hemispherical impactor produced the largest damage area dominated by delamination. The rather sharp conical impactor produced the most fibre breakage which resulted in a localised damage area and the largest indentation/penetration depth. A significant reduction in tensile strength was found for all specimens. The specimens impacted by the hemispherical impactor at 4 J experienced a slightly higher residual tensile strength due to the barely visible impact damage (BVID) induced which was dominated by delamination. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Delaminations in composite laminates resulting from impact events may be accompanied by minimal indication of damage at the surface. As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5% in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In order to examine the stacking sequence effect, five different θ fiber directions are chosen as 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75. Three different plate thicknesses as 2.9 mm, 5.8 mm, and 8.7 mm are also selected to survey the thickness effect on impact behaviour of glass/epoxy composite plates. The overlapped delamination area is obtained for composite plates with different stacking sequences and different thicknesses. A transient finite element code 3DIMPACT is used for numerical analyses. In this code an eight-point brick element and the direct Gauss quadrature integration scheme are used through the element thickness to account for the change in material properties from layer to layer. The Newmark scheme is also adopted to perform time integration step by step. In addition, a contact law incorporated with the Newton-Raphson method is applied to calculate the contact force during impact. Numerical results are compared with the experimental study and it has been seen that they are in good agreement with the experimental results.",

Eight 1000 ?? 1000 ?? 70 mm panels were made of 40 MPa concrete and reinforced with top and bottom steel meshes. Five of the panels were used as control while the remaining four were retrofitted with adhesively bonded 500 mm wide GFRP laminate strips on both faces, one in each direction parallel to the panel edges. The panels were subjected to blast loads generated by the detonation of either 22.4 kg or 33.4 kg ANFO explosive charge located at a 3-m standoff. Blast wave characteristics, including incident and reflected pressures and impulses, as well as panel central deflection and strain in steel and on concrete/FRP surfaces were measured. The post-blast damage and mode of failure of each panel was observed, and those panels that were not completely damaged by the blast were subsequently statically tested to find their residual strength. It was determined that overall the GFRP retrofitted panels performed better than the companion control panels while one retrofitted panel experienced severe damage and could not be tested statically after the blast. The latter finding is consistent with previous reports which have shown that at relatively close range the blast pressure due to nominally similar charges and standoff distance can vary significantly, thus producing different levels of damage. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The FMLs absorbed significant energy in plastic deformation, tearing the metal layers and fiber fracture, and offered a superior impact resistance to the plain composite on which the FMLs were based. The perforation data were normalized by the areal density of the target and the superiority of the metal—composite hybrids remained in evidence. Increasing the target size, the plate thickness, and the indentor diameter resulted in an increase in the energy required to perforate the target.

The P-S-N diagram was produced based upon the fatigue test results, which was conducted on the satin woven glass fabric/polyester laminate. The dependences of fatigue life and its dispersion on the applied stress level and fatigue frequency are discussed. The failure mode under fatigue loading mainly consisted of three kinds: the fiber breakage, matrix cracking and interlaminar delamination, which clearly depends upon the stress level, in other words, fatigue life region. The test results indicated that the wider scatter of the experimental data has been observed in the life range of 105-106 cycles. This characteristic can be well explained by the fact that there exist several dominant failure modes including delamination damage in this life region. The tension fatigue test results conducted on quasi-isotropic carbon/epoxy laminates, [0/??45/90]S, revealed that the dominant fatigue failure mode is a progressive delamination damage at -45/90 interlayer. The paper also discusses a concept for improving the fatigue resistance of a quasi-isotropic CFRP laminate as a result of suppressing the delamination damage. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea of using specific sensors integrated in the structure for structural real time monitoring (or health monitoring) is now in progress. Carbon-fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP) are increasingly used as structural parts, especially in the aircraft industry. This work deals with the possibility of detecting in-situ damage in CFRP by the use of DC or AC electrical property measurements. Monotonic tests under post-buckling bending conditions are being performed on cross ply [0/90]s and [90/0]s carbon/epoxy laminates. The monitoring of electrical resistance and capacitance changes, linked to the modifications of the conduction paths in the composite, and occurrence of voids during loading, allowed the detection of damage growth. It seems that DC electrical conduction allows to detect fibre failure, but AC measurements are more suitable for monitoring matrix cracks (delamination, fibre/matrix debonding or transverse cracks). ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Some limitations were noted with the method, including the inaccurate ranking of laminates containing plies stacked at angles greater than 60 °. With further research, the proposed damage resistance parameter should provide a viable alternative to the sophisticated and time-consuming methods currently available when making low-velocity impact damage predictions.",

Damage is assumed to initiate when one of Hashin’s failure criteria is satisfied, and its evolution is modeled by an empirical relation proposed by Matzenmiller, Lubliner and Taylor. The transient nonlinear problem is solved by the finite element method (FEM). Contributions of the work include considering damage in 3-D rather than plane stress deformations of a laminated structure and elasto-plastic deformations of the composite. This has been accomplished by developing a user defined subroutine and implementing it in the FE software ABAQUS. From strains supplied by ABAQUS the material subroutine uses a micro-mechanics approach based on the method of cells and values of material parameters of constituents to calculate average stresses in an FE, and checks for Hashin’s failure criteria. If damage has initiated in the material, the subroutine evaluates the damage developed, computes resulting stresses, and provides them to ABAQUS. The damage evolved at a material point is not allowed to decrease during unloading. The delamination failure mode is simulated by using the cohesive zone model available in ABAQUS. The computed time histories of the axial load acting on the impactor are found to agree well with the experimental ones available in the literature, and various damage and failure modes agree qualitatively with those observed in tests.",

Experimental observations of damage evolution have also been carried out in T300/914 carbon/epoxy laminates, during thermal fatigue tests. The influence of temperature amplitude on damage is investigated throughout tests. Damage consists of matrix cracking in both 0?? and 90?? layers, followed by delamination along cracks at the 0??/90?? ply interfaces. It appears that, depending on the temperature amplitude, the damage evolution is either non-existent, rather slow, or very fast. It also appears that the predictions of the analysis are in good agreement with the experimental observations. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

A damaged exponential traction-displacement jump relationship is proposed for the cohesive model and an exponential damage evolution law on the evolvement of displacement jump is proposed to describe the irreversible delamination crack propagation. The implementation of cohesive model uses zero-thickness cohesive element and middle-plane isoparametric interpolation technique. The mesh size effect is solved by regulating the delamination fracture toughness by the cohesive length, and the numerical convergence problem for the snap instability is addressed by viscous regularization. Four representative delamination cases of composite laminates are used to validate the proposed cohesive model: (a) double cantilever beam (mode-I), (b) end notch flexure (mode-II), (c) mixed-mode bending fracture, and (d) fixed ratio mixed mode. The effects of the cohesive strengths and mesh sizes on the global load-displacement response for four cases are studied. In addition, the numerical results using proposed cohesive model are also compared with the results obtained by the virtual crack closure technique and other existing cohesive models. The proposed cohesive model is demonstrated to predict the mixed-mode delamination response of composite laminates accurately and effectively. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

MWCNTs with varied surface conditions were prepared by oxidization or esterification, and then dispersed into a DGEBA epoxy system. The dispersion of the MWCNTs in the epoxy was improved by surface modification, resulting in improved composite mechanical properties as well. Significant increases in elastic modulus and strength were observed for epoxies with functionalized MWCNTs, especially for esterified species. When MWCNT - filled epoxies were used as matrices for basalt fiber/epoxy laminates, however, the reinforcement effects of MWCNTs on the composite elastic modulus exceeded micromechanics based semi-empirical predictions and were independent of surface functionalization. SEM morphological observations and the results of the micromechanical model revealed that nanotube re-distribution and orientation during processing was responsible for the enhancement of fiber-dominated mechanical properties.

Foremost among the differences is the characteristic damage state. [90m/0n]s laminates form antisymmetric or staggered microcracks while [0n/90m]s laminates form symmetric microcracks. To explain observed differences, this paper presents a variational mechanics analysis of the stresses and the energy release rate in a [[90m/0n]s laminate having staggered microcracks. The new analysis and a previous analysis of [0m/90n]s laminates are used to assess the effect of laminate structure on the mechanical properties and failure properties of cross-ply laminates. The findings are as follows. (1) A given level of microcracking damage causes a greater amount of degradation in mechanical properties in [[90m/0n]s laminates than in the corresponding [0n/90m]s laminates. (2) Although [[90m/0n]s laminates will initiate microcracks at lower loads, the corresponding [0n/90m]s laminates will develop more microcracks after continued loading. (3) A bending effect present in [90m/0n]s laminates but not in [0n/90m]s laminates promotes mode I delamination in [90m/0n]s laminates. ?? 1992.",

It is shown how these models associated with the statistical description of strength or energy released in the 90° plies make it possible to describe the development of transverse cracking in monotonic or fatigue loading. According to the nature of cross-ply laminates, transverse cracking is not, however, sufficient for describing the development of transverse cracks in 90° plies in the case of monotonic loading.

Guidelines to improve the impact damage resistance are proposed based on the results of the study.",

          "abstract": "Damage mechanisms and accumulation, and associated stiffness and residual strength reductions were studied in cross-ply graphite/epoxy laminates under cyclic tensile loading. Stress-life data were fitted by a two-parameter wearout model and by a second-degree polynomial on a log-log scale. The fatigue sensitivity is highest for the unidirectional laminates and it decreases for the crossply laminates with increasing number of contiguous 90° plies. Five different damage mechanisms were observed: transverse matrix cracking, dispersed longitudinal cracking, localized longitudinal cracking, delaminations along transverse cracks, and local delaminations at the intersection of longitudinal and transverse cracks. Failure patterns vary with cyclic stress level and number of cycles to failure. Under monotonie loading, failure is brittle-like and concentrated. At high stress amplitudes and short fatigue lives failure results from few localized flaws, whereas at lower stress amplitudes and longer fatigue lives failure results from more dispersed flaws. The residual modulus shows a sharp reduction initially, followed by a more gradual decrease up to failure. The residual strength showed a sharp reduction initially, followed by a plateau or even some increase in the middle part of the fatigue life, and a rapid decrease in the last part of the fatigue life. A tentative cumulative damage model is proposed based on residual strength and the concept of equal damage curves. © 1986.",

          "abstract": "Delamination was known to be one of the most important damage modes in composite laminates subjected to impact loading. In an effort to further understand the impact response of composite laminates, various degrees of impact ranging from subperforation to perforation were introduced to glass/epoxy laminates through an instrumented drop-weight impactor. In addition, composite laminates of various in-plane dimensions and thicknesses were examined for in-plane dimensional and thickness effects, respectively. Experimental results showed that in-plane dimensional effect was not as significant as thickness effect. The impacted composite laminates were then subjected to compression after impact (CAI) tests for characterizations of residual mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that perforation was the most important damage stage in composite laminates subjected to impact loading since impact characteristics (peak force, contact duration and absorbed energy) and mechanical properties degradation (residual compressive maximum force and residual compressive absorbed energy) of composite laminates became stable once perforation took place. However, it was also found that delamination played a very important role in the characterizations of mechanical properties degradation. Since the impact response of composite laminates is due to plate bending to some extent, bending analysis was used to explain the greater influence of thickness effect to in-plane dimensional effect. It was also found that bending analysis was feasible for interpretation of delamination in mechanical properties degradation.",

The uniweave textile was formed by weaving dry carbon-fiber tows with fiberglass fill tows. The content of fiberglass fill tows was 2.5% by weight. The plain woven laminates were manufactured using resin infusion molding and the uniweave laminates by resin transfer molding. Kevlar and glass yarns of various yarn numbers were used for stitching. Static Indentation-Flexure, Compression-After-Impact, Double Cantilever Beam and End-Notched Flexure tests were conducted. Stitching did not have any effect on the onset of impact damage. However, stitching leads to significant improvement (25-40%) in impact damage tolerance as measured by CAI strength and impact damage area. Mode I fracture toughness as characterized by critical strain energy release rate (G,Ic) was found to increase by at least an order higher (15-30 times) than the unstitched laminates. Mode II fracture toughness (GIIc) increased by 5-15 times over the unstitched laminates. New methods to estimate the Mode II critical strain energy release rate in the stitched laminates are presented. The stitched textile advanced composites are considered potentially superior to prepregs for high-volume, low-cost and high-performance structural materials.",

For fabrication of stitched laminates, a 3-cord Kevlar thread was used to stitch the fabric preform in lock stitch fashion in an orthogonal grid of size 12.7 and 25.4 mm with 6 mm stitch spacing. Unstitched laminates used in the study were made of 7, 17 and 37 layers whereas the stitched laminates were made of 7 and 17 layers.

Results of the study indicate that the damage was well contained within the stitch grid incase of stitched laminates. However, ballistic limit was higher for the unstitched laminates.

However, the thickness was an important influencing factor. Nearly 10 C temperature difference was found in 22.5 mm thick laminates. Through analyzing the physical mechanisms during microwave curing, the temperature difference decreased when the heat-loss in surface laminates was reduced and the absorption of microwave energy in the center laminates was improved. The maximum temperature difference of the samples formed using the modified microwave curing technologies in this research could be reduced by 79% to 2.1 C.

Effective-time theory has been used to characterize the physical aging behavior of each linear viscoelastic lamina. In accordance with experimental findings, the aging behavior of each lamina is allowed to differ in the shear and transverse directions. The mechanical loading is restricted to the linear range, which decouples the aging and load behavior. A recursive algorithm has been used to solve the hereditary convolution integral that governs the response of each ply. Classical thin-laminate theory is then used to assemble the individual ply response equations and determine the overall laminate response to general in-plane force and moment loading. The method automatically recovers the ply-level stresses and strains, which are often critical to strength and durability predictions. The model can use either lamina compliance or modulus properties as its basis. Several illustrative examples of long-term laminate response to variable loading are presented and the impact of physical aging is explored. It is shown that for multidirectional laminates, the stiffness of the lamina in the fiber directions can allow simplifications of the model.",

The stroke rates ranged from 0.0167 mm/s (slow rate of loading) to 36 mm/s (fast rate of loading). This induced a strain rate in the CFRP of 2.96 με/s (slow rate) to 6,930 με/s (fast rate).

The rapidly loaded beams showed an increase of approximately 5% in capacity, stiffness, and energy absorption. Ductility and the mode of failure were not directly affected by the change in loading rate. Precycled beams performed similarly to the beams loaded monotonically to failure but showed a 10% increase in service stiffness and a 10% loss in energy absorption.

          "abstract": "Interference strengthening technology is a common method of improving the fatigue life of metal assemblies, and is particularly used to prolong service life of metal structures. Composite materials have lower interlaminar strength and lower stretch ratio making it difficult to implement interference-fit joining, especially interference-fit riveting. The primary difficulty is controlling the interference to prevent damaging to the composite structure. The expansion of the rivet shaft by conventional riveting techniques is non-uniform and easy to damage the composite structure. Hence, interference-fit riveting is not recommended in composite structures. However, experimental results have shown that interference strengthening technology can be effectual in composite structures. The paper describes an electromagnetic riveting (EMR) technique which can create a well-distributed shaft expansion, and can be used to conduct interference-fit riveting in composites structures. This paper gives out that using an especial washer and appropriate clearance between shaft and aperture wall can restrict shaft expansion and prevent damaging to composites, and also studies the configuration of the washer and the clearance of riveting composite laminates. The paper also reports on an investigation involving a comparison of shaft expansion between hydraulic squeeze riveting and EMR. The experiments show that EMR technique can achieve an interference-fit riveting in fiber composite structures. ?? 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.",

The wavelet transform (WT) and short time fourier transform (STFT) are used to decompose the piezoelectric sensor signals in this study. Test results show that the particular waveform of sensor signals implying the damage initiation and propagation are detected above the damage initiation impact energy. It is found that both PZT and PVDF sensors can be used to detect the impact damage.",

A recently developed constant amplitude analytical prediction model for fiber metal laminates has been extended to predict fatigue crack growth under variable amplitude loading using a linear damage accumulation rule. The modified model has been compared with crack growth tests on fiber metal laminates center-cracked tension specimen. In the end, it is discussed to what extent or under which conditions the linear damage accumulation predictions are sufficiently accurate for fiber metal laminates structures.",

Polished. thin sections removed from plain glass fiber/nylon composites and their corresponding fiber-metal laminates indicated that the prevailing microstructure was strongly. dependent on the rate of cooling from the melt. Mode I and Mode 11 interlaminar fracture tests on the plain glass fiber reinforced nylon laminates indicated that the values of G(Ic) and G(IIc) averaged approximately 1100 J/m(2) and 3700 J/m(2) respectively at all cooling rates. The degree of adhesion between the aluminum alloy and composite substrates was investigated using the single cantilever beam geometry. Here, the measured values of G, were. similar in magnitude to the Mode I interlaminar fracture energy of the composite, tending to increase slightly with increasing cooling rate. The tensile and flexural fracture properties of the plain composites and the fiber metal laminates were found to increase by between 10% and 20% as the cooling rate was increased by two orders of magnitude. This effect was attributed to over-aging of the aluminum alloy plies at elevated temperature during cooling. Finally, fiber metal laminates based on glass fiber/nylon composites were shown to exhibit an excellent resistance to low velocity impact loading. Damage, in the form of delamination, fiber fracture, matrix cracking in the composite plies, and plastic deformation and fracture in the aluminum layers, was observed under localized impact loading. Here, the fast-cooled fiber metal laminates offered superior post-impact mechanical properties at low and intermediate impact energies, yet very similar results under high impact energies.",

          "abstract": "Indentation damage to a carbon fiber silicon carbide composite (C/SiC) was introduced and then investigated using a step-loading method to understand the impact mechanism. Damages at different indentation energies were characterized by thermography, computed tomography, and microscopy. The indentation energy effects on the residual compressive and tensile strengths were compared. The indentation process indicates that below 0.96 J, the linear elastic behavior and the extensively cracking in the SiC matrix mainly take place in the C/SiC composite, above which it turns into the load-bearing, debonding, breaking and pulling out of the fibers. The C/SiC composites thus have dual damage resistances to the indentation loading, which are mean 1544.5 N from the matrix and 1839.8 N from the fibers respectively. It is evaluated that the fibers mainly absorbed more than 70% of the indentation energy, and the matrix, approximately 30%. Visible indentation damage is identified to initiate from around 0.48 J, behaving as the compressive shear failure of the matrix in the front side, and the tensile breaking of the fibers in the back side. Delaminlation occurs always along the interfaces of the compressive and tensile stress states, resulting accordingly in much larger real damage areas than the apparent ones. With increasing indentation energies, the decreasing rate of the compressive strength is nearly four times higher than that of the tensile ones, revealing that the former is more sensitive to the indentation damage than the latter. The indentation-failed composites still retain 77% residual compressive strength (212.5 MPa) and 89% residual tensile strength (169.5 MPa), respectively. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Only the contour of the entire damage area could be obtained using ultrasonic C-scan, whereas more details of the damage were provided through the mechanical-sectioning technique. The impact properties of FMLs were affected by laminate stacking sequence. The first severe failure induced by low-velocity impact occurred as debonding between aluminum and the adjacent fiber-epoxy layer at the nonimpact side. It was followed by a visible crack in the outer aluminum layer at the nonimpact face. GLARE 5 made of unidirectional fibers had the least impact resistance; followed by cross-ply and angle-ply configurations; while the quasi-isotropic lay-up showed the best in resistance to impact. By introducing circular, rather than square, geometry as the outer perimeter of the specimens, the damage patterns as well as impact behaviors changed due to the relative anisotropy of the specimen with respect to the specimen clamping.",

Determination of impact response of composite materials provides the engineer and the manufacturer with critical knowledge to understand the failure criteria, initiation of the first failure and damage growth through the laminates. This study covers the investigation of impact damage growth and determination of Hertzian failure and maximum force thresholds in three different types of composites. Unidirectional E-Glass, woven E-Glass and woven Aramid composite samples with dimensions of 100 × 100 mm are subjected to low velocity impact with an instrumented impact test system. Rebound, on-set of perforation and perforation limits of composites are found out. Also, energy profile diagrams of both unidirectional and plain weave E-Glass composites are obtained. According to test results, woven composites are found to be superior to unidirectional composites in the protection limit of low velocity impact. It is also observed that damage growth in woven composites is restricted within a smaller area. Impact tests conclude that strength of the composite materials under dynamic loading increases considerably compared to static loading case as a result of strain rate sensitivity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In terms of energythe TTR fiber pull-out can be accompanied bysignificant amount of energydissipation due to the frictional work at interface; this process absorbs part of the energythat would otherwise be placed at the delamination front of the structure. The basic objective of this research project was to develop an efficient and accurate finite-element-based numerical tool to simulate the spontaneous propagation of a single TTR pull-out under quasi-static conditions and in the presence of frictional contact between the fiber/ matrix interface. The pull-out phenomenon was studied assuming a constant friction coefficient at the interface along the TTR axial direction and using improved contact-elements to solve the frictional contact problem. Load/displacement bridging curves of the fiber pull-out process, which includes elastic deformation with a fully/partially bonded interface plus frictional sliding, were calculated. Moreover, the effect of friction model was also investigated. Numerical results were validated byexperimental observations of debonding and frictional sliding of a fiber in steady-state pull-out tests under pure Mode I loading conditions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "In recent years, optical fibers have received attention as sensors for the purpose of in-service health monitoring in composite materials. Advantages of optical fiber sensors over conventional sensing methods are well-known and include resistance to corrosion and fatigue, similarity of their material properties to the reinforcing fibers, small, flexible and lightweight nature, immunity to electromagnetic interference and high response bandwidth. These features enable their embedding into composite structures and access locations where other sensing methods cannot easily probe. This paper evaluates the feasibili ty of real-time monitoring of indentation damage in composite laminates from indentation loading using the embedded intensity-based optical fiber sensors. An optical fiber sensing system, which relies solely on monitoring light intensity for providing indication of the composite structural health, offers simplicity in design and cost-effectiveness. For this, aramid/ polyvinylbutyral (PVB) laminates with embedded optical fibers were fabricated. Three configurations of woven composites were tested, namely, aramid/PVB, metal/PVB and aramid/metal/PVB. Several stacking sequences of aramid and metallic woven layers were used for investigations. Initiation of damage and fracture during testing was detected by observation of the intensity drop of light signal transmitted through optical fiber.",

Differences in adhesive bonding were achieved by using two different aluminum surface treatments, one with a standard P2-Etch procedure and another with a modified FPL-Etch procedure with the subsequent application of a silane coupling agent. Double-cantilever beam (DCB) tests were conducted to measure the interfacial fracture energy, and an increase in interfacial fracture toughness by up to six times was achieved by using the latter method. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the failure behavior and fracture mechanisms of the CFRMLs. No clear differences were found in laminate mechanical properties such as tensile strength and Young’s modulus. A reduction of 10% in the relative value for the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was observed for the laminate with poor interfacial adhesion associated with the P2-Etch method, in both three- and five-point bend tests. However, the residual strength of the notched CFRMLs is, in general, almost independent of the adhesion status between aluminum sheets and composite prepreg, although a slight increase in residual strength for laminates with weak interfacial adhesion was observed in the presence of small holes, because of the difference in delamination growth.",

Matrix cracking is modeled at the laminate level and debonding/delamination and fiber breakage at the lamina level and included in the formulation by adjusting the A, B and D matrices for composite laminates. The beam analysis is used to investigate the effect of damage on the various properties of thin walled composite beams such as out-of-plane stiffness, in-plane stiffness and torsion stiffness and deflections such as bending slopes and twist under an applied load. A two-cell airfoil section with [0/??45/90]s family of laminates having stiffness properties equivalent to a stiff in-plane hingeless rotor blade is considered. It is found that the bending and torsion stiffness loss due to matrix cracking is about 6-12% and 25-30%, respectively, and due to debonding/delamination is further 6-8% and 40-45%, respectively. Most of the bending stiffness loss is observed in the fiber breakage damage mode. It is also observed that the combination of the static tip bending and torsion response can be used to predict length of the damaged part of the thin walled composite beams, damage location and damage level. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a technique expands the design space of the laminate, and the ability to tailor local laminate properties may provide a means, for example, to mitigate stress concentrations that arise in places such as along free edges of the laminate. Preliminary fabrication of tiled laminates produced material with an elastic modulus that is nearly equal to that of continuously reinforced laminates; however, the strength of these first specimens was significantly reduced. Finite element analyses were then performed to characterize the effects of features unique to tiled composite laminates, such as the existence of resin-rich tile-to-tile interfaces, and to explore the effects of relative arrangement of tiles through the thickness of the laminate. This led to a novel composite joint geometry as well as recommendations to minimize strength reduction. Strength retention of laminates fabricated using the new design guidelines was experimentally found to exceed 92% in comparison with the traditional analogs. Finally, we discuss the potential application of composite tiling for the suppression of free-edge delamination.",

The laminates strength and damage mechanisms obtained from both experimental and finite elements analysis are presented for several laminates lay-up configurations. Observations on the performed experiments show matrix crack initiation and propagation in the skin and near the flange tip, causing the flange to almost fully debounded from the skin in some cases, interlaminar debounding and fiber breakage up to the failure of the components. The finite elements analysis is also show that the matrix cracks are initiated in the first skin layer for most of the cases. With increasing the applied load the matrix cracks are propagated through the thickness to reach the next layer and causes delamination between the two layers. With increasing the applied load this delamination is propagated up to the occurrence of unstable delamination growth or the first fiber breakage known as the final failure of the component.

To this direction, AE is a powerful non destructive technique for real time monitoring of damage development in materials and structures which has been used successfully for the identification of damage mechanisms in composite structures under quasi static and dynamic-cycle loading. In this present work, pure resin plate and GFRP composite laminates with stacking sequence of [0(0)](6), are fabricated using Hand lay-up method. During the layup a Teflon tape of width 45 mm is kept in the mid plane of the laminate which serves as an initiator for delamination during loading. As per ASTM STD D5528 01 DCB (Double Cantilever Beam) specimens are cut out from the laminates and are subjected to tensile test in the transverse direction along with acoustic emission monitoring. While loading, Markings are made on the sides of the specimen to track the crack front using a magnifying lens. Parametric analysis is performed on the AE data obtained during crack propagation to discriminate the failure modes. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) enabled the calculation of frequency content of each damage mechanism. Further STFFT analysis is performed on a portion of the waveforms representing the dominant frequency content pertaining to each damage mechanism.",

For matrix failure under transverse compression, the fracture plane is calculated by maximizing the Mohr- Coulomb effective stresses. A criterion for fiber kinking is obtained by calculating the fiber misalignment under load, and applying the matrix failure criterion in the coordinate frame of the misalignment. The criteria are applied to a few examples to predict failure load envelopes and to predict the failure mode for each region of the envelope.

          "abstract": "The objective of this work is the characterization and the assessment of the damage in CFRP composite laminates with different stacking sequences subjected to low velocity impact and flexural loading. Charpy impact test and three-point bending test were used in order to obtained the impact response and flexural behavior of different laminates. An experimental test series was carried out to determine impact energy absorption, flexural strength and stiffness and failure mechanisms of composite laminates made from M21E/IMA, an unidirectional prepreg used in Airbus A350 XWB primary structures. It is important to note that both elastic moduli and strength in the principal material directions are different under tension and compression. The flexural modulus is expected to have an intermediate value between the tensile and compression moduli. We analyze the effect of this type of multimodulus materials [1-3] in order to evaluate the influence of the geometry of the specimen on the failure modes (shear or flexural failure modes) observed in the three-point bending test and compare the results with tensile and compression behavior.Two main lay-up configurations have been analyzed: Unidirectional laminates [0]12, [90]12, [45]12 and multidirectional laminates (cross-ply [0/90]3s, angle-ply [??45]3s and quasi-isotropic laminates [0/90/(??45)2]s). Unidirectional laminates are rarely used in structural components but help to assess the different types of damage (splitting, matrix cracking, delamination) and response of the specimens under low-velocity impact and flexural loading. They are usually combined with plies of varying orientation in multidirectional laminates. These laminates exhibit a more complex behavior due to coupling effects and the combination of different failure modes. In this study, both impact and flexural response for the different laminates have been compared. Special attention is paid in the response of multidirectional laminates under flexural (and impact) loading. Shear effects are very important in this type of laminates. Only a limited number of experimental studies have been developed in this context [4-7]. Additionally, the failure modes observed under impact and flexural loading were correlated with fracture energy absorption and load-deflection behavior respectively for the unidirectional and multidirectional laminates.The results have shown that the effect of the stacking sequences on the impact and flexural response depicted similar trends than in the case of tensile response studied in previous works [8-11]. Furthermore, the present work has shown a distinctive behavior of [??45]3s angle-ply laminate.under impact loading due to its pseudo-ductile behavior. This laminate exhibited the best impact performance in terms of averaged absorbed energy but the flexural strength and stiffness drastically decreased compared to [0]12laminate. Finally, SEM and optical micrographs of fracture surfaces were used to gain an insight into the assessment of different type of damage of the previous laminates.",

The thermal and transformation load contributions are decomposed into superpositions of certain uniform fields with mechanical loads. Release of fiber prestress is regarded as an equivalent uniaxial compression applied at the edges of each prestressed ply. Optimized distributions of fiber prestress are found in individual plies such that stresses in both laminate interior and at the free edges remain within allowable limits, while the applied mechanical load may change from zero to a certain maximum value.

The aim of the investigation described in this article was to develop a model capable of predicting the fatigue delamination growth in a general case, under varying mode mix conditions. The crack growth development in essentially unidirectional laminates of carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy was analysed in terms of the Paris law for different constant propagation modes: mode I (double-cantilever beam test), mode II (end-notched flexure test) and different mixed-modes I/II (mixed-mode bending test). The dependence of the Paris law parameters on mode mix is compared with the existing models in the literature. It is shown that these models do not reproduce the non-monotonic dependence on mode mix which has been observed in experimental data. Therefore, an improved phenomenological model is introduced and compared with the experimental data obtained by other researchers. To check the ability of the model to predict variable mixed-mode fatigue delamination, the mixed-mode end-loaded split test was employed and the experimental results were compared to the predictions of the model. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the dependency of the crack propagation rates on the degree of mode mix are also discussed on the basis of fractographic analysis. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Metallographic microscopy was used to observe the damage characteristics of the perpendicular cross-section of the impacted laminates after a micropowder polishing treatment.

A great deal of research has been focused on attempting to assess the relationship between interfacial structure and properties of fiber–matrix composites. It is at the interfacial area where stress concentration develops because of differences in the thermal expansion coefficients between the reinforcement and the matrix phase. A significant mismatch in the environmentally induced degradation of matrix and fiber leads to the evolution of localized stress and strain fields in the FRP composite. The present investigation aims to study the effects of changing hygrothermal conditioning cycles (either by changing relative humidity (RH) and keeping the temperature constant, or by changing the temperature while RH the same is maintained) on moisture gain/loss kinetics and on interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of varied weight fraction glass fiber reinforced epoxy and polyester matrices composites. The mechanical assessment is extended to evaluate the loading rate sensitivity of hygrothermally shocked glass/epoxy and glass/polyester laminates at 2 and 50mm/min crosshead speeds, respectively. Observations on absorption/desorption kinetics are noticed to be dependent on the nature of hygrothermal shock cycle and on the weight fraction of fiber reinforcement. The results of mechanical performance are statistically significant at different stages of conditioning. Shear values are found to be greater at higher crosshead speed for all undertaken situations. Mechanical responses are observed to be dependent on the matrix resin and the type of hygrothermal shock cycle. Very little and limited literature is open to address the important interactions of polymer composites with this kind of realistic environmental situation.",

Nevertheless, the understanding of the mechanisms governing failure under high speed loadings remain largely unknown. The effect of rate and fibre content on failure mechanisms was investigated by viewing fractured surfaces of tensile specimens using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Tensile tests were conducted on a woven glass/epoxy laminate at increasing rates of strain. A second laminate (with random continuous glass reinforcement) was tested in tension at varying fibre volume fractions in order to ascertain the relationship between fibre content and failure mechanisms. The results suggest a brittle tensile failure in fibres of the woven laminate. In addition, the matrix was observed to play a greater role in the failure process as speed was increased, resulting in increased matrix damage and bunch fibre pull-out. The results also indicated that increasing the fibre volume fraction increased the likelihood of a matrix dominated failure mode. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

          "abstract": "The effect of strain rate on the compressive and shear behavior of carbon/epoxy composite materials was investigated. Strain rate behavior of composites with fiber waviness was also studied. Falling weight impact system and servohydraulic testing machine were used for dynamic characterisation of composite materials in compression at strain rates up to several hundred per second. Strain rates below 10s−1 were generated using a hydraulic testing machine. Strain rates above 10s−1 were generated using the drop tower apparatus developed. Seventy-two-ply unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminates (IM6G/3501-6) loaded in the longitudinal and transverse directions and [(08/908)2/0̄8]s crossply laminates were characterised. Off-axis (30 and 45°) compression tests of the same unidirectional material were also conducted to obtain the in-plane shear stress–strain behavior. The 90° properties, which are governed by the matrix, show an increase in modulus and strength over the static values but no significant change in ultimate strain. The shear stress–strain behavior, which is also matrix-dominated, shows high nonlinearity with a plateau region at a stress level that increases significantly with increasing strain rate. The 0° and crossply laminates show higher strength and strain values as the strain rate increases, whereas the modulus increases only slightly over the static value. The increase in strength and ultimate strain observed may be related to the shear behavior of the composite and the change in failure modes. In all cases the dynamic stress–strain curves stiffen as the strain rate increases. The stiffening is lowest in the longitudinal case and highest in the transverse and shear cases. Unidirectional and crossply specimens with fiber waviness were fabricated and tested. It is shown that, with severe fiber waviness, strong nonlinearity occurs in the stress–strain curves due to fiber waviness with significant stiffening as the strain rate increases.",

          "abstract": "The goal of this research was to evaluate possible damage suppression in multi-directional notched laminates through the use of slightly off-axis longitudinal plies. These &#039;non-traditional&#039; laminates were compared to laminates with 08 longitudinal plies for quasi-isotropic and hard lay-ups, for open hole tension, filled hole tension, and single-shear bearing loadings. In-situ radiographic inspections were performed to evaluate damage initiation, progression, and suppression. In notched tension, the non-traditional laminates were less strong and stiff than their traditional counterparts, but X-ray images clearly showed the suppression of longitudinal splitting and delamination. Under single-shear bearing loads, the non-traditional laminates demonstrated increased bearing resistance compared to traditional laminates, and the non-traditional laminates were less prone to damage in the longitudinal plies.",

The use of advanced signal processing techniques based on time-frequency analysis is explained in order to get information on the damage developing in the composite. The signal Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) has been computed and several robust noise reduction algorithms have been applied. Principally, Wiener adaptive filtering, improved spectral subtraction filtering, minimum-phase FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filtering and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based filtering have been used. An energy and frequency-based detection criterion is introduced to detect transient signals that can be correlated with the Modal Acoustic Emission (MAE) results and thus damage in the composite material. Hints are that time-frequency analysis and Hankel Total Least Square (HTLS) method can also be used for damage characterisation (delamination, matrix cracking and fiber breaking). ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The insertion of local through-thickness reinforcements into dry fiber preforms by stitching provides a possibility to improve the mechanical performance of polymer-matrix composites perpendicular to the laminate plane (out-of-plane). Three-dimensional stress states can be sustained by stitching yarns, leading to increased out-of-plane properties, such as impact resistance and damage tolerance. On the other hand, 3D reinforcements induce dislocations of the in-plane fibers causing fiber waviness and the formation of resin pockets in the stitch vicinity after resin infusion which may reduce the in-plane stiffness and strength properties of the laminate. In the present paper an experimental study on the influence of varying stitching parameters on in-plane and out-of-plane properties of non-crimp fabric (NCF) carbon fiber/epoxy laminates is presented, namely, shear modulus and strength as well as compression after impact (CAI) strength and mode I energy release rate. The direction of stitching, thread diameter, spacing and pitch length as well as the direction of loading (which is to be interpreted as the direction of the three rail shear loading or the direction of crack propagation in case of mode 1 energy release rate testing) were varied, and their effect on the mechanical properties was evaluated statistically. The stitching parameters were found to have ambivalent effect on the mechanical properties. Larger thread diameters and increased stitch densities result in enhanced CAI strengths and energy release rates but deteriorate the in-plane properties of the laminate. On the other hand, a good compromise between both effects can be found with a proper selection of the stitching configurations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

In order to detect the damage extension in the laminate, the change in the spectrum shape was measured using an embedded FBG sensor and was compared with that obtained by numerical simulation. The shape of the reflection spectrum did not change during the cyclic load test; however, it did change with increased strain in the static load test, due to damage around the hole. To clarify this difference, the polished surface of the cross section of the specimen was analyzed. Debonding was observed between the optical fiber and matrix during the cyclic load test. These results lead us to conclude that fatigue damage around a hole in a composite laminate may not be detected with an FBG sensor due to the debondings. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The tensile strength of the 0??plies within different cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates of varying size and stacking sequence has been investigated. For those lay-ups having failure confined to the gauge section, no size effect was observed in the strength of 0??plies. In laminates exhibiting a size versus strength relationship, failures were found to occur in the gauge section for the smallest laminates, but at the grip for the larger laminates. The occurrence of failure at the grips is not obvious for these lay-ups. A major purpose of this paper is to identify the failure initiation point, and the sequence of events that leads to complete fracture of 0??plies in unidirectional laminates, and the quasi-isotropic and cross-ply lay-ups. A statistically significant set of 3-point bend tests of unidirectional beams was conducted to obtain valid parameters (Weibull modulus and strength) for a Weibull-statistics-based strength model which would be used to predict the ultimate strength of 0??plies within different cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates. No significant difference between the maximum stress in bending or strength of the valid tensile tests was found. In contrast Weibull theory predicted unidirectional strength loss of over 30% for the range of volumes tested. Although the dramatic strength scaling observed here has been shown to arise from the test method, the authors are not ready to rule out scaling effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effect of voids on the mechanisms of transverse failure was therefore investigated for predominantly unidirectional resin transfer moulded laminates of glass-fibre-fabric/vinylester. Laminates with the highest average content of voids had a transverse strain to failure as high as 2% whereas low void content laminates failed at 0.3%. Only a few large and well-defined transverse cracks formed in low void content laminates before final failure. Multiple transverse cracks with irregular shape as well as numerous smaller cracks formed in the high void content laminates. The irregularity of these cracks resulted in lower stress concentration and stress level in the small amount of weft bundles orientated in the loading direction. A simple model was developed in order to demonstrate this and explain the high strain to failure of high void content laminates. ?? 1995.",

          "abstract": "Composites have recently gained considerable acceptance in the transportation sector such as the aerospace and automotive industries, as these materials offer the ability to reduce weight, greenhouse gas emissions and associated fuel cost. Conversely, problems related to material behavior, cost, manufacturing process, assembly and choice of joining technique pose challenges that limit the wide acceptance and implementation of the composite materials. Specifically, a major problem related to joining is the use of mechanical/fastener joints with drilled holes that can damage the continuous fibers and cause considerable reduction in the load carrying capacity of resulting composite structures.To address this issue, an innovative solution that manufactures fabric laminates using &#039;tailored placement&#039; of fibers around the holes/notch was proposed. This eliminates the need for drilling and machining of holes thereby eliminating the sources of delamination. The tensile performance of notched composites from the novel tailored fiber placement (TFP) approach was compared to conventional notched composites. Additionally, the effect of various fiber placement patterns and machining processes on the strength, damage initiation and fracture mode of notched composite laminates were studied. Specifically, the stress and strain fields around the notch were thoroughly evaluated. The experimental results for notched specimens were compared with the damage initiation and strength predictions obtained from the Hashin failure criteria as available in commercially available FEA package (ABAQUS??). A good agreement between experimental results and numerical predictions was observed. Overall, the proposed approach shows great promise in the use of tailored fiber placement technique to eliminate delaminations, maintain continuous fiber alignments and reduce associated stress concentrations in a wide range of composite applications including but not limited to mechanical fastening.",

          "abstract": "The mixed mode delamination behavior of through-thickness reinforced carbon-epoxy laminates was investigated using two different test specimens, a T-stiffener and a mixed-mode bending (MMB) specimen. Small quantities of titanium or carbon z-fibers (short rods) substantially improve delamination resistance in both types of specimen. Reinforcement raises the ultimate strength of the MMB specimen by a factor of three. However, the failure sequence and therefore the ultimate load in the T-stiffeners depend strongly on the test configuration. No change in ultimate load is seen in some cases but up to 40% improvement is observed in others. Improved delamination resistance results from crack bridging by the z-fibers, which reduces the driving force for crack growth. Mode I crack displacement is suppressed more effectively than mode II displacement, resulting in purely mode II cracking in what without z-fibers would be a mixed mode or primarily mode I loading situation. This important consequence of so-called large scale bridging effects confirms recent theoretical results for delamination specimens. The mechanisms of bridging and crack propagation are described here in detail. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The evaluation of these damaged areas is important to assess the effects of the laminate microstructure on the response of the material to the imposed loading. In this paper bulletproof laminates were obtained using 30 plies of glass-fiber reinforced-epoxy matrix composites. The ballistic performance of these laminates was varied by modifying the properties of the constituent laminate or by changing the laminate assemblage. An automated digital analysis procedure was developed in order to determine size and shape parameters that characterize the damaged areas. The procedure developed proved to be robust and sensible enough to cope with subtle variations on the damaged areas, which are due to the differences on the mechanical response of the composites caused by modifications on their microstructure. The results obtained show that not only the area of delamination is important to quantify the ballistic performance. The isotropy of the ballistic response, determined measuring the Feret Ratio or the Circular Shape Factor, is also important. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The active structural health monitoring (SHM) approach for the complex composite laminate structures of wind turbine blades (WTBs), addresses the important and complicated problem of signal noise. After illustrating the wind energy industry&#039;s development perspectives and its crucial requirement for SHM, an improved redundant second generation wavelet transform (IRSGWT) pre-processing algorithm based on neighboring coefficients is introduced for feeble signal denoising. The method can avoid the drawbacks of conventional wavelet methods that lose information in transforms and the shortcomings of redundant second generation wavelet (RSGWT) denoising that can lead to error propagation. For large scale WTB composites, how to minimize the number of sensors while ensuring accuracy is also a key issue. A sparse sensor array optimization of composites for WTB applications is proposed that can reduce the number of transducers that must be used. Compared to a full sixteen transducer array, the optimized eight transducer configuration displays better accuracy in identifying the correct position of simulated damage (mass of load) on composite laminates with anisotropic characteristics than a non-optimized array. It can help to guarantee more flexible and qualified monitoring of the areas that more frequently suffer damage. The proposed methods are verified experimentally on specimens of carbon fiber reinforced resin composite laminates.",

Compression after impact strength was also evaluated. Thin-ply laminates showed 23% higher strength than standard-ply laminates. Transverse cracks decreased drastically in thin-ply laminates, and localized delamination was largely extended. Based on the discussions in our previous study and the literature, the specific ply thickness without drastic crack propagation appears to be less than or equal to 40 {micro}m. Therefore, the thin laminates showed few and localized transverse cracks and delamination was largely propagated in the midplane.",

          "abstract": "Vacuum infusion (VI) is being considered as a viable alternative to more traditional hand lay-up (HL). Main reason in favor of the more costly technique is the cleaner and friendlier work environment. Moreover, VI potentially offers another important benefit over HL in that prepreg levels of resin may be achieved, resulting in stronger and lighter laminates. The present paper compares the two manufacturing techniques on the basis of the response to repeated impact loading. The laminate is a thick non-symmetric glass-fiber-reinforced plastics intended for nautical application. Four impact velocities (1.5, 2.2, 3.1 and 3.8 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to 40 repeated impacts or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of damage progression by visual observation of the impacted specimens, evolution of the peak force and of the bending stiffness with the number of impacts and by calculating the Damage Index (DI), a damage variable recently proposed by the authors to monitor the penetration process in thick laminates. Results point out that for impact velocities for which no perforation occurs within test duration, the experimental data essentially overlap. On the contrary, for perforation tests, HL specimens survived more impacts before perforating absorbing more total energy than VI specimens. Plots of the DI variable against the number of impacts were observed to exhibit an initial linear portion, owing to a stable process of damage accumulation within the laminate, and to undergo an unstable growth a few impacts before perforation. When comparing the VI and HL specimens it was observed that, given an impact energy, the level of damage at first impact as well as the rate of stable damage accumulation is alike for the two sets of specimens. On the contrary, it is the number of impacts of the stable damage accumulation region which is lower for VI specimens. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Past work has focused on experimental and analytical studies of axial and transverse stiffness reduction due to matrix cracks. By comparison, there is relatively little experimental work addressing shear modulus degradation from matrix damage. In this paper, a modified Isoipescu coupon is proposed to study the shear modulus degradation due to loading perpendicular to the fibers direction. The layup and coupon geometry were selected in a way that controls the severity of the damage and allows the measurement of shear and transverse stiffness degradation in the same coupon. The proposed method showed good agreement with results from tubular specimens and has advantages of simplified specimen fabrication using standard test fixtures. The results provided the first experimental comparison of shear modulus reduction, from transverse damage, to the predictive models.

The composite is tested under uniaxial in-plane tensile loading in the warp, fill and ??45 bias directions. An &quot;S-shape&quot; nonlinearity observed in the stress-strain curves is explained by the concurrent contributions of inherent carbon fiber stiffening (&quot;non-Hookean behavior&quot;), fiber straightening, and gradual damage accumulation. Several approaches to the determination of a single-value Young&#039;s modulus from a significantly nonlinear stress-strain curve are discussed and the best approach recommended. Also, issues related to the experimental determination of effective Poisson&#039;s ratios for this class of composites are discussed, and their possible resolution suggested. The observed experimental values of the warp- and fill-directional tensile strengths are much higher than those typically obtained for 3D interlock weave carbon/epoxy composites while the nonlinear material behavior observed for the ??45 -directional tensile loading is in a qualitative agreement with the earlier results for other textile composites. Results of the damage initiation and progression, monitoried by means of acoustic emission, full-field strain optical measurements, X-rays and optical microscopy, are illustrated and discussed in detail. The damage modes at different stages of the increasing tensile loading are analyzed, and the principal progressive damage mechanisms identified, including the characteristic crack patterns developed at each damage stage. It is concluded that significant damage initiation of the present material occurs in the same strain range as in traditional cross-ply laminates, while respective strain range for other previously studied carbon/epoxy textile composites is significantly lower. Overall the revealed advantages in stiffness, strength and progressive damage behavior of the studied composite are mainly attributed to the absence of crimp and only minimal fiber waviness in the reinforcing 3DNCOW preform.?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While the tensile failure strain of the carbon fiber reinforced epoxy-MWCNT composite increased, its tensile modulus and strength remained almost unaffected. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was employed to measure the damping performance of the two composite systems. The composite samples containing MWCNTs retained higher damping indicating their greater capability to attenuate impact shocks generated during an impact phenomenon. The samples were subjected to out-of-plane impact (at ???100ms-1) from which the energy dissipation capacity of the composites was evaluated. Incorporating MWCNTs into the CFRP increased the absorbed impact energy by 21%. The punch test provided valuable information on the damage mechanics of the ballistic impact of the composite panels. It also contrasted the effect of high-stain-rate on the impact test. The consequences of adding MWCNTs to the matrix of CFRPs on the impact progressive damage and energy absorption were discussed in terms of the damage mechanisms and the dynamic damping behavior of the composites. To better comprehend the effect of adding CNTs on the impact damage mechanisms, X-ray radiography was carried out on the impacted panels. It was shown that the addition of MWCNTs to the matrix of a CFRP improves its inter- and intra-laminar mechanical performance yielding a better impact resistance. It was confirmed that the impact failure behavior of the studied composite systems could be predicted from the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical tests. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Up to the present time, numerous variants of these forms have been proposed for traditional and composite structural materials and these have been described by the authors of many textbooks on composite materials. Omitting the history and comparative analysis of particular criteria that can be found elsewhere, we mainly discuss here the practical aspects of the problem. In many applications, a progressive failure analysis of composite laminates is required to predict their mechanical behavior under various loading conditions. We present a combined elastoplastic damage model and a strain-driven implicit integration procedure for fiber reinforced composite materials and structures that involves a consideration of their mechanical response prior to the initiation of damage, prediction of damage initiation, and modeling of postfailure behavior.",

The ability to computationally predict the extent of damage and compression-after-impact (CAI) strength of a composite structure can potentially lead to the exploration of a larger design space without incurring significant time and cost penalties. A high-fidelity three-dimensional composite damage model, to predict both low-velocity impact damage and CAI strength of composite laminates, has been developed and implemented as a user material subroutine in the commercial finite element package, ABAQUS/Explicit. The intralaminar damage model component accounts for physically-based tensile and compressive failure mechanisms, of the fibres and matrix, when subjected to a three-dimensional stress state. Cohesive behaviour was employed to model the interlaminar failure between plies with a bi-linear traction–separation law for capturing damage onset and subsequent damage evolution. The virtual tests, set up in ABAQUS/Explicit, were executed in three steps, one to capture the impact damage, the second to stabilize the specimen by imposing new boundary conditions required for compression testing, and the third to predict the CAI strength. The observed intralaminar damage features, delamination damage area as well as residual strength are discussed. It is shown that the predicted results for impact damage and CAI strength correlated well with experimental testing without the need of model calibration which is often required with other damage models.",

          "abstract": "This chapter reviews blast impact experimentation on glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) and carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sandwich composite materials and laminate composite tubes. Explosive charges of 0.64– 100 kg TNT equivalent were used during these air- and underwater-blast tests. The difference in response and damage inflicted from underwater- and air-blast loading was assessed from strain-field measurements and post-blast specimen analysis. Procedures for monitoring the structural response of such materials during blast events have been devised. High-speed photography was employed during the airblast loading of GFRP and CFRP sandwich panels, in conjunction with digital image correlation (DIC), to monitor the deformation of these structures under shock loading. Failure mechanisms have been revealed using DIC and confirmed in post-test sectioning. The improved performance of composite sandwich structures with CFRP skins compared to GFRP equivalent constructions is demonstrated for air-blast experiments. Strain gauges were used to monitor the structural response of similar sandwich materials and GFRP tubular laminates during underwater shocks. The effect of the supporting/backing medium (air or water) of the target facing the shock has been identified during these studies. Mechanisms of failure have been established such as core crushing, skin/core cracking, delamination and fibre breakage. Strain gauge data supported the mechanisms for such damage. A transition in behaviour was observed in the sandwich panels when subject to an underwater blast as opposed to an air-blast load. Damage mechanisms notably shifted from distributed core shear failure originating from regions of high shear in air blast to global core crushing in underwater blast. The full-scale experimental results presented here will assist in the development of analytical and computational models. Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of boundary conditions with regards to blast resistant design.",

Very good correlations between the model and experimental stress/strain data have been achieved for both the cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates (subject to both uniaxial and biaxial loading), principally because ply cracking in a single orientation is expected to occur for a significant part of the stress/strain curves. Additional damage modes must be taken into account (fiber fracture) before predictions of strength can be made that are based on the modeling of physical micro-mechanisms associated with laminate failure. A rudimentary physically based approach to the prediction of laminate failure is made by considering fiber strain within the laminate in relation to the average failure strain of a single fiber. The chapter presents the assessment of the ply cracking models, which lead to good predictions of laminate stress/strain behavior that is consistent with data provided for the Failure Exercise.",

In lieu of a macrohomogeneous, anisotropic medium, the composites are treated as a heterogeneous material. This model of the inidividual fibers and matrix separately is of importance, especially for predicting detailed damage mechanisms resulting from localized, intensive loadings. The numerical results show that damage in BAl composite laminates due to high-velocity impact is caused not only by perforation but also by a great deal of delamination. It is also shown that for impact velocities exceeding the ballistic limit, a flat projectile can result in a larger perforation hole and more severe damage to the composite targets than a thick projectile with the same mass.",

A significant effect of this damage is to reduce the strength of the laminate, particularly in compression; however, owing to the complexity of the damage the precise mechanisms controlling the strength reduction are unclear. In this paper a technique is described for replicating impact damage artificially by including PTFE film delaminants and cut plies during lay-up. Comparisons between real and artificially reproduced damage are made to demonstrate the validity of the technique. Experimental methods of X-radiography and resin injection are developed to allow the mechanisms controlling strength reduction to be assessed, both under tensile and compressive loading. Under tensile load the reduction in strength caused by impact damage is found to be entirely due to fibre cracks and may be estimated by using a net-section calculation. Meanwhile under compression, strength reduction is largely caused by the redistribution of stress resulting from buckling of delaminated plies and may be predicted by calculating stresses in the undelaminated part of the laminate.",

          "abstract": "For several years, Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chauss??es (LCPC) has worked on the development of new cement composites in order to obtain materials sufficiently tough and ductile to be used in structures or structural elements without any other reinforcement that fibres. Then a multi-scale fibre reinforced cement-based composite (MSFRCC) has been developed and patented. It is principally characterized by a high percentage of fibres, percentage equal to 11% per m3. Three fibre dimensions are used in this composite. In the present article, a qualitative analysis of damage mechanisms of this material under impact and fatigue loadings is proposed. Concerning impact loading condition, the main conclusions are:???Apparent fibre-matrix adherence, which increases with the loading rate, leads to an increase in material modulus of rupturel, an increase much greater than for all existing cement-based materials due to high percentage of fibres used;???Mechanical homogenization of composite with loading rate is the result of cracks delocalization during cracking process. This delocalization results from viscous effects generated within the matrix and around the fibre-matrix interfaces. Concerning fatigue loading condition, the main conclusions are:???Intermediate fibre length (high percentage of meso-fibres) that is highly and positively involved in material static tensile strength, corresponds to scale of fibre that is sensitive to fatigue loading. As a matter of fact, meso-fibres become rapidly inactive and composite can no longer behave as a multi-scale reinforcement material. Material strength is then greatly affected.???If the initial cracking state of the material before fatigue loading corresponds to a state of tensile strain that is less than or equal to 1.27 10- 3, meso-fibres perfectly play their role with respect to relevant cracks (i.e. meso-cracks whose opening corresponds to their mechanical efficiency domain, that means less than 100????m), material fatigue behaviour being then good (fatigue rupture after 2 millions of cycles).???Specimens that did not break before 2 millions of cycles have better residual bending behaviour (gain of 6.5%) than reference specimens (specimens which were not previously loaded in fatigue) This result is the consequence of a morphological modification of cracks due to fatigue loading. Indeed, fatigue cycles lead to a gradual &quot;blunting&quot; of crack tips, cracks that subsequently become less dangerous with respect to their potential propagation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, instrumented impact tests were used to characterize such effects for carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic toughened epoxy laminates. Impact resistance was characterized in terms of load and energy parameters measured during penetration tests. These parameters were related to damage in the lami nates by conducting rebound tests followed by ultrasonic imaging and microscopy. The results clearly demonstrated a relationship between the onset of damage and the first peak in the load versus deflection plots obtained in the penetration tests. No major effects of stacking sequence or reinforcement form were apparent in terms of the energy required for the onset of damage in the laminates. Energy to maximum load was found to be highly de pendent on stacking sequence. Substitution of woven reinforcement for unidirectional tape in a quasi-isotropic layup resulted in a substantial decrease in the energy to maximum load. The results in terms of peak load showed similar trends. No effects of stacking se quence or reinforcement form were observed in terms of energy after peak load. It is ap parent from this work that stacking sequence and reinforcement form can have significant effects on impact resistance particularly at higher impact energies.",

A civilian version of the US Army&#039;s M4 carbine was used for the ballistic tests where penetration velocities were well above the ballistic limit for 5.56 mm projectiles. Compression-only data were initially obtained to characterize the various modes of damage. Samples without simultaneous compressive preload were subjected to ballistic penetration alone and then compressively loaded to failure. Finally, samples that had previously undergone ballistic testing at varying levels of compressive preloads were loaded in compression to determine the residual compressive failure strength. For simultaneous loading, samples were subjected to a specified compressive preload while a projectile was fired through the center of the sample. This study finds that the effect of simultaneous preload and ballistic penetration results in a greater extent of damage propagation than for ballistic penetration alone, increasing the possibility of initiating buckling failure of the loaded plate. The equivalent ballistic limit velocity for a given laminate and thickness is also likely to be reduced with increasing preload in composite laminates",

By introducing the Monte Carlo simulation and response surface method respectively, a static strength-based reliability model is proposed to predict the reliability of aluminium-carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminates for composite vessels. The burst pressure of composite vessels for different layer structures is predicted using finite element analysis. In the reliability analysis, two design parameters for composite vessels: the radius of polar axis and the winding thickness of each composite layer at the cylinder are assumed to obey the uniform distribution and Gaussian distribution respectively, and the burst pressure of composite vessels is taken as the random output response. Effects of the number of sampling and the limit strength on the strength reliability of composite vessels are explored. Besides, the numerical results obtained using two methods and two distributions for two random input parameters are compared in terms of the calculation efficiency and accuracy. Numerical results also indicate the proposed probability method exhibits preferable advantage over the conventional design method merely using empirical safety coefficient. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous finite element results show that when an edge-cracked composite specimen is subjected to torsion loading, the fracture behavior is dominated by Mode III. In order to simplify the calculation of strain energy release rate, an analytical series solution employing effective moduli is derived to study the fracture behavior of edge-cracked multilayer laminates. This analytical tool is applied for angle-ply laminates to characterize the critical strain energy release rates. Several angle-ply laminates with artificial damage located at arbitrary interfaces have been tested to find the interlaminar fracture toughness under torsion loading. Experimental results show that GIIIC ranges from 650 to 850 J/m2 for most cases. Test results reveal that this theory and experimental method can be used to find interlaminar GIIIC values for angle-ply composites. ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.",

Filament wound tubular composite specimens were immersed in distilled water at two different temperatures for approximately four months and their moisture absorption was recorded. The rate of moisture absorption was greater for the group of specimens immersed in distilled water at an elevated temperature (50 ??C) than those at room temperature (???20 ??C). Multi-axial tests were performed subsequently, and it was observed that for all biaxial stress ratios, strength and stiffness decreased to some extent with the presence of moisture and increasing temperature. Strains parallel and transverse to the fibers at functional failure (leakage) showed little variation in the presence of moisture and temperature with the exception of pure hoop loading. Microscopically, the greatest water damage was apparent in the matrix and at the fiber-matrix interface where there was less resin adhesion to the fibers with increasing water temperature. Fiber strength was also negatively affected, possibly due to either leaching out of the glass fibers interface layer or glass fiber embrittlement, and less effective bonding and load distribution at the fiber-matrix interface. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The change in interfacial shear sliding stress due to cyclic loading-unloading was obtained by a thin specimen push-back test. The interfacial shear sliding stress decreased slightly after cyclic loading and this behaviour originated from wear of the sliding interface. The crack growth rate of the composite, da/dN, vs. crack length relation was strongly affected by the interaction process. Elastic constraint before interface partial symmetrical debonding and crack bowing after this debonding were the major sources of da/dN reduction of the composite. After the matrix crack surrounded the fiber, da/dN was slowed by the crack-shielding mechanism originating from fiber bridging. This process continued throughout the tested number of applied cycles, because the interfacial shear sliding stress transfer operated during cyclic loading. The three-dimensional crack-fiber interaction process during crack propagation and its effects on da/dN under cyclic loading in a fiber-reinforced brittle matrix composite were discussed.",

For the dynamic case, the predictions were 70-96% of the observed expenditure level. This is considered to be due to the absence in the analysis of factors such as inertia, strain-rate and wave propagation effects, matrix shearing and fragmentation, as well as obliquity and rotation motion of the striker. The correspondence in the case of static loading was considerably poorer, indicating substantial and non-measurable energy absorption by the test apparatus, including substantial frictional dissipation in in the specimen holder and between sample and penetrator. ?? 1994.",

The membrane and bending energy were calculated from image analysis of the deformed shape of the impacted specimen while the delamination energy was calculated by using the deplying technique. The multiaxial warp-knit composite showed higher impact fracture toughness and bending properties and this resulted in a bending energy increase and reduced delamination while the membrane and delamination energy were the dominant energy-absorption modes for the woven composite laminate. The delaminated areas in the woven laminates were much larger than those in the multiaxial warp-knit composites, while the delamination energy absorption was slightly higher since the impact fracture toughness of the woven laminate was much smaller than those of the multiaxial warp-knit composites.

Static tests of the small plates are also conducted. It is demonstrated that using impact response to predict the threshold values of damage initiation is significantly faster and cheaper because it does not need to examine impacted specimens. The ultimate thresholds are found to be dependent on the in-plane dimension of the laminates, two sets of specimens provide two bounds which become close as the thickness of the laminates increases. It is shown that the damage energy and force maps are effective in monitoring damage growth in addition to identifying the thresholds of damage initiation, which are close to the predicted values based on impact response. It is also shown that damage initiation when dominated by delamination can be predicted by a simple analytical model.

For the postbuckling analysis of VAT composite plates, an efficient tool based on the variational principle and the Rayleigh-Ritz method is developed. In the optimisation study, a mathematical definition based on Lagrangian polynomials, which requires few design parameters, is used to define a general fiber angle distribution of the VAT plate. A genetic algorithm is subsequently used to determine the optimal VAT configuration for maximum postbuckling performance. The optimisation of square VAT laminates under compression loading for different in-plane boundary conditions is studied and compared with straight fiber designs. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The impacted specimens were cycled in tension-tension fatigue until failure. Cracks developed along side the dent and also at the edges of the gauge section of the specimen. Aluminum baseline specimens had significantly lower fatigue lives than the FML specimens. The stress-state surrounding the dent is complicated and contributed to unusual fatigue crack initiation behavior in some GLARE variants. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Fiber Metal Laminates (FML) consist of thin, high strength aluminium alloy sheets alternately bonded to plies of fiber-reinforced epoxy adhesive. They provide an ideal combination of metals and composites that results in a material, which combines the best features of organic matrix composites and metals, without sharing their individual disadvantages. FML offer substantial weight savings relative to current metallic structures. Further. the number of parts required to build a component may be dramatically less than the number of parts needed to construct the same component of metal alloy. This can lead to labour savings. sometimes offsetting the higher price of the present materials. These features, together with superior fatigue behaviour, damage tolerant properties. inherent resistance to corrosion, good fire resistance for safety improvement, make FML very attractive candidate materials for future aircraft structures {I-3]. Later a new concept apply on this hybrid material: Fiber-Metal Laminates with Splice or Spliced Laminates. The development of spliced laminates has been a logical step after the identifIcation of the favorable behavior of FML. Spliced laminates may provide a good solution obtaining substantially increased dimensions of spliced products. The splicing concept offers the same benefit (20 - 50% weight savings) as for a regular FML panel, but for much wider panels (&gt; 4 meters). This increased width capability can result in a significant reduction in manufacturing cost. These attributes make spliced laminates promising candidates for fuselage and lower wing materials for the next generation of Very Large Civil Transport (VLCT) aircraft and the Ultra High Capacity Aircraft (UHCA) for 600 to 800 passengers [4].",

The constitutive equations of the Twaron® fiber tows (poly paraphenylene terepthalamide, PPTA) under high strain rates have been established to characterize the mechanical behaviors under impact loading. The Twaron® fiber tows were assumed as transversely isotropic viscoelastic material to derive the constitutive equations. The maximum strain failure criterion was adopted for defining the failure of the PPTA fiber tows. A user-defined subroutine UMAT (FORTRAN user-material subroutine) was written for combining both the constitutive equations and the failure criterion in numerical calculation. Based on a micro-scale geometrical model of the 3DAWC, the UMAT for the PPTA fiber tows was combined with a commercial available finite element method (FEM) software package LS-DYNA to calculate the ballistic impact damage when the 3DAWC panel penetrated under a hemispherical-cylindrical steel projectile. It was found that the FEM simulation agrees well with the experimental results. The impact damage morphologies and damage propagations, the energy absorptions and the stress distributions in the 3DAWC panel were presented to elucidate the ballistic penetration damage mechanisms for optimizing the ballistic protection capacity of the 3-D woven composite material.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of strain rate and temperature on flow behavior of the composites tested have been evaluated and fractographic observations made of the fracture surfaces in order to understand the fracture mechanisms. Results show that the composite flow stress is sensitive to both strain rate and temperature, and that temperature increase noticeably reduces the strain-rate dependence of the flow stress. Fracture strain is found to be greater at low strain rates, increasing, however, with strain rate and temperature in the dynamic range. Changes of fracture features and damage process appear to relate directly to both strain rate and temperature. Damage initiation and propagation processes are identified.

Increasing use of these structural parts has given rise to the need for tests to identify characteristics of their fatigue behavior. The aim of this study was to determine fatigue data, and observe macroscopic and microscopic damage mechanisms of filament-wound composite tubes under axial cyclic loading. For this purpose, fatigue lives of the epoxy matrix, ??55?? glass fiber-wound specimens are determined for stress levels of 60, 70, and 80% of their tensile strength. Three different frequencies; 0.1, 1, and 10 Hz, were applied at each stress level for the constant amplitude sinusoidal loading with a stress ratio of R = 0.1. Results were evaluated in the form of S-N curves to reveal the effects of stress level and loading frequency on the three stages of fatigue damage. These stages observed were; first craze initiation in the matrix, then craze propagation and densification along the fiber winding direction, and finally breakage in the fibers leading to disintegration. Fatigue lives of the specimens decreased with an increase in the stress level, while they were generally increased by increasing the frequency. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two configurations of flax/epoxy composites layup were studied namely, [0] unidirectional ply orientation and [±45]. The high cycle fatigue strength was determined using a thermographic criterion developed in a previous study. The fatigue limit obtained by the thermographic criterion was confirmed by the results obtained through conventional experimental methods (i.e., Stress level versus Number of cycles to failure). Furthermore, a model for predicting the fatigue life using the IR thermography was evaluated. The model was found to have a good predictive value for the fatigue life. In order to investigate the mechanism of damage initiation in flax/epoxy composites and the damage evolution, during each fatigue test we monitored the crack propagation for a stress level and at different damage stages, a direct correlation between the percentage of cracks and the mean strain was observed.

It was carried out at Cranfield University Composites Centre, Milton Keynes, UK as an MSc by research thesis project. A series of low-cost composite laminates, with or without novel veils provided by Tenax, was manufactured using current aircraft carbon fiber preforms via vacuum infusion (VI) molding in this research. All the investigations on damage resistance of these panels were carried out according to the British Standard (BS ISO 18353:2009). Initial damage was induced using a falling weight apparatus mounting a 16 mm hemispherical tip. C-scan and Micrograph were employed to reveal damage characteristics. Finally, both compression after impact (CAI) and plain compression strength were experimented. The behaviors of these panels, including damage size, damage construction, residual compression strength, and compression strength reduction, were utilized to investigate how and to what extent the veils affected the damage resistance. The results show that using veils is an efficient method of improving the damage resistance of the laminates studied. Maximum 32% increase in residual compression strength is achieved via veils accompanying with 7% increase in cost. ?? 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA &amp; BUAA.",

The experimental results indicate that the 3D laminates consistently had greater damage tolerance than the 2D laminates and the 3D monolithic composites.

The influence of different hole diameter to wavelength aspect ratios and different stacking sequences on wave scattering characteristics are investigated. The results show that amplitudes and directivity distribution of the scattered Lamb wave depend on these parameters.

The multiscale model is based on the embedded cell method, with detailed microstructure embedded into the macro laminate beneath the impact point, and a transition zone is introduced to link these two scales. Damage model is considered for the fibres and plastic behaviour for the matrix, and cohesive elements are used for the simulation of interface delamination. Both unidirectional and layup embedded cells are considered in the simulation so as to reveal the impact damage mechanisms from monolayer to layup levels. The simulation results indicate matrix cracking is the first damage form which occurs at the bottom of the laminate, and then delamination is induced when the matrix crack propagates to the interface, followed by fibre pull-out and fibre breakage. The simulation results are compared with available experimental results from literatures, with good agreements achieved between them on the damage morphologies.

          "abstract": "Time-dependent deformation and damage growth was studied in a rubber-toughened carbon fiber composite. Cyclic creep/recovery loading was performed on unidirectional off-axis coupons to derive the transverse and shear moduli. Constant stress-rate experiments were also performed using modal acoustic emission monitoring. This monitoring provides indirect evidence of what is believed to be the primary damage mechanisms in the material studied, matrix cracking and fiber/matrix debonding. Three significant findings from this study are emphasized in this paper. The first is the viscoelastic and viscoplastic behavior of the material with growing damage. Although a complete characterization has not been performed, emphasis is on material behavior believed to be not previously reported in the literature. The second is a new Damage Effect Study that quickly identifies the material parameters in a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive theory that are affected by damage. This study can assist in streamlining the characterization process. Finally, a simplified material model for the microstructure is developed based on AE monitoring of damage growth. This results in damage evolution equations based on AE data and viscoelastic fracture mechanics. The damage equations correlate AE data for different loading histories. The use of direct monitoring to develop damage evolution equations and the Damage Effect Study reflect a new approach to characterization testing of time-dependent materials.",

After obtaining material constants and damage relations from standard tensile tests, the material constitutive relations with damage model are implemented into commercial finite element code, abaqus. By comparing the predicted results with the experimental data, the proposed model has proven to be capable of predicting failure strength and load-deflection relations of notched laminated composites.

Interlaminar fracture at the delamination front is found to be a mixed-mode phenomenon due to the anisotropy and heterogeneity of thermo-physical properties of composite materials. This leads to the requirement of finite element evaluation of energy release rates, based on the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The strain energy release rate components along the delamination front due to a uniform temperature drop, during the manufacturing stages of composite laminates, to room temperature and subsequent mechanical loading is obtained by superimposing their respective effects based on the assumptions of linear elasticity. Numerical calculations are carried out for multi-layered cross-ply and angle-ply composite laminates and energy release rate plots demonstrate large asymmetries along the delamination front due to the interaction of residual stresses and superimposed transverse loading. ?? 2005.",

While the fracture mechanisms during crushing of synthetic fiber/polymer composites have been thoroughly studied, limited information is available on post-fracture investigation and identification of the dominant fracture mechanisms of wood/polyester composites. In this study laminates of Douglas-fir veneer were fabricated using a catalyzed polyester resin and their potentials as energy absorbers have been investigated and discussed. Factors for this study were (i) laminates symmetry (face layers of 0?? or 90??), (ii) lay-up balance (balanced and unbalanced) and (iii) number of lamina (8, 11, and 12). Samples were tested under quasi-static Combined Loading Compression (CLC) and their compressive performances were compared to control specimens using glass fiber as reinforcement. Results indicated that the effect of symmetry on compressive properties of wood veneer/polyester laminates was significant with laminates with face layers of 90?? and core layers of 0?? had the highest deflection to failure. Increasing the wood/polyester laminate thickness enhanced their energy absorbing ability by bringing more fracture mechanisms into play but it noticeably reduced the laminates compressive modulus. Despite the brittle failure of glass fiber composites wood laminates exhibited a progressive fracture mechanisms with shear buckling as the dominant mode of failure in symmetric samples. This progressive failure with high energy absorbing ability make wood/polyester laminates a good candidate to be used as an energy absorber structure where high deflection to failure and longer failure time are required.",

By replacing the woven ply by two stacked unidirectional plies corresponding to the warp and weft thicknesses, this general model is extended to cover a broad range of plies, from quasi-unidirectional to balanced woven plies.

          "abstract": "This series of papers on ±55° filament-wound glass-fibre/epoxy-resin tubes consists of three parts. In Part I, the microstructure of the composite tube was first investigated by image processing to qualify the microstructural defects produced during manufacturing. A series of mechanical tests was then carried out under various combinations of hoop and axial stresses to evaluate the tubes&#039; mechanical behaviour under pure axial tensile load, pure internal pressure, and under combined loading. Observations on specimens loaded to 20-50% of the ultimate tensile strength showed that the main damage initiation mechanisms are microcracking (matrix and transverse cracks) and delamination. Depending on the loading conditions, one of the mechanisms dominates over the other. The effect of microstructural defects on the damage initiation was clearly demonstrated. In Part II, micromechanical modelling of the damage initiation will be conducted in order to determine (1) the mechanical conditions under which different microcracking mechanisms occur and (2) the critical σzz/σθθ ratio which corresponds to the change from one mechanism to another. Emphasis is placed on assessing the influence of microstructural defects and the competition between the different mechanisms. In Part III, a macroscopical behaviour law for the tubing structure with and without damage will be presented, and the simulation results will be compared with experimental ones. © 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

Initial attention focused on investigating the effect of varying the fibre orientation, ??, on the tensile modulus and strength of a range of [Ti, ????]s carbon-fibre/PEEK FMLs. Here, as expected, increasing the offset angle, ??, resulted in a decrease in the tensile properties of the FMLs. The failure mechanisms in the hybrid laminates were investigated through a series of cyclic tensile tests on a number of edge-polished samples. An examination of the specimen edges indicated that failure in laminates whose fibres were oriented at angles between 0?? and 15?? occurred as a result of fracture of individual carbon fibres. At offset angles greater than 15??, initial failure took the form of localised debonding at the fibre-matrix interface. In addition to this debonding, laminates with values of ?? between 15?? and 45?? exhibited delamination between the composite plies. First ply failure (FPF) as well as the tensile strength of the FMLs was predicted using a number of simple failure criteria. Here, it was shown that the onset of damage under tensile loading conditions can be successfully predicted over a wide range of offset angles. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A previous study on impact response of composite laminates concluded that impact perforation was the most important damage stage in composite laminates subjected to impact loading since impact characteristics and degradation of mechanical properties of composite laminates reached critical levels once perforation took place. It was also found that thickness had a greater influence on impact perforation resistance than in-plane dimensions. However, as the composite laminates became very thick, the manufacturing cost for obtaining high-quality composite laminates could become unaffordable. In an effort to meet design requirements and to reduce manufacturing costs, assembled composite plates, which were organized by assembling multiple thin composite laminates together, were considered as alternatives to thick laminated composite plates. Various joining techniques including mechanical riveting, adhesive bonding, stitching and their combinations were used in assembling two- and four-laminate plates. Experimental results revealed that epoxy bonding outperformed other joining techniques. Although good bonding resulted in a higher impact bending stiffness and subsequently a higher perforation threshold, increasing the laminate thickness, or the number of laminates, was found to be more efficient in raising perforation threshold than improving the joining stiffness. As a major finding of the study, the assembled composite plates were found to have perforation thresholds similar to the laminated counterpart. Hence, the former could be used to replace the latter, at least, as far as perforation threshold was concerned.",

Deformation processes and fracture mechanisms of thin-plate composite laminates were examined as a function of material parameters, plate thickness, stacking sequence, and impact loading rate. For the laminates containing tough fibers, such as high-strength polyethylene, plastic deformation was found to be an important energy absorbing mechanism. High flexibility of these fibers allows the incident energy to be dispersed in a wider area and the impact load to be shared by a greater volume of material. A clean penetration crack was observed in the samples that contain primarily brittle fibers, such as graphite. This failure mode absorbed very little incident energy. In addition, both matrix-fiber interfacial debonding and interlaminar cracking were shown to be effective in dissipating impact energy. Mechanistic study indicated that the impact response of the laminates can be described by an initial stage of elastic deformation, followed by three stages of plastic deformation. Also, impact testing data showed that interlaminar hybridization with thermoplastic laminates was able to improve the impact toughness of the otherwise brittle epoxy laminates. Fiber-matrix debonding in thermoplastic laminates and interlaminar debonding between thermoplastic and epoxy laminates enhanced the impact energy absorption capacity of hybrid-matrix composites. However, due to this poor interfacial adhesion, the result of post-impact three-point bending tests indicated an inferior damage tolerance for hybrid-matrix laminates. A simplified theory for impact failure mechanisms of composite laminates is proposed. It provides a mechanistic basis for the development of a practical model for the prediction of impact failure modes. This theory has proved to be useful in the studies on the impact penetration of more brittle composites.",

The investigation focuses on the feasibility of using scale models to predict the full-scale behavior of laminates based on [Aln, 0??/90??n]s and [Aln, ??45??n]s stacking configurations. Tensile tests were undertaken on laminates that were prepared using three different scaling approaches, these being 1D (scaling the thickness dimension), 2D (scaling the in-plane dimensions) and 3D scaling where all of the dimensions were scaled appropriately. Geometrical effects were investigated by monitoring the stiffness, strength, strain to failure and the stress/strain response of the FMLs. In the 1D and 3D-scaled samples, a small decrease in tensile strength was observed with increasing scale size, an effect that was associated with a change in failure mode from tensile fracture to interply delamination. In contrast, the strength of the 2D-scaled samples increased with increasing scale size, an effect that was attributed to the decreasing influence of edge delaminations in the larger test samples. The elastic modulus of the fiber-metal laminates did not exhibit any scale effect, remaining roughly constant over the four sizes of specimen considered here. ?? 2006.",

Observations show the boron/glass fiber prepreg, transverse to the loading direction, results in a bearing mechanism that effectively increases the bearing strength. The bearing strength of COBRA with longitudinal fibers is lower than that with transverse fibers due to the fact that shearout failure takes place before maximum bearing strength is reached. The experimental results show that, with only either transverse fiber orientation or longitudinal fiber orientation, COBRA with 18% boron fiber volume fraction possesses a higher bearing strength when compared to HFML with 6% boron fiber volume fraction.

          "abstract": "A moir?? interferometric investigation of surface strain redistribution due to matrix cracking around open holes in two [0/45/90/-45]s composite laminates with differing ply thicknesses was conducted. Both tests revealed significant redistribution of strain as damage developed. The results from the thicker-ply specimen show strain redistribution mostly due to the cracking of the top 0?? ply. This was verified by a mesh-independent displacement discontinuity modeling method based on higher order shape functions. Localized effects of sub-surface-ply cracking were not found. However, due to a thinner surface ply and more extensive damage, the thinner-ply specimen showed significant redistribution of strain as a result of the sub-surface-ply cracking as well as the 0?? ply cracking. Evidence of cracking in the center -45?? plies was present in the strain results. Examination of the strain redistribution and the failure surface of the thinner ply specimen led to the development of a failure scenario, where the initiation of critical 0?? fiber cracking occurs slightly away from the hole edge. Future modeling efforts will attempt to verify this scenario.",

The fatigue limits of the different composite lay-ups tested were successfully compared with data resulting from the self-heating test method on the same laminates. This comparison reveals a good agreement between the two methods dedicated to stress fatigue limit determination. In addition, a tomographic analysis is used to perform comparisons at the microscale between both fatigue methods.

When cyclic loading is present, the pre-fracture damage state is altered significantly, so that estimating strength (or residual strength) is greatly complicated. The present paper examines this complexity and attempts to assess the manner in which pre-fracture fatigue damage affects residual strength and the fracture event. It is found that the large strength reductions observed prior to failure at low load levels can be accounted for by internal stress redistribution and material degradation events. A careful chain of physical evidence in support of this approach is presented. ?? 1982.",

Previous work had modeled such variable stiffness laminae by taking a reference fiber path and creating subsequent paths by shifting the reference path. This paper introduces a method where subsequent paths are truly parallel to the reference fiber path. The primary manufacturing constraint considered in the analysis of variable stiffness laminates was limits on fiber curvature which proved to be more restrictive for parallel fiber laminae than for shifted fiber. The in-plane responses of shifted and parallel fiber variable stiffness laminates to applied uniform end shortening were determined. Both shifted and parallel fiber variable stiffness laminates can redistribute the applied load thereby increasing critical buckling loads compared to traditional straight fiber laminates. The primary differences between the two methods is that parallel fiber laminates are not able to redistribute the loading to the degree of the shifted fiber. This significantly reduces the increase in critical buckling load for parallel fiber variable stiffness laminates over straight fiber laminates.",

Carbon-epoxy laminates with fibre-dominated ([0]20 and [0/±45/90]5s) and matrix-dominated ([±45]10s) ply patterns were reinforced in the through-thickness direction with thin z-pins. The tensile elastic modulus of the laminates was not affected significantly by z-pins, however their tensile strength decreased at a linear rate with increasing pin content. The tensile fatigue life of both the fibre-dominated and matrix-dominated laminates was reduced by z-pins, although the mechanisms degrading the fatigue performance are different. The fatigue life of the fibre-dominated laminates was reduced by microstructural damage caused by z-pins, particularly fibre breakage, fibre waviness and resin-rich zones. The fatigue performance of the matrix-dominated laminate was degraded by cracking around the z-pins. The study reveals that the tensile fatigue life of carbon-epoxy is always reduced by z-pins regardless of the fibre pattern. However, the magnitude of the reduction in fatigue performance of z-pinned laminates is dependent on their fibre pattern. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "We present a three-dimensional (3-D) stress analysis for composite laminates with an elastically pinned circular hole. The effects of friction, bearing force and bypass loading on the stress redistribution are studied in detail. The numerical approach is based on a multilayer boundary element method (MLBEM), a non-traditional BEM particularly designed for anisotropic composite laminates, coupled with the traditional BEM for the pin filling the hole. The unique characteristic of the MLBEM is that the fundamental solution employs Green&#039;s functions that satisfy the interfacial continuity conditions and top- and bottom- surface traction-free and symmetry conditions. This fundamental solution allows us to design a BE scheme without involving discretization on the interfaces and surfaces unless the laminates are imposed by different boundary conditions. Consequently, in this case of pinned joint, only the hole surface among the composite boundary and interfaces needs to be discretized. A Coulomb-type friction law is used to simulate the frictional contact interaction between the composite and pin. To solve the frictional contact problem, an iterative scheme of successive over-relaxation has been proposed where the contact location and frictional contact condition are determined at the same time in the iteration solution. By applying the MLBEM, stress analyses are performed for a laminate plate with the stacking sequence (0/???45/90)s. The issues of engineering interests, such as the loading-sequence and cycling dependencies of stress state due to the presence of friction, are addressed. The solutions, shown by complicated contact maps and stress states around the hole, suggested that a 3-D approach to pinned composite joints is necessary for the interpretation of the underlying physics. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The response of the stitched GRP laminates to explosion loading at two shock levels was compared to a non-stitched laminate. The damage to the non-stitched and stitched laminates appeared to be similar, with both the polymer matrix and glass fibres experiencing cracking while some of the polymer/glass interfaces were delaminated. The damage occurred by the bending of the laminates under the pressure exerted by the shock wave. At a relatively low shock level, no significant damage to the Kevlar threads occurred, but at a higher shock level many of the threads were broken. The stitching was effective in reducing the spread of delamination damage, particularly when the stitch orientation was in the parallel direction and/or the stitch density was high. However, the stitches acted as stress concentrators under shock loading, resulting in a large amount of damage localised around the stitches. Measurements of the residual tensile strengths of the damaged laminates are presented. ?? 1996.",

Therefore, their fatigue behavior and modeling have been of much interest in recent years. This literature review presents a broad review of the many factors influencing cyclic deformation, fatigue behavior, and damage development in SFRPCs. These include microstructural related effects as well as effects related to loading condition and their service environment. Microstructural related effects include those related to fiber length, content and orientation, surface treatment, and failure mechanisms. Cyclic deformation and softening, viscous characteristics, and dissipative response used to characterize and model their fatigue damage behavior and accumulation are discussed. The effects of stress concentrations and their gradient on fatigue behavior are also discussed, due to their significant influence. The effects related to the loading condition include mean stress effects which may be accompanied by cyclic creep, variable amplitude loading, and multiaxial stress effects. Since fatigue behavior is substantially influenced by the testing frequency with self-heating as the primary consequence of increased frequency, this effect is also investigated. Environmental effects considered include the effects of moisture content and temperature, as well as thermo-mechanical fatigue behavior. The effect of welded joints in manufactured components made of SFRPCs and fatigue analysis and life estimation techniques used for such components are also included.",

Off-axis and angle ply specimens cut from laminates of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) reinforced with continuous carbon fibers have been tested under cyclic sinusoidal tensile loads and the hysteresis loops have been monitored. A micro mechanical model, which includes a parabolic criteria based on the plastic behavior of the matrix, has been adopted to study the composite non-linear behavior and a correlation between plastic deformation and a strong rise of damping and temperature at high stresses is outlined. Good agreement is shown between theory and experimental results.

These sheets were made of vapor grown carbon nanofibers. The composite laminates consisted of eight plies of CNS and eight plies of glass fiber mats. The fire retarding performance of the laminates was evaluated with cone calorimeter tests with an external radiated heat flux of 50 kW / m2. The test results indicated that there was significant improvement in the fire retardancy of composite laminates due to the incorporation of CNS. It was found that the CNS plies survived the test except the one on the top surface of the laminates. The formation of compact char materials was observed on the surface of the CNS residues. The improvement in fire retarding performance was achieved through the barrier and insulator effects of the CNS and charred materials by restricting the migration of flammable products to the top surface of the laminates and preventing the transmission of external heat to the underlying polyester resin. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

It is concluded that the inner original defects, which derived from the manufacturing process of composite laminates, are the common and major reason of causing the random distributions of the static strength and the fatigue life. And there is a correlative relation between the two distributions. With the study of statistical relationship between the fatigue loading and the fatigue life in the uniform confidence level and the same survival rate S-N curves of material, the relationship between the static strength distribution and the fatigue life distribution through a material S-N curve model has been obtained. And then the model which is used to describe the distributions of fatigue life of composites, based on their distributions of static strength, is set up. This model reasonably reflects the effects of the inner original defects on the static strength dispersion and on the fatigue life dispersion of composite laminates. The experimental data of three kinds of composite laminates are employed to verify this model, and the results show that this model can predict the random distributions of fatigue life for composites under any fatigue loads fairly well.",

The quality of the developed multiscale laminates was evaluated by non-destructive inspection techniques (ultrasonic C-scan and thermography), density measurements as well as optical and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The in-plane and transverse thermal and electrical conductivities as well as Short-Beam-Shear (SBS) strength were measured at different locations within each composite panel. It was found that the addition of SWCNT can have a considerable influence on the porosity of manufactured laminates. In summary, while unwrapped SWCNT generally improved the thermal and electrical properties of the PEEK/GF laminates, composites incorporating compatibilizer exhibited the lowest porosity, the highest electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The tensile properties of those composites with drilled holes were investigated. The measurements were taken from the residual tensile strength of impacted specimens and the open hole specimens. From there, the damage area of the composites could be predicted. It is found that the long kenaf composite was more notch sensitive than long kenaf/woven glass hybrid composite. The hybrid composite was stronger than long kenaf composite. However, the damage progression mechanisms in the two materials were similar. Failure for both kenaf composite and long kenaf/woven glass hybrid composite started around the hole. The polymer matrix failed initially followed by fibre–matrix debonding.",

The results showed that the damage modes can be categorized into fiber damage, resin deterioration, and internal delamination modes.

The effects of fiber misalignment variability, fiber clustering, load sharing rules on the damage in composite are studied numerically. It is demonstrated that the clustering of fibers has a negative effect of the damage resistance of a composite. Further, the static compressive loading model is generalized for the case of cyclic compressive loading, with and without microdegradation of the matrix, and with and without random variations of loading. It was observed that the random variations of loading shorten the lifetime of the composite: the larger the variability of applied load, the shorter the lifetime. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

With the presence of high crack-tip local stresses, the effect of inherently nonlinear composite material constitutive properties on the delamination becomes an interest and important issue. In this paper, a nonlinear anisotropic laminate elasticity formulation is introduced to establish governing field equations for a delamination between dissimilar fiber-composite plies. In the context of nonlinear fracture mechanics, the dominant stress singularity and asymptotic solution structure are determined for a delamination in a composite laminate with nonlinear ply constitutive properties. A computational method is used to analyze the delamination field in a composite with complex lamination variables. Delamination energy release rates associated with individual modes are obtained for symmetric angle-ply composite laminates for illustration. Several case studies are conducted to compare the solutions for nonlinear delamination problems with those of corresponding linear interface-crack problems. Unique features of nonlinear composite delamination mechanics are presented, including the order of stress singularity, coupled tearing-mode contributions, and large delamination closure due to strong ply material anisotropy, discontinuity and Poisson&#039;s effect. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "In the current investigation, damage resistance of stitched/unstitched S2-glass/epoxy composites is studied. Five layer stitched/unstitched plain weave S2-glass woven fabric composite laminates were manufactured using toughened SC15 epoxy resin system. For stitching, two configurations: one with 25.4 mm grid and other with 12.7 mm grid, were used with 6 mm pitch. Damage resistance was evaluated by subjecting 100 ?? 100 mm samples to low velocity impact loading at energy levels ranging 10-80 J using DYNATUP Model 8210, an instrumented impact test system. Three samples were tested at each energy level. The extent of damage was evaluated using ultrasonic C-scan. Results of the study indicate that stitching confined the damage size. As the damage was low over most of the energy range, the study was further extended to determine the effect of repeated impact loading. Under this study, laminates were subjected to repeated impact loading up to maximum of 40 impacts at energy levels ranging from 10 to 50 J. Results of repeated impact study are reported in terms of peak load, absorbed energy and projected damage area. All the laminates, sustained repeated impact loading up to 30 J. Beyond 30 J, laminates failed to carry repeated loading beyond certain numbers, which depended on the laminate configuration. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In FEA model, considering the scatter of the material&#039;s properties, each element was assigned with different material&#039;s properties. The stress analysis was carried out in MSC Patran/Nastran, and a modified Hashin&#039;s failure criterion was applied to predict the failure of the elements. A new stiffness degradation model was proposed and applied in the simulation and then a strength degradation model was deduced, which is coupled with the presented stiffness degradation model. The reduced or discounted elastic constants were determined based on the failure mechanism of the laminates and the restrictive conditions of orthotropic property. The fatigue behavior and fatigue life of six kinds of E-glass/epoxy composite laminates with different lay-up sequences were experimentally studied, and the S-N curves and stiffness degradation models in longitudinal, transverse and in-plane shear direction were obtained. These fatigue data were adopted in the simulation to simulate fatigue behavior and estimate life of the laminates. The simulation results, including the fatigue life predicted and the residual stiffness, were coincident with the experimental results well except for the quasi-isotropic laminate for the lack of consideration of the out-of-plane fatigue character in the simulation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Solution-pre-impregnated, unidirectional, carbon-fiber-reinforced poly(ether ether ketone) laminates prepared at different melt residual times were used as the experimental materials to obtain different interfacial effects and matrix morphologies. Composite crystalline structures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. The stress-intensity factor was measured by means of the single-edge-notched bending method along the two orthogonal directions of the laminates. The results indicate that the Mode-I fracture toughness along the fiber direction, K(IC)″, increases with a rise in melt residual time, while the stress-intensity factor at failure perpendicular to the fiber direction, K(is perpendicular to), changes with the melt residual time in a more complicated way. Through a careful comparison of the two stress-intensity factors with composite microstructure, the dependence of the fracture toughness on the crystalline morphology of the matrix resin has been found. That is, K(IC)(is perpendicular to) increases with increasing matrix crystallinity and K(IC)″ increases with either a decrease in the heterogeneous crystallization or an increase in the orientation of matrix crystallites. It is, thus, proved that the fracture toughness of the laminates depends on crystallinity and crystalline morphology of the matrix as well as the interfacial interaction, but not merely on matrix crystallinity.

Microscopic damage in short fiber reinforced composite are described by fiber failure and fiber/matrix interfacial debonding. Numerical methods are implemented to predict the fiber failure and failure in the fiber/matrix interface layer. Predictions of these types of failures have been applied to determine damages in each loading cycle. The work has been simulated adopting the concept of 3D unit cell models. The Weibull damage law is used to predict the microscopic damage behavior of composites taking into account the fiber volume fractions and orientation of fibers (0° and 90°) in the composite. By comparing the simulation with the experimental stress-strain curves for tension, the Weibull damage parameters are determined. Using these damage parameters a mesoscopic model of polymer matrix composites (PMCs) reinforced with 8.1 vol.% glass fibers including the effect of fiber-clusters is developed and the damage during cyclic loading is predicted.

The contact phenomenon is different in small and large indentation stages. which is due to occurrence of laminate damage. The contact force corresponding to the onset of laminate damage is found to be independent of the indentor size. In the small indentation stage where the plate is intact. the change of laminate stacking sequence has an insignificant effect on the force-indentation relationship. However. the force-indentor size relationship does not follow the modified contact law for thin laminates indented by large indentors. Beyond the small indentation stage, damage occurs. The size of the delamination area is proportional to the applied loads and the number of repeated loading cycles. The passage of the delamination crack front can be detected using strain gauges. Also. the indentation spring becomes stiffer under repeated loading. Finally, the delamination damage and the strain history in a laminate at lowvelocity impact are found to be very similar to those in the contact test except that vibration was observed in the impact test.",

The paper is limited to tape prepreg based monolithic laminates, although some similarities exist with impact damage in textile based laminates. Damage zones have a complex geometry with several damage types, which results in an interaction and competition between different failure mechanisms, e.g. local and global buckling, compressive failure, and delamination growth. Hence, simplified damage models may provide incorrect predictions of the failure load and failure mechanisms after impact. The constitutive behaviour of damage zones has been studied experimentally in tension and compression using an inverse method, and the results have been compared with detailed FE models of a generic impact damage. The paper is concluded with a discussion on analytical and computational models to predict the resulting strength of impacted laminates.",

This paper studies the effects of drilling parameters on the thrust force, adjusted delamination factor and compressive residual strength of uni-directional glass/epoxy resin. The design of the experiment was based on the Taguchi method. The results highlight the importance of the feed rate for maximizing the compressive residual strength of drilled laminates. The Acoustic Emission (AE) technique was also used to monitor both drilling process and compression test. The objective was to establish a correlation between AE parameters and mechanical characteristics.

The model assumes that the cracks in off-axis plies are uniformly distributed and a damage variable D is defined. Based on the theory of fracture mechanics, the elastic moduli of cracked matrix are obtained and indicated by the damage variable D, then the reduction of elastic moduli of laminates caused by the matrix cracks was studied.

          "abstract": "Through the application of a simple model, the concept of damage accumulation has been used to predict the fatigue life of TP-based composite materials at a test temperature higher than its glass transition temperature. This work was aimed at studying the off-axis tension-tension fatigue behavior of woven-ply C/PPS laminates which consists of three primary stages: (i) In the initial phase of cyclic loading, damage accumulates rapidly along with a matrix plasticization under the form of intra-laminar cracking which may initiate in multiple locations, but preferably at the interfaces between fibers and matrix at the crimps - (ii) The second stage is characterized by a steady damage growth rate and little damage accumulation - (iii) Damage (mostly debonding and interlaminar cracks) generalizes rapidly during the last stage ultimately resulting in extensive delamination and fiber bundles pull-out. It also appears that the fatigue behavior is ascribed to the highly ductile and time-dependent behavior of matrix-rich regions due to the non-planar structure of woven plies. Finally, a simple analytical model was applied, and proved to be adequate to capture the different stages of damage scenario, with excellent correlation to the experimental data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The accumulation of different damage modes has been assessed, as a function of number of cycles, using a three-dimensional fatigue progressive damage model (FPDM). The residual strength of the CFRP laminates has been assessed through the combined use of the FPDM with a static three-dimensional progressive damage model (PDM). By simulating the experimental procedure, the FPDM has been applied up to certain number of cycles, to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage and then, the static PDM has been applied (quasi-static tensile loading) to predict final tensile failure of the laminates, which corresponds to the residual strength of the laminate, after it has been exposed at the specific cycles. The models comprised the components of stress analysis performed using finite elements, failure analysis performed using polynomial stress-based failure criteria and material property degradation performed using degradation rules. The analysis has been validated experimentally (a) by assuming a laminate free of internal defects, and (b) by considering the initial defects, which were determined experimentally for certain laminates. The analysis has resulted in an accurate simulation of the experimentally determined fatigue damage accumulation and residual strength. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Then, a model based on Darcy&#039;s law for porous materials is developed for predicting gas permeability in composite laminates containing microcracks and delaminations. Gas permeability is presented as a function of crack density and crack intersection area.

This study consists of two parts. The first is related to the experimental analysis of the orthogonal cutting applied to unidirectional laminates in carbon/epoxy for various angles between the direction of fibers and the tool cutting direction (cutting speed). The second part concerns the numerical modeling of the orthogonal cutting in statics for the simple case of fibers orientated at 0° with respect to the tool&#039;s cutting direction. The experimental study of the cut highlights the great influence of the angle between the fiber orientation and the direction of cutting speed of the tool on the chip formation as well as the rupture modes. Numerical computation is based on the fracture process and more particularly on the computation of the energy release rate by the method Virtual Crack Extension (using the software, SAMCEF). It makes it possible to measure the influence of the geometry of the cutting tool and the depth of the cut on the cutting force. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The source can be external, involving acoustic wave loading as in the so called leaky Lamb wave experiment, and low-velocity foreign object impact on the surface of the structure, or internal, as in sudden crack initiation and its rapid growth from existing internal flaws. All three problems are of critical importance in the safe operation of composite structures, due to their vulnerability to hidden delaminations that can occur in composite materials when they are subjected to this type of loads. It is well known that both the dynamic surface loading associated with impact, and the sudden &quot;opening&quot; of an internal crack associated with the extension of a preexisting flaw act as sources of elastic waves in the material of the structure. The research reported here consists of model-based analysis of the guided waves generated by surface loading and microcrack initiation in graphite epoxy composite laminates commonly used in aircraft and aerospace structures. The objective of this study is to develop a mechanics based understanding of the causal relationship between the properties of the source and the characteristics of the waves generated by its initiation and propagation. The results of this research are expected to be useful in developing effective health monitoring systems for new as well as aging aircraft and aerospace structures. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The influence of stitching orientation and stitching density on the S-N curve of the laminate has also been investigated. The fatigue resistance was reduced considerably by stitching, particularly at relatively low fatigue stresses. Both the non-stitched and stitched laminates experienced similar types of fatigue damage, i.e. cracking of the vinyl ester resin matrix and glass fibres, and debonding between the matrix and fibres. However, the stitched laminates also suffered fatigue failure between the stitches and surrounding laminate, which contributed to the reduction in the fatigue lives of these materials. Their fatigue resistance was also reduced by damage to the glass fibres caused when the laminates were stitched. It was concluded that while stitching improved the interlaminar fracture properties of the GRP, it seriously degraded the fatigue performance. ?? 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Limited.",

Selected tests were carried out within a scanning electron microscope to ascertain the damage and fracture micromechanisms upon loading. The mechanical behavior of the notched beam was simulated within the framework of the embedded cell model, in which the actual composite microstructure was resolved in front of the notch tip. In addition, matrix and interface properties were independently measured . in situ using a nanoindentor. The numerical simulations very accurately predicted the macroscopic response of the composite as well as the damage development and crack growth in front of the notch tip, demonstrating the ability of the embedded cell approach to simulate the fracture behavior of heterogeneous materials. Finally, this methodology was exploited to ascertain the influence of matrix and interface properties on the intraply toughness. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Aligned nanoscale fibers have been shown to provide inter and intralaminar reinforcement of fiber-reinforced polymer composites. In one hierarchical architecture, aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on advanced microfibers in a woven ply creates a &#039;fuzzy fiber&#039; reinforced plastic (FFRP) laminate. Here, the mechanisms of Mode I fracture toughness enhancement for such laminates are elucidated experimentally by varying the type of epoxy and aligned CNT length. Reinforcement effectiveness is found to vary from reduced initiation toughness to over 100% increase in steady-state fracture toughness, depending upon the interlaminar fracture mechanisms. Fracture-surface morphology investigations reveal that interlaminar toughness enhancement is significantly less for an aerospace infusion resin than that for a much tougher hand lay-up marine epoxy. Long (~20 micron) aligned CNTs add significant toughness in steady state (&gt;1kJ/m2 increase for marine epoxy) via CNT pullout and by driving the crack through tortuous paths around and through microfiber bundles/tows, whereas shorter CNTs produce less toughening (or even reduced toughness in aerospace epoxy), which is attributed to increased microfiber-matrix cohesive failure. These findings reveal the multi-scale nature of the aligned-CNT reinforced composite ply interface, and the mechanisms at work at the micro and nanoscales that influence the macroscopic behavior. These new insights provide impetus for using aligned CNTs to tailor microfiber polymer composites by adjusting microfiber orientation, steering cracks through tortuous paths, and maximizing fracture surface area through both microfiber and nanofiber pullout. © 2014.",

The TM/basalt/epoxy laminates were fabricated by impregnating woven basalt fibers into epoxy resin mixed with TM particles via vacuum assisted resin transfer molding. Tensile and flexural tests were performed according to ASTM standards. Fracture surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The results showed significant improvement in both tensile and flexural strength and modulus when tourmaline particles where incorporated in the basalt/epoxy composite. The best result was obtained at 1 wt% TM loading with surfactant (i.e., C4) showing an increase of ???16% in both tensile and flexural strength, and 27.4% and 153.3% increase in tensile and flexural modulus, respectively, compared to neat basalt/epoxy composite. The enhanced performance of TM/basalt/epoxy laminates is attributed to a good dispersion of TM particles in the epoxy matrix providing increased surface area for strong interfacial interaction and good load transfer. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Correlations between actual test data and our nonlinear stress-strain response and failure envelope predictions under multi-axial loading for 12 different case studies are presented and discussed. Although our approach to modeling composite failure ranked high when applied to biaxial in-plane loading analysis, the theory does not consistently capture the inherent strengthening mechanisms that can be attributed to triaxial loading and hydrostatic pressure. It is expected that the incorporation of a strain-based ply-level failure criterion that introduces some form of strengthening mechanism under a three-dimensional stress state would significantly improve the accuracy of our predictions. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",

Constitutive models which take into account the physical progressive failure behaviour of fibres, matrix, and interfaces between plies were implemented in an explicit finite element method and used in the simulation of low-velocity impact events on composite laminates. The computational effort resulted in reliable predictions of the impact dynamics, impact footprint, locus and size of delaminations, matrix cracks and fibre damage, as well as the amount of energy dissipated through delaminations, intraply damage and friction.

Filament, yarn, and resin-impregnated strand test methods are discussed. Tensile strength theories for untwisted yarns (fiber bundles) and strands are summarized. A new theory for twisted fibrous structures, such as yarns and ropes, is presented. Predictions of the various theories are compared with test da ta for Kevlar®^ 49 a r amid. Standard flexural test procedures presented in ASTM Tests for Flexural Properties of Plastics and Electrical Insulating Materials (D 790) are reviewed, and it is shown analytically and experimentally that use of the shorter recommended span-todepth ratios can give artificially low modulus values. The importance of considering characteristic dimensions of material internal structure in selection of test coupon geometry, a topic ignored in most test methods, is discussed. This criterion is particularly important for fabric composites because yarn bundle size, an important characteristic dimension, can be large. The effects on mechanical properties of two types of common nonuniformities found in hand lay-up fabric laminates—resin surface layers and unequal layer thickness—are examined and found to be very significant. Finally, it is shown that there is an appa r ent effect of number of plies on flexural modulus which can be significantly reduced by modifying test da ta to account for resin surface layer.",

Drilling is an essential machining operation being used in composite industries for making of holes for bolted joints. The conventional drilling, which is frequently used for making holes in polymer–matrix composite parts, is not convenient anymore because of plethora of challenges encountered. The major drawback is the drilling-induced damage, which mainly occurs due to the direct interaction between the tool and composite laminate. Therefore, there exists a research opportunity to develop cost-effective high-quality machining methods for composite laminates. In the present research endeavor, rotary-mode ultrasonic drilling process has been conceptualized and developed for the drilling of fiber-reinforced polymer composites. The influence of various process parameters including power rating, slurry concentration, and abrasive size on material-removal rate, tool wear rate, and average surface roughness (Ra) has been experimentally investigated. It has been observed that the entry and exit delamination is prevented, and hole circumferential edge quality is improved when holes are produced through rotary-mode ultrasonic drilling as compared to the conventional drilling. It has also been found that with substantial modification in the conventional ultrasonic drilling process, the drilling performance in terms of material-removal rate of glass-epoxy laminates can be significantly improved. The major contribution of the present research endeavor is the development of a novel method of making clean-cut damage-free holes in fiber-reinforced composite laminates.",

These materials have high fatigue strength, low weight, good impact resistance etc. The present study characterizes the resistance to low-velocity impact in hybrid laminates based on aluminum alloys connected with carbon/epoxy composite (Al/CFRP) or glass/epoxy composite (Al/GFRP). Tested laminates were prepared by means of autoclave method in two kinds of configurations (2 (metal sheets) / 1 (composite inside) and 3/2). The laminates response to low velocity impact was analyzed on drop-weight test machine with hemispherical impactor (diameter 12.7 mm). The primary purpose of the study was to apply the rule of influence of the Metal Volume Fraction in laminates (MVF) on static mechanical properties but using dynamic load (low-velocity impact) for both types of laminates. The laminates were characterized in terms of a comparison of their impact resistance and according to different amount of metal layers with different energy levels. These results have been used to determine the damage area and maximum depth of deformation depending on layers configurations (metal volume fraction in laminate) under energy levels. It was noted that applied FMLs are innovative materials characterized by high low- velocity impact resistance because of superior properties of both metals and fibrous composite materials with a strong adhesive bonding. Moreover it was noted that general failure mechanism consists in matrix cracking and delaminations in polymer composite and on aluminum/composite interface. The conclusion has been drawn that there is no influence of metal volume fraction in laminate in case of dynamics loads. However, the MVF effect is apparent for one configuration in which MVF modeling is possible using different thicknesses of sheet metal and composite.",

          "abstract": "Residual stresses induced during the processing of thick composite laminates are analyzed. A two-dimensional thermochemical analysis is used to obtain temperature and degree of cure distributions during cure. A two-dimensional finite-element model is developed to predict the residual stress history in rectangular laminated plates. A cure-dependent viscoelastic material model is used in the analysis. Both unidirectional and cross ply laminates are investigated. Unidirectional laminates are studied because residual stresses in this class of laminates is driven purely by thickness effects. Regardless of the layup, for moderately thick (2.54-cm) laminates the nonuniformities in temperature and degree of cure are mild As a result, the development of residual stress is very similar to the analysis of thin laminates. For laminates of large thickness (7.5 cm) stronger variations in temperature and degree of cure develop during the cure cycle, The development of residual stress in this case is more complex. The transverse stress distribution in unidirectional laminates is tensile at the center and compressive on the edge at the end of cool-down. The profile is inverted twice during the cure cycle as competing mechanisms of thermal expansion, chemical shrinkage, and chemical hardening interact. The transverse residual stress for 7.5-cm-thick unidirectional laminates was shown to reach a value of 3.5 MPa after cure, compared to a value of only 0.65 MPa for 2.54-cm-thick laminates. In all of the cases analyzed the laminates exhibited a center-to-surface cure behavior. Thicker laminates and laminates constructed of materials with different cure kinetics could show a surface-to-center cure behavior, In such cases the residual stress development will be significantly changed from the results presented in this article.",

The major focus of the analytical work was to develop an effective methodology for assessing the delamination bearing strength of joints in finite composite laminates in conjunction with an accurate three-dimensional contact stress analysis via an efficient quasi-three-dimensional finite element procedure based on layerwise theory. The contact phenomena and stress distribution in the vicinity of joints in composite laminates are investigated in detail. The delamination bearing failure strengths of mechanically fastened joints in composite laminates are predicted using modified Ye-delamination failure criterion based on layerwise finite element contact stress analysis. The effects of stacking sequence and clamping pressure are considered. The accuracy and applicability of the proposed methodology are confirmed by comparisons to the referenced experimental data and previous investigations. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Usually polymer matrix laminates are made of individual plies with unidirectional fiber reinforcement laid upon each other with varying fiber orientations with respect to the thickness coordinate. Due to missing fiber reinforcement in the thickness direction, this results in poor through-thickness (out-of-plane) properties of composite laminates. One method to enhance the out-of-plane properties is the stitching of dry semi-finished fiber products in the thickness direction prior to the infusion of the resin. On the other hand, the insertion of stitching yarns in the thickness direction may affect the mechanical properties in the laminate plane such as stiffness and strength. To quantify the effect of structural through-thickness reinforcement in non-crimp fabric carbon fiber/epoxy laminates under uniaxial tension and compression loading an experimental study was carried out which included a systematic variation of the yarn diameter, the stitching pattern and direction as well as the load direction. The results showed a significant effect of the stitching on the in-plane Young&#039;s modulus which was attributed to local displacements of the in-plane fibers and changes in the fiber volume fraction. A finite element based unit-cell model was developed to estimate the elastic constants of structurally stitched non-crimp fabric laminates taking into consideration the yarn diameter, the stitching pattern and direction as well as the load direction. Depending on these parameters, local changes of the fiber volume fraction as well as regions with undisturbed and disturbed fiber orientations within the laminate plies are taken into account. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Lightweight thermoplastic-based fiber-metal laminates were developed based on a self-reinforced polypropylene and a glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene composite material with two sheets of aluminum alloy 2024-T3. The laminates were manufactured using a fast one step cold press manufacturing procedure. The mechanical behavior of the laminates was then investigated under tensile and fatigue loading conditions. The tensile properties of the plain aluminum, the composite materials, and the thermoplastic fiber-metal laminates (TFML) were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. The fatigue tests were also conducted under load control based on the ASTM E 466 standard procedure. Various loading cycles were employed for the fatigue tests in order to minimize the possibility of heat generation on the composite materials. Three different load levels were applied for the fatigue specimens with zero to max loading. Results have shown that the glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene hybrid systems exhibited higher fatigue strength than the self-reinforced polypropylene based fiber-metal laminates. Following this, a simple prediction method for fatigue life of the TFMLs has been introduced. It is clearly indicated that the stress ranges calculated using the proposed method for the monolithic AL2024-T3 and the TFMLs are very similar at the same cycles to failure.

          "abstract": "This paper deals with impact damage and permanent indentation modeling. A numerical model has been elaborated in order to simulate the different impact damage types developing during low velocity/low energy impact. The three current damage types: matrix cracking, fiber failure and delamination, are simulated. Inter-laminar damage, i.e. interface delamination, is conventionally simulated using interface elements based on fracture mechanics. Intra-laminar damage, i.e. matrix cracks, is simulated using interface elements based on failure criterion. Fiber failure is simulated using degradation in the volume elements. The originality of this model is to simulate permanent indentation after impact with a &quot; plastic-like&quot; model introduced in the matrix cracking elements. This model type is based on experimental observations showing matrix cracking debris which block crack closure. Lastly, experimental validation is performed, which demonstrates the model&#039;s satisfactory relevance in simulating impact damage. This acceptable match between experiment and modeling confirms the interest of the novel approach proposed in this paper to describe the physics behind permanent indentation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Impact fracture tests were performed by the WIF (wedge-insert-fracture) method with a SHPB (split Hopkinson pressure bar) system for accurate measurement of impact fracture toughness, while quasi-static fracture tests were performed by the DCB (double-cantilever-beam) method with a screw-driven testing machine. In the present composite laminates, the fracture toughness decreased stepwise with increasing loading rate showing a distinct rate-sensitive transition region and two rate-insensitive regions above and below. As a consequence of this stepwise characteristic, the crack growth behaviour varied with loading rate: in and below this transition region, the crack grew unstably accompanied by high-speed propagation and arrest; but above the transition region, the crack grew stably and continuously. This trend was well explained by a simple model incorporating the rate dependence of fracture toughness and the contribution of kinetic energy in the specimen during unstable crack propagation.",

Meshes were generated for three unique combinations of z-pin diameter and density. A laminated plate theory analysis was performed on several layups to determine the bi-axial stresses in the zero degree plies. These stresses, in turn, were used to determine the magnitude of the relative load steps prescribed in the FLASH analyses. Results indicated that increasing pin density was more detrimental to in-plane compression strength than increasing pin diameter. Compression strengths of lamina without z-pins agreed well with a closed form expression derived by Budiansky and Fleck. FLASH results for lamina with z-pins were consistent with the closed form results, and FLASH results without z-pins, if the initial fiber waviness due to z-pin insertion was added to the fiber waviness in the material to yield a total misalignment. Addition of 10% shear to the compression loading significantly reduced the lamina strength compared to pure compression loading. Addition of 50% shear to the compression indicated shear yielding rather than kink band formation as the likely failure mode. Two different stiffener reinforced skin configurations with z-pins, one quasi-isotropic and one orthotropic, were also analyzed. Six unique loading cases ranging from pure compression to compression plus 50% shear were analyzed assuming material fiber waviness misalignment angles of 0, 1, and 2 degrees. Compression strength decreased with increased shear loading for both configurations, with the quasi-isotropic configuration yielding lower strengths than the orthotropic configuration.",

Limitations of continuum representations of intra-ply damage and the effect of mesh orientation on the analysis predictions are discussed. It is shown that accurate prediction of matrix crack paths and stress redistribution after cracking requires a mesh aligned with the fiber orientation. Based on these results, an aligned mesh is proposed for analysis of the open-hole tension specimens consisting of different meshes within the individual plies, such that the element edges are aligned with the ply fiber direction. The modeling approach is assessed by comparison of analysis predictions to experimental data for specimen configurations in which failure is dominated by complex interactions between matrix cracks and delaminations. It is shown that the different failure mechanisms observed in the tests are well predicted. In addition, the modeling approach is demonstrated to predict proper trends in the effect of scaling on strength and failure mechanisms of quasi-isotropic open-hole tension laminates.",

This work is a study of the effect of delaminations in laminates with initial curvature. Initial curvature typically results in an increased buckling load and the hypothesis was that the reduction in compressive strength due to delamination would be less in a curved specimen than a flat one. Glass fibre reinforced plastic test laminates were manufactured containing artificial delaminations of different sizes and through thickness positions. The laminates were either flat or curved, where the plane of curvature was normal to the loading direction. Compressive load was applied to the laminates and measurements of out of plane displacements and failure loads were made. Contrary to expectations, the curved laminates gave lower failure loads than flat laminates, for the same delamination size and through thickness position. Finite element simulation was carried out to predict out of plane displacement and failure load, with failure being assessed using a maximum stress criterion. Good agreement between finite element predictions and experimental measurements of load versus deflection behaviour was observed for both flat and curved laminates. Ultimate failure loads were also well predicted for the flat laminates but relatively poorly for the curved laminates. The finite element predictions depend on modelling accurately the out of plane displacement behaviour, which was found to be very sensitive to the boundary conditions for the case of curved laminates. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The course of experiments began with the fabrication of specimens using unidirectional CFRP prepreg materials. As-fabricated specimens were exposed to two types of hygrothermal conditions which were designed to simulate in-service environment. Microstructure characterization of the specimens revealed that neither hygrothermal conditions brought about any evident defects to the laminates. Low-velocity impact testing was then carried out on the specimens with different moisture levels. It was found for the first time that moisture significantly alleviated impact induced damage in the CFRP unidirectional laminates. Detailed discussion about how the absorbed moisture influenced the impact behavior of the laminate was carried out based on the interpretation of the damage characteristics and impact testing data. The effects of absorbed moisture on the GIC of this material were explored to assist the understanding of the role played by the absorbed moisture during low-velocity impact testing.",

The natural frequencies of fatigue-damaged laminates under extensional loading are related to the fatigue life of the laminates by establishing the equivalent flexural stiffness reduction as a function of the elastic properties of sublaminates. In particular, the stiffness degradation in 90° laminae is recast by exploring the 90°-ply elastic modulus reduction, and by using the concept of a linear fracture mechanism for the cracks in 90° plies, where the crack-growth displacement is defined to give the correct average crack density in the cross-ply laminate. This crack density is then used in the stiffness reduction model. The flexural stiffness is derived by relating the 90°-ply elastic modulus reduction, and using the laminate plate theory to the degraded elastic modulus and the intact elastic modulus of other laminae. The natural-frequency reduction model, in which the dominant fatigue mode can be identified from the sensitivity scale factors of su-blaminate elastic properties, provides natural frequency vs. fatigue curves for the composite laminates. Vibration tests were also conducted on [90°_2=0°_2]s carbon/epoxy laminates to verify the natural-frequency reduction model. Correlations between the predictions of the model and experimental results are good.",

The aim of this work is to present a novel technique to measure the adjusted delamination factor (Fda) using digital analysis. An experimental design is proposed for drilling FRP laminates under distinct cutting conditions. The digital analysis of the damage was conducted in order to assess the delamination factor.

Machining parameters for the damage-free drilling of these materials were established together with semi-empirical relationships between drilling forces and cutting parameters. The drilling force responses as a function of various feed rates and drill sizes were characterized to define the key process stages taking place during a drilling cycle. Using a previously established delamination-based criterion for initiating damage during drilling, the critical feed rate for damage-free drilling was established for the two composite material types: aramid and carbon fiberreinforced polymer laminates. Independent measurements of the opening-mode delamination crack energy release rates were conducted on both materials to determine the critical thrust force for damage initiation. This study establishes the key process stages exhibited by carbon and  aramid fiber composites during drilling, the critical threshold feed rates to avoid damage, and machining relations that can be utilized for the design of intelligent controllers for efficient drilling of composite laminates",

The reinforcement volume employed was in the order of 21-23% throughout. Laminates based exclusively on basalt, hemp and flax fibres were also fabricated for comparison. Hybrid laminates showed an intermediate performance between basalt fibre reinforced laminates on the high side, and flax and hemp fibre reinforced laminates on the low side. As for impact performance, GHB appears to be the worst performing hybrid laminate and FHB slightly overperforms GFB. In general, an increased rigidity can be attributed to all hybrids with respect to flax and hemp fibre composites. The morphological study of fracture by SEM indicated the variability of mode of fracture of flax and hemp fibre laminates and of the hybrid configuration (FHB) containing both of them. Acoustic emission monitoring during post-impact flexural tests confirmed the proneness to delamination of FHB hybrids, whilst they were able to better withstand impact damage than the other hybrids.",

Evaluation and characterization of defects and damage require experience and good understanding of the composites. Under low-velocity impact loading delamination is observed to be a major failure mode. In this paper, the results of extensive experimental work on damage of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates due to low-velocity impact are presented. The study was carried out on 10 different layups over four different thickness. Both drop-weight and projectile impacts simulating practical conditions like tool-drop and runway debris, respectively, were carried out at energy levels varying from 3 to 30 J. The ensuing delamination damage was determined by ultrasonic: C-scans using the pulse-echo immersion method for both projected and layer-wise distribution. While projected delamination was obtained by placing a gate over the backwall echo, layerwise distribution was obtained by successive time delay from the frontwall to the backwall echo covering each interface. Delamination areas were quantified accurately by processing the raw image data using a digital image processing technique. Based on the data obtained an empirical relation was established between the delamination area and the impact energy.",

Emphasis is placed on following damage development at the non-crimp fabric ply-level by investigating the influence of voids on damage accumulation, most notably transverse cracking and delamination. Details from experiments include micrographs of voids taken in both scanning-electron and light microscopy, measurements of void content and crack density using light microscopy, and stiffness plots from both quasi-static and cyclic tests. The stiffness results are compared with theoretical predictions accounting for transverse cracks. Voids have a significantly more detrimental effect on the mechanical properties in cyclic loading compared with quasi-static loading. Specifically, the stiffness reduction development, the underlying transverse cracking in layers and the number of cycles to failure are affected. Quality control by only quasi-static testing for void-containing composite materials to be used in components subjected to fatigue cannot therefore be recommended.",

Matrix cracking is modeled by the smeared crack method, which permits a crack description in terms of stress-strain relations and stiffness reduction in particular orientations. The modeling of material nonlinearity, damage initiation and growth, and the multiaxial loading with appropriate periodic boundary conditions are successfully incorporated in a FEM analysis. As examples of this unified analysis procedure, numerical results for unidirectional, angle-ply, and cross-ply laminates are presented.

Monotonic tensile tests performed on [0(3)/90(3)](S) laminates at 120 degrees C have shown a marked dependence of cracking development on loading rate. This paper aims to assess the impact of the material nonlinearity on the loading rate sensitivity of the damaging process. A &quot;shear-lag&quot; damage analysis, using the nonlinear correspondence principle and appropriate failure criteria, is carried out to numerically predict the cracking evolution. This work shows that, though important, the material nonlinearity of the undamaged material does not significantly enhance the loading rate sensitivity of the cracking process and it cannot explain alone the phenomenon. On the other hand, taking into account the loading rate dependence of the critical strength, together with the R-curve effect, which gives good predicted cracking curves, suggests that the observed rate effect pertains to the viscoelastic character of the damaged material in the process zone close to crack fronts.

          "abstract": "Fibre reinforced plastics (FRP), are important structural materials. The high degree of intricacy in composite structures necessitates special process to create holes in them for the purpose of assembly. Numerous methods have been used, but conventional drilling still remains the unavoidable process for making holes in composite laminates. FRPs are blended mixtures of two or more constituents whose properties differ substantially. The difference in elastic modulii, coefficient of thermal expansion etc of constituents results in a considerable shift in the material response to the drilling process, as compared to the behaviour of isotropic material. Moreover, the complexities resulting due to the variable fibre orientation and the stacking sequence makes drilling even more challenging. Drilling induced damage is an area of prime concern. A number of theoretical and experimental endeavours have been made to study the influence of various parameters on drilling induced damage in FRP laminates. Different damage mechanisms have been conceptualized and methodologies to avoid damage are proposed. The present study is an attempt to review the status of work done till date in drilling of composite materials with emphasis on damage mechanisms and to report initial experimental findings in drilling of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composite laminates.",

As the input for the model, the material properties (residual stiffness, residual strength and fatigue life) of unidirectional AS4/3501-6 graphite/epoxy material are fully characterized under tension and compression, for fiber and matrix directions, and under in-plane and out-of-plane shear in static and fatigue loading conditions. An extensive experimental program, by using standard experimental techniques, is performed for this purpose. Some of the existing standard testing methods are necessarily modified and improved. To evaluate the progressive fatigue damage model, fatigue behaviour of pin/bolt-loaded composite laminates is simulated as a complicated example. The model is validated by conducting an experimental program on pin/bolt-loaded composite laminates and by comparison with experimental results from other authors. Different capabilities of the model are examined by conducting different types of experiments. The comparison between the analytical results and the experiments shows the successful simulation capability of the model.",

          "abstract": "A new approach for modelling the post-fatigue strength and stiffness of notched fibre composite laminates has been developed. It is based on the observation of notch tip damage which can be quantified by the extent of the individual failure processes, splitting in the 0-degrees plies and delamination between the 0-degrees ply and off-axis plies. The notch tip damage zone grows stably under tensile cyclic loading in a self-similar manner and the size and shape of this damage zone is dependent on laminate geometry and constituent properties of the fibre, matrix and interface. The post-fatigue strength and stiffness of the laminate can be related uniquely to the split length, which defines the extent of damage growth. In this first paper in a series of four, observation is made and measurements taken of the damage growth mechanisms that make up the damage zone in carbon fibre/epoxy laminates. Radiographs are used to characterise the notch tip damage zone and to establish a qualitative relationship between post-fatigue strength (or stiffness), cyclic stress, damage size and numbers of cycles.",

The laminates were transverse and longitudinal unidirectional glass fibre-epoxy and carbon fibre epoxy laminates, and hybrid crossply laminates with longitudinal glass fibre-epoxy and transverse carbon fibre-epoxy layers. The temperature decreased linearly with increased tensile stress in the elastic region, except for longitudinal carbon fibre specimens (where the fibres have a small but negative coefficient of thermal expansion), which exhibited a small temperature increase. The occurrence of non-linear stress-strain behaviour in transverse carbon fibre specimens altered the rate of temperature change.

Furthermore, in order to maintain material frame indifference of the constitutive equations, the polar stress rate approach was employed in the stress and strain transformations for large rotations. The above physics were incorporated into the SPH. Detailed penetration process and damage progression were simulated with graphite/epoxy laminates impacted by a steel projectile.

Twelve large-scale (4.88 m in length) doubly reinforced concrete beams were strengthened with externally-bonded CFRP sheets and tested.

The objective of this work is to identify the main micro-mechanisms which govern the fatigue behavior of a short glass fiber reinforced polyamide composite through a multi-scale experimental analysis. Tension-tension fatigue tests have been performed at different applied maximum stress and have been analyzed at both microscopic and macroscopic scale. Together with the progressive loss of stiffness, the temperature rise during cyclic loading has been measured using an infrared camera. Moreover, SEM observations have been performed on the fracture surfaces. The analysis of the results shows that the fatigue strength is a consequence of two principal mechanisms: matrix temperature rise and fiber-matrix interface damage. Micro-ductile areas have been observed around the fibers. A statistical quantitative analysis relates the size of these very deformed areas to the maximum applied stress. Moreover, it has been shown that damage can appear only after a stabilization of the temperature. Finally, the multi-scale analysis allows relating the stress threshold for each mechanism to the S-N curves. The effects of the frequency and of the mean stress have been also evaluated. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

We investigated the damage and plasticity induced by the addition of carbon nanotubes to the matrix of a glass fiber/epoxy composite system. We characterized both the modified epoxy resin and the associated modified laminates using classical mesoscale analysis. We used dynamic mechanical analysis, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and classical mechanical testing to characterize samples with different concentrations of nanofillers. Since the samples were prepared using the solvent evaporation technique, we also studied the influence of this process.

Micrographs revealed uniform dispersion of O-CNFs in epoxy, good adhesion between O-CNFs and epoxy polymer, and improved interfacial bonding between fiber/matrix that lead to the stronger shift of the impact resistance of the hybrid composites.",

A vector damage description is used to represent evolving modes of damage associated with certain orientations of brittle cracking of the matrix material. A simple maximum strain criterion is used for fiber breakage with no allowance for evolution. Phenomenological damage evolution equations are postulated in terms of the current state of damage, stress above a current threshold, and material properties controlling evolution rates, resulting in implicitly rate-dependent response. Specific threshold and evolution functions are postulated and used to illustrate the predictive capability of the model for homogeneous deformation fields. A comparison of results to available experimental data for rate-dependent behavior of graphite/epoxy laminated composites shows good agreement.",

Polished thin sections removed from plain glass fiber/nylon composites and their corresponding fiber-metal laminates indicated that the prevailing microstructure was strongly dependent on the rate of cooling from the melt. Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture tests on the plain glass fiber reinforced nylon laminates indicated that the values of GIc and GIIc averaged approximately 1100 J/m2 and 3700 J/m2 respectively at all cooling rates. The degree of adhesion between the aluminum alloy and composite substrates was investigated using the single cantilever beam geometry. Here, the measured values of Gc were similar in magnitude to the Mode I interlaminar fracture energy of the composite, tending to increase slightly with increasing cooling rate. The tensile and flexural fracture properties of the plain composites and the fiber metal laminates were found to increase by between 10% and 20% as the cooling rate was increased by two orders of magnitude. This effect was attributed to over-aging of the aluminum alloy plies at elevated temperature during cooling. Finally, fiber metal laminates based on glass fiber/nylon composites were shown to exhibit an excellent resistance to low velocity impact loading. Damage, in the form of delamination, fiber fracture, matrix cracking in the composite plies, and plastic deformation and fracture in the aluminum layer, was observed under localized impact loading. Here, the fast-cooled fiber metal laminates offered superior post-impact mechanical properties at low and intermediate impact energies, yet very similar results under high impact energies.",

A three-dimensional computational micro-mechanics framework, with a special focus on the elastic–plastic and damage constitutive behaviours of the matrix and on the response of the fibre–matrix interface, is used in the present analysis. Varying the 90° ply thickness, it is possible to assess its effect on the mechanical response of laminated composites — the in situ effect. The proposed framework is able to accurately represent the micro-mechanical response of ultra-low grades, including (i) the mechanics of transverse cracking onset and propagation, (ii) the constraining effect observed in the laminae embedded in multidirectional laminates, (iii) the gradual, slow stress relaxation and progressive transverse cracking observed in very thin plies, and consequent increase of the crack density, (iv) the reduction in crack-opening displacement of the transverse cracks with ply thinness, (v) the formation of thin necks of matrix material around the regions where interfacial damage is more pronounced, and (vi) the in situ strengths.",

The models are based on simplified one-dimensional formulations and describe the impacted face of the sandwich as a set of Timoshenko beams joined by cohesive interfaces and resting on a nonlinear Winkler foundation, which approximates the response of the core; the dimensionless formulation highlights the material/structure groups that control the mechanical response. The characteristic features of the problem and transitions in damage progression are explored on varying geometrical parameters and material properties and magnitude and duration of the applied load. For quasi-static loading and low velocity impact, core/face-sheet interactions generate energy barriers to the propagation of delaminations; the efficacy of the barriers in controlling damage in the face-sheets depends on the relative stiffnesses of face-sheet and core and on the foundation yielding strength. For dynamic loading conditions, significant dynamic effects arise in certain regimes and cause substantial changes in behavior: shielding of the crack tip stress fields provided by the foundation is reduced, especially after the load is removed when important delamination openings occur; core plasticity generally opposes this behavior and limits damage in the face-sheet. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The quasi-static contact test was performed using a 12.7 mm hemispherically-tipped indentor. On the other hand, impact was conducted using a gas gun with projectiles of the same frontal shape weighing 8.7 g, 17.7 g and 35.5 g. The test speeds were from several m/s to the ballistic limits of the laminates. The impact response was measured using the self-developed laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) system and was subsequently converted into the force and displacement histories. Significant loading rate effects were observed when comparing the laminates loaded quasi-statically to those struck by projectiles with a four-fold difference in mass. These effects included differences in the impact force history, a drastic increase of the force peak and the absorbed energy, and a completely different delamination damage pattern. Thus, the loading rate effect for composite laminates reinforced by glass fibers cannot be overlooked. On the other hand, fiber breakage throughout the plies on the distal side of laminates was found to absorb a significant amount of impact energy. The absorbed energy versus the initial projectile energy for the dynamically loaded specimens, when plotted in a non-dimensionalized manner, was found to have a bilinear relationship regardless of the projectile mass employed. This bilinear line was also closely bounded from below by the quasi-static results.",

Finally, the dent depth vs. indentation force curve was predicted based on Turner&#039;s contact theory. The numerical results indicate that the dent initiation is induced by the matrix cracking and delamination, and the transition to rapid increase in dent depth is due to the fiber breakages.

Research and design guidelines concluded that externally bonded FRP could increase the capacity of RC elements efficiently. However, the linear stress-strain characteristics of FRP up to failure and lack of yield plateau have a negative impact on the overall ductility of the strengthened RC elements. Use of hybrid FRP laminates, which consist of a combination of either carbon and glass fibers, or glass and aramid fibers, changes the behaviour of the material to a non-linear behaviour. This paper aims to study the performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened by hybrid FRP laminates. This paper presents an experimental program conducted to study the behaviour of RC beams strengthened with hybrid fiber reinforced polymer (HFRP) laminates. The program consists of a total of twelve T-beams with overall dimensions equal to 460 ?? 300 ?? 3250 mm. The beams were tested under cyclic loading up to failure to examine its flexural behaviour. Different reinforcement ratios, fiber directions, locations and combinations of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates were attached to the beams to determine the best strengthening scheme. Different percentages of steel reinforcement were also used. An analytical model based on the stress-strain characteristics of concrete, steel and FRP was adopted. Recommendations and design guidelines of RC beams strengthened by FRP and HFRP laminates are introduced. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, the behavior of unnotched and open-hole unidirectional carbon epoxy crossply laminates under various off-axis biaxial tension-compression loadings is studied using a mixed experimental and numerical approach. Strain measurements made using digital image correlation technique in cruciform test specimens show overall good correlation with finite element predictions based on the micromechanics of failure theory and material property degradation method. It is shown that an aligned mesh concept where element edges are aligned with ply fiber direction is necessary for accurate prediction of progressive failure patterns. The finite element model is shown to be capable of predicting critical and sub-critical damage mechanisms governing failure in these laminates. Furthermore, the detrimental effect of off-axis loading and the introduction of an open-hole in carbon epoxy crossply laminates under the biaxial loading are investigated quantitatively.",

To develop the nanocomposite laminates, a spraying technology was used to deposit nanotubes on both sides of each four-harness satin weave carbon fiber fabric piece for the 12 ply laminate lay up. For these experimental studies the carbon fiber reinforced epoxy laminates were fabricated using a heated vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (H-VARTM??) method followed by a 2 soak curing cycle. The f-CNTs toughened the epoxy resin-fiber interfaces to mitigate the evolution of fiber/fabric-matrix interfacial cracking and delamination under both static and cyclic loadings.

          "abstract": "In this study, progressive matrix cracking damage analyses are performed for general symmetric laminate with any number of plies under in-plane tensile/shear loading condition. To predict initiation and evolution of matrix cracking in each layer of such laminate, an advanced numerical tool is developed here. The tool consists of, (i) a micromechanic-based damage model to find stiffness reduction of the laminate and damage parameters due to the presence of matrix cracking, (ii) an energy-based evolution law to predict initiation and progression of the damage and (iii) a finite element (FE) basement to implement the constitutive damage law analyzing laminates under complex boundary conditions. The stress transfer method is used to find the displacement and stress fields in a unit cell confined between two consecutive matrix cracks. Then, the degradation of elastic constants and damage parameters are calculated for each damaged layer of the laminate. New formulation is also developed to implement the evolution law at integration points to eliminate the length dependency of the energy-based damage criterion. The crack density is used as the only state variable which controls the damage state. An eight node element is developed using the full layerwise plate theory and the damage constitutive law is implemented in the formulation of a user defined element routine in Abaqus commercial software. The developed procedure is validated favorably with published experimental and numerical results for matrix cracking damage mechanism in general symmetric laminates. Concurrent progressive damage analyses in different plies of various laminates are also investigated and some results which are rarely available in the literature are presented in this paper. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Fracture mechanisms under fatigue loading were assessed in the case of nylon fiber-reinforced elastomer matrix composite which represents the actual carcass of bias aircraft tires.  Under uniaxial tension, the angle-plied carcass composite specimens were subjected to a considerably large interply shear strain before failure.  The composite specimens exhibited semi-infinite fatigue life when stress amplitude was below a threshold level, i.e., fatigue endurance limit.  Under cyclic stresses exceeding the endurance limit, localized damage in the form of fiber-matrix debonding and matrix cracking was formed and developed into delamination eventually leading to gross failure of the composite.  The process of damage accumulation was accompanied by heat generation and a continuous increase of cyclic strain (dynamic creep).  Fatigue lifetime and the resistance to damage accumulation of aircraft tire carcass composite were strongly influenced by cyclic frequency.  The use of higher cyclic frequency resulted in shorter fatigue lifetime at a given stress amplitude and lower fatigue endurance limit.  The extent of dynamic creep at gross failure, which is defined as the increase of cyclic strain beyond initial elastic deformation, was roughly independent of stress amplitude under the frequency of 1 Hz, but decreased with higher stress amplitude when the frequency was raised to 10 Hz.  Obviously a critical level of dynamic creep exists for gross failure of the composite and this level appears to be independent of the stress amplitude at low frequency.  When the frequency is high enough, heat generation due to hysteretic loss is expected to degrade the materials.  In this situation, the critical level of dynamic creep for gross failure may be reduced by the loss of matrix flexibility as well as fiber-matrix bonding strength.  The study also examined the effect of load sequence on the damage accumulation process of composite based on dual stress level fatigue testing.  Palmgren-Miner&#039;s linear damage accumulation theory tended to overestimate the cumulative damage of angle-plied carcass composites.  As an alternative to Palmgren-Miner&#039;s rule, a linear cumulative damage model based on dynamic creep was utilized.  The sum of dynamic creep to gross failure was found to be unity indicating that the level of cumulative damage is independent of the load sequence.",

The laminates under consideration have a symmetric layup, and are subjected to mechanical loads. The individual plies are elastic, have a unidirectional reinforcement, and can suffer local damage at the fiber/matrix interface when the resolved normal and shear stresses exceed their ultimate magnitudes. The local fields in the plies are assumed to be periodic, and are approximated by the finite element method for overall loads and local resolved stresses that are in excess of the interface strength. Local effects in the individual plies are scaled up to the laminate analysis through stress transformation factors, which are a function of the elastic properties of the plies and their stacking configuration. The proposed analysis was implemented for a periodic array model of the laminas, and for in-plane loading of the laminate. The model predictions for a unidirectional steel/epoxy system subjected to transverse loading compare remarkably well with experimental measurements. This result, and several other examples given for axial and off-axis loading of SiC/CAS laminates, illustrate the model capabilities in predicting the overall strains in the presence of simultaneous, progressive debonding in the individual plies. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This complements the work done by numerous other researchers who have also examined low velocity impact of composites, but have focused on unidirectional, cross-ply or quasi-isotropic laminates. In the present study, post-impact static uniaxial tension, compression, as well as tension-compression fatigue tests are performed. The damage mechanisms for woven laminates are found to be predominantly delamination and fiber breakage, with the area of impact-induced delamination increasing linearly with impact energy for the range of energies examined. Damage extent and type are also dependent on the curvature of the impactor tip and deformation generated by a sharp impactor is more localized. The existence of a threshold energy level below which no delamination discernible by C-scan occurs is noted. In contrast with previous findings, it is observed that the peak in the impactor deceleration-time response is not associated with the onset of fiber failure, which can occur earlier. The amount of energy absorbed when this peak occurs therefore does not indicate the energy required to initiate fiber breakage. It is observed that residual tensile strength is a function of delamination area and impactor tip radius. For static compression and tension-compression fatigue, the residual load-bearing capacity is only dependent on delamination area. Under compression, delamination promotes the micro-buckling of fibers, whereas in tension, failure is predominantly via fiber breakage. For a common impact energy and impactor, a damaged specimen is weaker in compression than in tension.",

Emphasis is placed on the determination of ballistic limits of these composites. To this end, an experimental program is carried out and a computational model, with progressive damage modeling capabilities, is developed using LS-DYNA. Experiments are performed whereby striking velocities are measured, via high-speed photography, to determine the ballistic limits of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates of various stacking sequences. The results are reproduced closely by a numerical simulation, indicating that the numerical analysis conducted, including the choice of material model and contact definition, is an accurate means for modeling the high-speed impact characteristics of CFRP laminates. It is found that the use of static elastic and strength properties to describe the material is reasonable, since strain rate effects are found to be negligible. The kinetic energy of the projectile, plotted over the simulated impact duration, is used as the prime parameter to compare the experimental and numerical results. The numerical results accurately predict the experimental ballistic limit for six of the seven tested laminate stacking sequences. Failure due to delamination is found to play a vital role with respect to the energy absorbing ability and lamina stacking sequence of CFRP laminates. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A theoretical analysis of cyclic fatigue damage and associated anisotropic property degradation in a random short-fiber composite is presented. The fatigue damage takes various forms of microcracking, originated from microscopic stress concentrators in the highly heterogeneous material system. A probabilistic treatment of the microcracks is introduced to evaluate the statistical nature of the microscopic fatigue damage. Damage evolution and accumulation are analyzed through the development of probabilistic density functions of microcrack length and orientation during the cyclic loading history. Constitutive equations for the damaged fiber composite are then derived on the basis of a self-consistent mechanics scheme in conjunction with a three-dimensional elliptic crack theory and the microcrack density functions. Cyclic fatigue degradation and associated damage-induced anisotropy of composite material properties are determined and checked against experiments. The tensorial nature of material damage and composite stiffness changes during fatigue are evaluated explicitly. A power-law relationship between the rate of damage growth and the fatigue loading cycle is obtained. The rate of fatigue damage growth is found to decrease exponentially with load cycles-a phenomenon unique to the random short-fiber composite. This study provides a comprehensive analytical treatment of the homogeneous fatigue damage problem for random short-fiber composites. The fundamental mechanics and mechanisms of fatigue damage evolution and associated anisotropic property degradation of the composite are elucidated. ?? 1986.",

          "abstract": "In the initial period of the life in the composite laminates, the principal types of damage are diffused ones, such as matrix crack, diffused fiber breaking and local delamination. On account of these diffused damages, a synergistic damage mechanic model was proposed for the stiffness properties. The model included the microcosmic responses of the physical damage and macroscopic performance of the material&#039;s stiffness. In micro-level, mesoscopic RVE(representative volume element) model was established to obtain crack opening displacement and crack sliding displacement, which were used to define the damage tensor. In macrolevel, through homogenizing the material strain and the surface displacement of the damage, the relationship of the stiffness matrix of unidirectional laminate or laminates in damage statue and damage tense was set up. Due to restriction of NDT (nondestructive testing) technology development, only the constitutive relations of matrix cracks were constructed. The influences of the transverse matrix cracks on the stiffness properties of the laminates [0/??45]s was analyzed with the present model and showed that it is capable to predict the reduction of the stiffness properties resulted from the fatigue diffused damage in the laminates. ?? 2014 The Authors.

In the present article, efficiency, accuracy, strengths and limitations of this method in predicting and discretely optimizing impact response of FRP composites have been studied through a case study on polypropylene/E-glass laminates with unidirectional, plain, and twill weave architectures. In parallel, drop weight impact tests, X-ray micro-tomography, and pre- and post-impact four-point flexural testing are employed for two purposes: (a) gaining further knowledge on induced impact damage mechanisms, and (b) further assessment and verification of the Taguchi results. In spite of the fact that impact events of the FRP laminates are highly nonlinear and accompany high level of uncertainty, it was found that this design of experiments method is capable of predicting and maximizing the absorbed impact energy with a reduced number of runs and reasonable error. Finally, by correlating macro-level predictions to micro-level damage observations via X-ray tomography, the underlying assumptions of the method were further scrutinized, and in particular it was found that the plies interaction effect is not a limiting factor in predicting the total absorbed energy of the laminates. Overall, the experimental time/cost saving in the performed impact optimization case study was over 50% using the Taguchi L9 orthogonal array.",

          "abstract": "A novel element-failure method (EFM) has been used with a recently proposed micromechanics-based failure criterion SIFT for the modeling of progressive damage in composite laminates. The element-failure concept is a potentially practical method for the modelling of damage, fracture and delamination in fiber-reinforced composite laminates. When the modeled damage is propagating within a finite element, the element is considered to have partially failed, but not removed from the computations. Consequently, only a fraction of the stresses that were computed before the damage entered the element contribute to the nodal forces of the element. The concept is especially useful when extended to composite structures because the nature of damage in composite laminates is generally diffused, characterized by multiple matrix cracks, fiber pullout, fiber breakage and delaminations. It is usually not possible to identify crack tips in the fashion of traditional fracture mechanics. Since parts of a damaged composite structure are often able to partially transmit load despite the presence of some damage, it is advantageous to model the damaged portions with partially failed elements. The damage may be efficiently modeled and tracked using element-failure concepts, with the application of appropriate failure criteria and damage evolution laws. The idea is to embody the effects of damage into the effective nodal forces of the finite element. Here, we report the novel use of element-failure concepts with a recently proposed composites failure criterion called the strain invariant failure theory (SIFT) in the prediction of damage progression and delamination in a composite laminate subjected to three-point bend. The predicted damage propagation patterns are in good agreement with experimental observation when the EFM is used with SIFT. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The residual compression strength is a function of the adhesion quality at the fiber/matrix interface. The cyclic-dynamic tests have shown that the dynamic strength under tensional loading is qualitatively comparable to the results of the compression-after-impact test with respect to the examined materials. The dynamic stiffness of the plates is significantly reduced in the case of poor fiber/matrix adhesion compared to the specimen with good and medium adhesion. The damage growth in the impacted plates during the cyclic-dynamic testing is also a function of the adhesion quality. The stiffness decreases and the energy absorption increases much faster in the case of poor fiber/matrix adhesion which indicates the poor damage tolerance of these laminates.

Drilling is often necessary to assemble different components, but this can lead to various forms of damage, such as delamination which is the most severe. However, a reduced thrust force can decrease the risk of delamination. In this work, two variables of the drilling process were compared: tool material and geometry, as well as the effect of feed rate and cutting speed. The parameters that were analyzed include: thrust force, delamination extension and mechanical strength through open-hole tensile test, bearing test, and flexural test on drilled plates. The present work shows that a proper combination of all the factors involved in drilling operations, like tool material, tool geometry and cutting parameters, such as feed rate or cutting speed, can lead to the reduction of delamination damage and, consequently, to the enhancement of the mechanical properties of laminated parts in complex structures, evaluated by open-hole, bearing, or flexural tests.",

Specimens were subjected to different fatigue loading, with the initial maximum load level up to 85% of the laminate ultimate flexural strength, and damage in the laminate was continuously monitored through the loss of bending moment during cycling. After 106 cycles the fatigue test was stopped and residual properties were measured on tested specimens. Stiffness-based stress-number of cycle (SN) curves were drawn for the two sets of specimens. The amount of stiffness loss for cross-ply and angle-ply specimens was observed to depend on the fatigue load level.

The present model is mainly composed of three parts: First, quadratic stress based failure criteria are presented to predict the onset of various damage modes. Second, the post-damage softening response is controlled by a linear form damage evolution law combined with the fracture energy approach. Stiffness progressive reduction is characterized by a variable determined by equivalent displacement for each failure mode and in doing so the mesh dependency can be reduced appreciably. Third, strain rate dependency of the strength and the modulus of FRP laminated materials are also considered. Comparisons are made between the present numerical results and some available test data.

Failure mechanisms in the annulus were investigated using composite lamination theory and other analyses to calculate stresses in annulus layers, interlaminar shear stress, and the region of stress concentration around a fiber break. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate failure patterns in the annulus and evaluate novel structural features of the disc tissue. Stress concentrations in the annulus due to an isolated fiber break were localized to approximately 5??m away from the break, and only considered a likely cause of annulus fibrosus failure (i.e., radial tears in the annulus) under extreme loading conditions or when collagen damage occurs over a relatively large region. Interlaminar shear stresses were calculated to be relatively large, to increase with layer thickness (as reported with degeneration), and were considered to be associated with propagation of circumferential tears in the annulus. SEM analysis of intervertebral disc annulus fibrosus tissue demonstrated a clear laminate structure, delamination, matrix cracking, and fiber failure.

The scratch damage severs several load bearing plies and results in a lack of symmetry in an originally symmetric multidirectional laminate. The ply-by-ply p-version finite element model is used to investigate the effects of the repair patch variables on the overall efficiency of the repair procedure and the lamina level stress states.

Three types of laminates were investigated: cross-ply, multi-directional and angle-ply. Following immersion for over four months, a steady state moisture uptake was reached for the ambient temperature specimens while no such state of saturation was observed for those immersed at 90°C temperature. Fatigue life curves of the immersed specimens are compared to those of the dry ones and the failure modes are discussed. Immersion in 90° temperature results in excessive swelling and cracking, and considerable reduction in the fatigue resistance. The inter-relation among accumulated creep strain due to cyclic loading, crack density variation and stiffness reduction are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "The objective of this work is the characterization and the assessment of the damage in CFRP composite laminates with different stacking sequences subjected to low velocity impact and flexural loading. Charpy impact test and three-point bending test were used in order to obtained the impact response and flexural behaviour of different laminates. An experimental test series was carried out to determine impact energy absorption, flexural strength and stiffness and failure mechanisms of composite laminates made from M21E/IMA, an unidirectional prepreg used in Airbus A350 XWB primary structures. It is important to note that both elastic moduli and strength in the principal material directions are different under tension and compression. The flexural modulus is expected to have an intermediate value between the tensile and compression moduli. We analyze the effect of this type of multimodulus materials [1–3] in order to evaluate the influence of the geometry of the specimen on the failure modes (shear or flexural failure modes) observed in the three-point bending test and compare the results with tensile and compression behaviour. Two main lay-up configurations have been analyzed: Unidirectional laminates [0]12,[90]12,[45]12 and multidirectional laminates (cross-ply [0/90]3s, angle-ply [±45]3s and quasi-isotropic laminates [0/90/±452]s). Unidirectional laminates are rarely used in structural components but help to assess the different types of damage (splitting, matrix cracking, delamination) and response of the specimens under low-velocity impact and flexural loading. They are usually combined with plies of varying orientation in multidirectional laminates. These laminates exhibit a more complex behaviour due to coupling effects and the combination of different failure modes. In this study, both impact and flexural response for the different laminates have been compared. Special attention is paid in the response of multidirectional laminates under flexural (and impact) loading. Shear effects are very important in this type of laminates. Only a limited number of experimental studies have been developed in this context [4–7] . Additionally, the failure modes observed under impact and flexural loading were correlated with fracture energy absorption and load-deflection behaviour respectively for the unidirectional and mulitidirectional laminates. The results have shown that the effect of the stacking sequences on the impact and flexural response depicted similar trends than in the case of tensile response studied in previous works [8–11]. Furthermore, the present work has shown a distinctive behaviour of ±453s angle-ply laminate.under impact loading due to its pseudo-ductile behaviour. This laminate exhibited the best impact performance in terms of averaged absorbed energy but the flexural strength and stiffness drastically decreased compared to [0]12 laminate. Finally, SEM and optical micrographs of fracture surfaces were used to gain an insight into the assessment of different type of damage of the previous laminates.",

Single cantilever beam (SCB) tests revealed that a good level of adhesion can be achieved by using a hot dip zinc surface treatment on the DP500 steel and incorporating an interlayer based on modified polypropylene at the interface between the composite and metal plies. In addition, SCB tests have shown that the interfacial fracture energy of the hybrid laminates increased with increasing crosshead displacement rate. Additional testing of a number of laminates has shown that the tensile properties of these composite-metal hybrid laminates are strongly dependant on the tensile properties of the constituent materials and that a modified rule of mixtures could be used to predict such properties. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new cohesive model to stably and accurately simulate the delamination propagations in composite laminates under quasi-static and low-velocity impact transverse loads using comparatively coarse meshes. In this model, a pre-softening zone ahead of the existing traditional softening zone is proposed. In this pre-softening zone, the initial stiffnesses and the interface strengths at the integration points of cohesive elements are gradually reduced as the corresponding effective relative displacements at these points increase. However, the onset displacement corresponding to the onset damage is not changed in this model. Moreover, the fracture toughness of materials for determining the final displacement of complete decohesion is kept constant. This cohesive model is implemented in the explicit time integration scheme combined with a powerful three-dimensional (3D) hybrid finite element for evaluating the delamination propagations on interfaces in composite laminates. A DCB problem is employed to analyze the characteristics of the present cohesive model. In order to reduce the computational cost for dealing with more complex problems, a stress-based criterion is also adopted in our numerical model for evaluating various in-plane damages, such as matrix cracks, fiber breakage, etc. Finally, two experimental examples are employed to illustrate the validity of the present approach. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For such laminates, successive passes of the fiber placement head often overlap resulting in thickness build-up. If a constant thickness is desired, tows will be cut at the course boundary, which can result in small triangular resin-rich areas without any fibers. In this article a theoretical, numerical investigation of the influence of these tow-drop areas on the strength and stiffness of variable-stiffness laminates is performed. The effects of tow width, laminate thickness and staggering in combination with tow-drop areas are studied by making use of finite element simulations. A method for the localization of tow-drop areas is presented, and the expressions for implementing the tow-drop areas in a finite element model are given. Subsequently, progressive failure analyses using the LaRC failure criteria are performed. Failure occurs at tow-drop locations in both the surface plies and underlying plies. Wider tows result in lower strength. No correlation seems to exist between thickness and laminate strength, while staggering has a positive influence on strength. © SAGE Publication 2009.",

Results indicate that the corner geometry at the end of the bonded area as well as the length of the overlap have a significant influence on the fatigue strength of the joints, while the layer orientation at the adhesive/adherend interface was seen to have a lesser influence on the fatigue performance. The evolution of fatigue damage, consisting in its essential features of crack initiation followed by propagation up to a critical length, is investigated by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy and by monitoring the stiffness of the tested joints. As a result, it is seen that a 45?? oriented layer at the adhesive-interface makes crack paths much more complicated with respect to 0?? oriented interface joints, with an increase in the crack propagation resistance. Moreover, measurements of the evolution of axial stiffness are promising in order to develop a simplified technique to assess the crack propagation during fatigue life. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Glutaraldehyde treated bovine pericardium (GLBP), preselected for uniform structure and collagen fiber orientation, was used as the representative heart valve biomaterial. Using specialized instrumentation, GLBP specimens were subjected to cyclic tensile loading to maximum stress levels of 500 +/- 50 kPa at a frequency of 22 Hz. Two sample groups were examined, one with the preferred collagen fiber direction parallel (PD) and perpendicular (XD) to the direction of applied strain. The primary findings indicated that GLBP fatigue response was highly sensitive to the direction of loading with respect to fiber orientation. Specifically, when loading perpendicular to the preferred collagen fiber orientation, fiber reorientation is the dominant mechanism. In contrast, when loaded parallel to the preferred fiber direction a reduction in both collagen fiber crimp and fiber reorientation occurred. Moreover, alterations in the degree and direction of mechanical anisotropy can be inducted by cyclic loading when specimens are loaded perpendicular to the preferred fiber direction. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) results indicate that molecular-level damage to collagen occurs in both groups after only 20 x 10(6) cycles. Taken as a whole, the results of this study suggest that initial collagen orientation plays a critical role in bioprosthetic heart valve biomaterial fatigue response.",

          "abstract": "Presently, due to the energy saving concerns, there is an increase demand for lightweight structures for transportation industry, electric power wind generators among others. In this context design and maintenance of these civil engineering structures has put a stress on durability issues. The time scale for aeronautical applications is different for the rest of civil engineering structural applications therefore the durability experience accumulated on aeronautics is of little use. Usually civil engineering structures must remain in service for 50 years or more. Therefore the needs for real long-term mechanical performance prediction become quite important. Presently, for instance, the standards for buried GRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites) pipes demand more than 10,000 h of creep tests in order to extrapolate data for two decades (in the time log scale) with a high level of confidence. The accelerated methodology proposed by Miyano et al. [Miyano Y, Nakada M, Sekine N. Accelerated testing for long-term durability of FRP laminates for marine use. J Composite Mater 2005;39:5-20] on Carbon and Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP and GFRP) laminates, rests on the fact that the time-superposition principle is the same for static, creep and fatigue strengths. Although not universally verified, it has been used successfully to predict fatigue lifetimes of many typical composites. In this context time-dependent failure criteria for viscoelastic materials is reviewed. Comparison between creep failure and static failure under constant stress/strain rate tests are analyzed. Cumulative damage laws, including the classical Linear Cumulative Damage law (LCD), are introduced to enlighten these comparisons. Finally some applications to lifetime prediction under variable amplitude fatigue loading are presented. The empirical LCD law performance is compared against the other physical based cumulative damage laws using fatigue loading sequences invented to expose the incoherencies of LCD lifetime predictions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Multi-axial multi-ply fabric (MMF) or non-crimp stitched carbon fabric (NCF) reinforced epoxy composites, produced by the resin transfer moulding process are described. The mechanical properties of the composites - tensile, in-plane shear and out-of-plane shear - are measured in a number of orientations relative to the stitching direction for different NCF based laminates: quadriaxial, biaxial ??45 and 0/90??, as well as unidirectional. As expected, the quadriaxial laminates show a quasi-isotropic behaviour while biaxial laminates show an an-isotropic behaviour. The mechanical properties of the biaxial ??45?? laminates are similar to the 0/90?? laminates in the corresponding directions. The in-plane shear properties of the materials are strongly dependent on the amount of reinforcement in the +45 and -45?? direction relative to the loading direction. Absence of a significant difference in stiffness between experimental results and classical laminate theory predictions reveals that stitching has minor effects on the stiffness of this material. Tensile tests on 0/90?? laminates were accompanied by acoustic emission registration. The results were correlated with X-ray and C-Scan damage observation. Early (at 0.3% applied strain for load in fibre direction) initiation of damage has been detected. Damage sites are correlated with the resin-rich zones created by the stitching. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This study investigates the damage behaviors of polymer-lined CFRP (carbon fiber-reinforced plastic) laminates under tensile loading at room and cryogenic temps.

Specimens consisting of polymer films and cross-ply laminates were prepd. by co-curing and subjected to tension load.

Such relations are of particular interest in fracture of laminates consisting of layers of different fiber orientations. In this study, an iterative method based on internal strain measurements and parametric numerical modeling is employed to identify a traction-separation relation in quasi-static mode I dominated delamination of a cross-ply carbon fiber epoxy laminate. The results demonstrate that crack propagation is accompanied by a large bridging zone which is smaller than the zone in a uniaxial composite specimen of the same materials and linear dimensions. While the initiation value of the energy release rate (ERR) is the same, the ERR at steady state propagation and the maximum stress in the bridging zone are respectively 1.7 and 3.1 times larger than the corresponding values of the unidirectional specimen. The obtained traction-separation relation is employed in a cohesive zone model to predict the loading response and crack growth. The adopted approach is a step towards a better understanding of delamination in cross-ply composites.",

The orientation angle for each layer can be selected as a discrete variable in the domain of -85° to 90°, at 5° intervals. Two case studies are analyzed. In the first one the predicted damage area is minimized whereas, in the second one, the absorbed elastic strain energy is maximized. The results show that this problem is a multi-optimum problem. By using this methodology on dispersed laminates, the predicted impact damage area can be reduced by more than 20% while the objective function of the second case can be improved by 8% compared to the traditionally designed configurations. These results evidence the possibility to improve the damage tolerance using dispersed laminates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

In this study, helical-ribbon carbon nanofibers (CNF) were dispersed in the matrix phase of a continuous carbon fiber-reinforced composite. Along with an unreinforced control, the resulting hierarchical composites were tested to failure in several modes of quasi-static testing designed to assess matrix-dominated mechanical properties and fracture characteristics. Results indicated CNF addition offered simultaneous increases in tensile stiffness, strength and toughness while also enhancing both compressive and flexural strengths. Short-beam strength testing resulted in no apparent improvement while the fracture energy required for the onset of mode I interlaminar delamination was enhanced by 35%. Extrinsic toughening mechanisms, e.g., intralaminar fiber bridging and trans-ply cracking, significantly affected steady-state crack propagation values.

          "abstract": "Carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites used in sports products can be exposed to different in-service conditions such as large dynamic bending deformations caused by impact loading. Composite materials subjected to such loads demonstrate various damage modes such as matrix cracking, delamination and, ultimately, fabric fracture. Damage evolution affects both in-service properties and performance of CFRP that can deteriorate with time. These failure modes need adequate means of analysis and investigation, the major approaches being experimental characterisation and numerical simulations. This research deals with a deformation behaviour and damage in composite laminates due to dynamic bending. Experimental tests are carried out to characterise the behaviour of a woven CFRP material under large-deflection dynamic bending in impact tests carried out to obtain the force-time and absorbed energy profiles for CFRP laminates. Damage in the impacted laminates is analysed using optical microscopy. Numerical simulations are performed to study the deformation behaviour and damage in CFRP for cases of large-deflection bending based on three-dimensional finite-element models implemented in the commercial code Abaqus/Explicit. Multiple layers of bilinear cohesive-zone elements are employed to model the initiation and progression of inter-ply delamination observed in the microscopy studies. The obtained results of simulations show good agreement with experimental data.",

          "abstract": "The use of externally bonded carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (EB-CFRP) to strengthen deficient reinforced concrete (RC) beams has gained in popularity and has become a viable and cost-effective method. Fatigue behavior of RC beams strengthened with FRP is a complex issue due to the multiple variables that affect it (applied load range, frequency, number of cycles). Very few research studies have been conducted in shear under cyclic loading. The use of prefabricated CFRP L-shaped laminates (plates) for strengthening RC beams under static loading has proven to be technically feasible and very efficient. This study aimed to examine the fatigue performance of RC T-beams strengthened in shear for increased service load using prefabricated CFRP L-shaped laminates. The investigation involved six laboratory tests performed on full-size 4520 mm-long T-beams. The specimens were subjected to fatigue loading up to six million load cycles at a rate of 3 Hz. Two categories of specimens (unstrengthened and strengthened) and three different transverse-steel reinforcement ratios (Series S0, S1, and S3) were considered. Test results were compared with the upper fatigue limits specified by codes and standards. The specimens that did not fail in fatigue were then subjected to static loading up to failure. The test results confirmed the feasibility of using CFRP L-shaped laminates to extend the service life of RC T-beams subjected to fatigue loading. The overall response was characterized by an accelerated rate of damage accumulation during the early cycles, followed by a stable phase in which the rate slowed significantly. In addition, the strains in the stirrups decreased after the specimens were strengthened with CFRP, despite the higher applied fatigue loading. Moreover, the addition of L-shaped laminates enhanced the shear capacity of the specimens and changed the failure mode from brittle to ductile under static loading. Finally, the presence of transverse steel in strengthened beams resulted in a substantially reduced gain in shear resistance due to CFRP, confirming the existence of an interaction between the transverse steel and the CFRP.",

The damage level corresponds to an initial stage of damage due to an indentation loading, which leads to a strength degradation of the composite. The hybrid composites consist of the CFRP prepreg and the NWCT prepreg, which are made by interleaving the NWCT prepreg into the CFRP layer interfaces. Four kinds of cross-ply laminates are studied; i.e., CFRP laminates ([05/905/05] and [03/903/03/903/03]) and hybrid laminates ([05//905//05] and [03//903//03//903//03]). Here, the symbol &quot;//&quot; means that the NWCT prepreg is located at an interface between CFRP layers. The hybrid effect is examined by investigating the delamination area and the absorption energy of two cross-ply laminates. As it has been recognized that the quasi-static indentation damage agrees well with the low-velocity impact test results, the present static test results can then be used to understand the damage mechanism of low-energy impact. The damaged parts of the specimens were observed by the deply technique and the cut method which used a microscope. The NWCT interleaving&#039;s effect was clarified based on the observation of the damage for the hybrid specimen&#039;s cross-sections after indentation testing. The delamination area of the hybrid composites was reduced to about a half of the CFRP&#039;s by indentation loading. It was clarified that the Mode II interlaminar fracture is predominant in the delamination by the impact.",

          "abstract": "Transverse and shear damage in the polymer matrix of fiber reinforced composites are often treated independently, while the associated cracks are similar in appearance and effect. Matrix damage is often quantified by its crack density. However, damage also can be presented as a state variable. The definition of damage state variables and their evolution laws are the foundation of continuum damage mechanics, yet experimental data for shear damage evolution is limited. The effect of crack closure on the transverse stiffness of laminates was already incorporated in the damage models. However, the shear modulus sensitivity to crack closure has received little attention due to the complicated constitutive equations. This paper focused on the in-plane shear modulus reduction due to matrix transverse cracks and the evolution of transverse and shear damage. The comparison of existing models with experimental data showed that shear damage is currently not suitably described. Accordingly, a shear damage evolution model was proposed that included the effect of internal traction and crack closure on the in-plane shear modulus. The numerical predictions of the modified shear model resulted in good agreement with experimental data by predicting the same saturation crack density, axial and shear responses.",

The shock testing was performed in a small-scale underwater explosion facility, and by using larger explosive charges and smaller separation distances between the charge and GRP, it was possible to exert higher underwater shock wave pressures on the laminate. The laminate was then fatigue tested in tension-compresion at a stress ratio, R, of - 1 to obtain S-N curves. At low shock pressures the laminate experienced a small amount of cracking in the polymer matrix, but this did not alter the fatigue performance compared with the unshocked laminate. At high shock pressures the laminate experienced gross structural damage in the form of polymer cracking, delamination between the polymer and glass fibre, and fracture of the glass fibres. These effects caused a large reduction in the fatigue resistance. ?? 1995 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Knowledge of the influence of the weave structure on the mechanical properties of the composite is essential to properly optimize the design of structural components. The focus of this work is to investigate the influence of the type of weave used for fabric reinforcement in polymers particularly on the in-plane shear mechanical performance. The selected materials are carbon fibers and epoxy resin. The laminates are manufactured by vacuum infusion. Three woven structures are selected for manufacturing the composite laminates: (a) a plain weave with unidirectional orientation in the warp direction, (b) a plain weave with balanced properties in the warp and weft directions and (c) a 2/2 twill weave with balanced properties in the warp and weft directions. The laminates are tested according to the ASTM D 4255 standard by a two-rail shear test under quasi-static monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. The resulting stress-strain curves are used to study the initial in-plane shear modulus and its evolution (which directly correlates with material damage) and the hardening produced by plastic strain. The results show that for vacuum infusion manufacturing, the weave structure has an influence on the resulting fiber and void volume fractions and, consequently, on the mechanical performance. However, for similar fiber volumes, the weave structure is found to have little effect on the experimental results.",

The mechanical properties of FML shows improvements over the properties of both aluminum alloys and composite materials individually. Due to their excellent properties, FML are being used as fuselage skin structures of the next generation commercial aircrafts. One of the advantages of FML when compared with conventional carbon fiber/epoxy composites is the low moisture absorption. The moisture absorption in FML composites is slower when compared with polymer composites, even under the relatively harsh conditions, due to the barrier of the aluminum outer layers. Due to this favorable atmosphere, recently big companies such as EMBRAER, Aerospatiale, Boing, Airbus, and so one, starting to work with this kind of materials as an alternative to save money and to guarantee the security of their aircrafts.",

          "abstract": "Recent experimental efforts have established the significance of the fibre-matrix interface /interphase in the long-term behaviour of polymeric composites. Results indicate that small alterations at the interface level could translate into orders-of-magnitude changes in fatigue life. However, there is no model currently available in the literature to predict these changes. In this paper, a micromechanics model that includes the effects of the fibre-matrix interface is used in a simple cumulative damage scheme to predict the tensile fatigue behaviour of composite laminates. A new parameter called the ‘efficiency of the interface’ is used to model the degradation of the in terface under fatigue loading. A rate equation that describes the changes in interfacial efficiency as a function of cycles is estimated using experimentally determined stiffness reduction data. The influence of this interfacial efficiency parameter on the tensile strength of unidirectional laminates is assessed using a micromechanics model. The effect of damage on the stiffness of the laminate is estimated by solving a boundary value problem associated with the particular damage mode (e.g. transverse matrix cracking). The fatigue life of the laminate is estimated by considering changes in stiffness due to creep and damage in the subcritical elements, and changes in strength associated with the critical element (0° ply). The influence of a fibre-matrix interface is included in the model by considering the degradation in the interface (interfacial efficiency) under fatigue loading. Changes in the interface property are used in the micromechanics model to estimate changes in the in-situ tensile strength of the 0° ply. The stress state and the strength of the 0° ply, calculated including the effects of damage, are then used in a maximum strain failure criterion to determine the fatigue life of the laminate. Predictions from this model are compared with experimental data. The predicted fatigue life and failure modes agree very well with the experimental data.",

          "abstract": "The stacking sequence design of composite laminates is often limited to combinations of 0??, 90??, and ??45?? fibre angle plies. Furthermore, in order to comply to certain stiffness requirements, clustering of plies becomes unavoidable. Although such laminates might have the desired stiffness properties, they may show poor impact and/or compression-after-impact behaviour. A method to redesign the traditional stacking sequences such that the alternative laminates have improved damage resistance whilst keeping similar in-plane and bending stiffness properties as their original traditional stacking sequences is proposed. This method makes use of optimisation tools based on genetic algorithms. In the alternative laminates, the difference between fibre angles of two consecutive plies is maximised and allowed to vary in the 0-90?? fibre angle range at intervals of 5??. Manufacturing of such laminates is practical nowadays as the industry is changing its production techniques into accurate automated fibre-placement and tape-laying technologies. A two-step approach is proposed for the design of laminates. In the first step, the optimal laminate is designed in the traditional fashion to cope with the expected quasi-static loads on the structure. The second step consists of redesigning this laminate to better withstand impact loads by dispersing its stacking sequence while keeping similar stiffness properties as in the first step. A traditional laminate and two dispersed stacking sequence alternative layups were tested under low-velocity impact and compression-after-impact loads in order to compare their impact resistance and damage tolerance characteristics. The evaluation of these laminates will also be carried out by the innovative numerical tools proposed in the follow-up of the present paper. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Compression failure of composite structures previously damaged by an impact event is due to the propagation of impact-induced damage mechanisms such as interlaminar debonding, constituent (i.e., matrix and fiber) microcracking, sublaminate buckling, as well as the interactions between these mechanisms. The failure mechanisms within each ply are idealized based on a reduced order multiscale computational model, in which, the damage propagation in the matrix and fibers upon compression is explicitly modeled. Delamination along the ply interfaces is idealized using a cohesive surface model. The initial impact-induced damage within the microconstituents and interfaces are inferred from experimental observations. A suite of numerical simulations is conducted to understand the sublaminate buckling, propagation of delamination and constituent damage upon compression loading. The numerical investigations suggest extensive propagation of delamination with mode transition preceding sublaminate buckling. Initiation and propagation of matrix and fiber cracking, observed upon sublaminate buckling, is the cause of ultimate shear failure. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "High performance composite materials, such as Carbon–Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) composites, are being increasingly used in aerospace industry, such as fuselage primary structures in Boeing 787 or Airbus 350, where high strength and stiffness are required at minimum weight [1]. The design of composite structures frequently includes discontinuities such as cut-outs for access and fastener holes for joining and they become critical regions under thermo-mechanical loading. Understanding of notched specimen behaviour is necessary for the design of complex structures where parts are mostly connected with bolts and rivets [2]. The effect of these discontinuities on the behaviour of composite materials is an important topic because it causes a relatively large reduction in strength compared to the unnotched laminate [3]. In the first part of the current work, the assessment of the damage process taking place in notched (open-hole) specimens under uniaxial tensile loading was studied. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques were employed to obtain full-field surface strain measurements in carbon–fibre/epoxy M21/T700 composite plates with different stacking sequences in the presence of an open circular hole. Penetrant enhanced X-ray radiographs were taken to identify damage location and extent after loading around the hole. DIC strain fields were compared to numerical predictions. In the second part of the study, DIC techniques were used to characterise damage and performance of adhesively bonded patch repairs in composite panels under tensile loading. This part of work relates to strength/stiffness restoration of damaged composite aircraft that becomes more important as composites are used more extensively in the construction of modern jet airliners. In the current work, external bonded patches have been studied. Adhesively bonded repairs are the most common type of repair carried out with composite materials [1,4]. The behaviour of bonded patches under loading was monitored using DIC full-field strain measurements. Location and extent of damage identified by X-ray radiography correlates well with DIC strain results giving confidence to the technique for structural health monitoring of bonded patches.",

Failure envelopes are generated for combined loading of these laminates on the basis of first-ply failure and laminate fracture. The chapter also presents a micromechanics-based theory and progressive fracture for the evaluation of failure envelopes. It explains an exercise organized by Hinton and Soden to confirm the current state-of-the-art for predicting failure in composites and describes the results obtained in two processes-generation of first-ply failure envelopes for combined loading by using the micromechanics-based uniaxial composite strengths and generation of laminate fracture envelopes and stress/strain diagrams for uniaxial and combined loading by using progressive fracture. The effects of residual stresses on the laminate first-ply failure are also evaluated as the differences between pristine and in situ constituent properties. The chapter explains the detailed calibration of the pristine constituent material properties to the unidirectional composite properties, so that the micromechanics used will reproduce the unidirectional composite properties provided. It discusses the specific theories and computer codes to generate the laminate failure envelopes. These computer codes integrate composite mechanics and progressive structural fracture-Integrated Composite Analyzer (ICAN) and Composite Durability Structural Analyzer (CODSTRAN). The chapter describes stress versus strain curves for all laminates as determined by progressive fracture via CODSTRAN.",

Part I of this work modeled the growth of the coupled damage mode. Fatigue experiments were conducted on single edge notch tension specimens to measure the crack growth rate. This paper compares the model predictions with experimental data. The three-dimensional finite element model successfully captured the damage growth behavior for two of the lay-ups ([Ti/0/90/02]s and [Ti/90/0/902]s) in the experimental program. However, in a third lay-up, [Ti/0/90/??30]s, the underlying damage modes were found to be sufficiently different than the other two lay-ups and the model did not capture the steady-state growth behavior. The effects of temperature and specimen size were also investigated for TiGr laminates. Except for the effects of the load ratio, elevated temperatures did not affect the crack growth rate significantly. For wider specimens, the steady-state fatigue crack growth behavior was similar to the narrow specimens, indicating that the steady-state facesheet crack growth behavior is independent of specimen size. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "A theory is developed and experiments designed to study the concept of using shape memory alloy (SMA) wires to effect the snap-through of unsymmetric composite laminates. The concept is presented in the context of structural morphing, that is, a structure changing shape to adjust to changing conditions or to change operating characteristics. While the specific problem studied is a simplification, the overall concept is to potentially take advantage of structures which have multiple equilibrium configurations and expend power only to change the structure from one configuration to another rather than to continuously expend power to hold the structure in the changed configuration. The unsymmetric laminate could be the structure itself, or simply part of a structure. Specifically, a theory is presented which allows for the prediction of the moment levels needed to effect the snap-through event. The moment is generated by a force and support arrangement attached to the laminate. A heated SMA wire attached to the supports provides the force. The necessary SMA constitutive behavior and laminate mechanics are presented. To avoid dealing with the heat transfer aspects of the SMA wire, the theory is used to predict snap-through as a function of SMA wire temperature, which can be measured directly. The geometry and force level considerations of the experiment are discussed, and the results of testing four unsymmetric laminates are compared with predictions. Laminate strain levels vs. temperature and the snap-through temperatures are measured for the these laminates. Repeatability of the experimental results is generally good, and the predictions are in reasonable agreement with the measurements. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A classical interface damage evolution law, which is commonly used to predict the static debonding process, is modified further to incorporate fatigue delamination effects due to high cycle loadings. An improved formulation is also presented to incorporate the &#039;R&#039; ratio effects. The proposed fatigue damage model is identified using fracture mechanics tests like double cantilever beam, end-notched-flexure and mixed-mode bending. Then a non-monotonic behavior is used to predict the fatigue damage parameters able to carry out delamination simulations for different mode mixtures.

Model specimens including LDPE resin, [+/- 90 degrees] laminate, single fiber composite, fiber bundle composite, and [+/- 45 degrees] laminates are fabricated to obtain expected damage mechanisms during tensile testing. First, mechanical behaviors and corresponding AE response of model specimens are studied to validate damage mechanisms in UHMWPE/LDPE laminates. Second, relationship among AE descriptors is investigated by hierarchical cluster analysis, and AE signals are classified by k-means cluster analysis. Correlations between damage mechanisms and AE are established in terms of amplitude, duration, and peak frequency of AE signals. Finally, an artificial neural network is created and trained by various optimal algorithms to identify damage mechanisms. The results reveal that typical damage mechanisms in PE self-reinforced composite can be classified in terms of the similarity between AE signals and identified by trained artificial neural network.

          "abstract": "Fatigue- and fracture-related cracks are to be expected with the large number of fasteners present in aircraft structures. Therefore, contact stresses around the fastener holes and stress intensity factors associated with edge cracks are critical concerns in damage-tolerant designs. Mechanical joints consisting of many fasteners with a staggered pattern further complicate the already rather complex analysis for single-fastener joints. Load distribution among the fasteners significantly influences the failure load of multi-fastener joints. Most existing analyses are confined to single-fastener joints, and the data available for multi-fastener joints are rather limited. Very few experimental and/or analytical/numerical investigations of contact stresses for mechanical joints with staggered fasteners exist in the literature. Therefore, the accurate prediction of contact stresses (load distribution) and stress intensity factors associated with edge cracks is essential for the reliable design of such mechanical joints. This study concerns the development of an analytical methodology, based on the boundary collocation technique, to determine the contact stresses and stress intensity factors required for strength and life prediction of bolted joints with many fasteners. It provides an analytical capability for determining the contact stresses in mechanically fastened composite laminates while capturing the effects of finite geometry, presence of edge cracks, interaction among fasteners, material anisotropy, fastener flexibility, fastener-hole clearance, friction between the pin and the laminate, and by-pass loading. Also, it permits determination of the fastener load distribution, which significantly influences the failure load of a multi-fastener joint.",

Damage free holes can be made using modified drill geometry. The present research investigation focuses on the drill geometry as candidate parameter that influence drilling forces and drilling-induced damage. The four different drill geometries (solid and hollow in shape) are used for drilling in composite materials. The cutting mechanism of these drill geometries is substantially different, and therefore influences the drilling-induced damage. The experimental results suggest a strong relationship between the drill point geometry and the drilling-induced damage.",

          "abstract": "Large scale bridging is an important toughening mechanism in composite laminates that depends on the specimen geometry as well as the constituent materials. In this work, an iterative approach is applied to identify the effect of specimen thickness on traction-separation behavior in the bridging zone. Double cantilever beam specimens (DCB) with embedded arrays of wavelength-multiplexed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are subjected to monotonic mode I fracture loading. As processed specimens with thicknesses h = 2, 4, 8 and 10 mm as well as specimens of h = 4 mm milled down from the 8 and 10 mm are tested. Non-homogeneous strain distributions in the vicinity of the interlaminar crack plane are locally monitored by means of embedded FBGs. The measured strain data are used to quantify the bridging tractions associated with each specimen thickness and consequently the energy release rate (ERR) due to the bridging. The results show that the bridging zone length and the ERR at the plateau level increase with specimen thickness while the results for all specimens with h = 4 are the same thus excluding any processing effects. Moreover, the maximum stress of traction-opening in the bridging zone and crack opening displacement at the end of the zone are independent of thickness. In contrast, the rate of tractions decay depends on the specimen thickness in that it decreases with thickness scaling. Thus the so-called bridging law is not a material parameter. The identified traction-separation relations are employed in a cohesive zone model to predict fracture of DCB specimens with different thicknesses.",

In ZnO/woven carbon fiber composite laminates, the interlaminar region, composed of ZnO nanostructured arrays embedded on woven carbon fiber sheets, interacts with the thermoset vinyl ester resin. ZnO nanostructured arrays were formed into nanorods (NRs) using a hydrothermal process. To investigate the electrical resistive heating behavior of the interlaminar region, we analyzed the temperature profile as a function of time in three zones: a heating zone, a maximum temperature zone, and a cooling zone. The morphology of the ZnO NRs was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis was used to characterize the crystallinity and ZnO concentration. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to analyze the specific heat capacity of ZnO/woven carbon fiber composite laminates. Electrical resistive heating was achieved in the interlaminar region through multiple junctions formed between the intrinsic woven carbon fiber tows and among the ZnO NRs. The contribution of the ZnO NRs to the thermal heat gain was interconnected with the woven carbon fiber and resin in the interlaminar regions. The interlaminar resistance between the upper and lower laminas of ZnO/woven carbon fiber composites increased with incremental increases in the ZnO concentration up to 110. mM. This effect was due to the interlaminar interface and the high surface density of ZnO NRs, which inhibit electron transport into the woven carbon fibers. Resistance decreased following electrical resistive heating due to an increase in the density of free electrons at high temperatures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Six full-scale single-story single-bay steel frames with different infill configurations were tested. The retrofitting technique using GFRP laminates aimed at creating an engineered infill wall with a well defined failure mode and a stable postpeak behavior as well as containing the hazardous URM damage and preventing catastrophic failure. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the GFRP laminates in preventing both shear and tension cracking by supplying the required tensile and shear strength. The GFRP laminates also increased the lateral load capacity and enhanced the postpeak behavior by stabilizing the masonry face shells and preventing their out-of-plane spalling. Supporting the face shells against out-of-plane spalling, allowed the wall to carry more in-plane loads and prevented sudden drop in the load carrying capacity.",

At lower stress levels, the majority of damage was produced in the first few cycles and then the rate of damage accumulation gradually approached a steady value as the cycles proceeded. When the applied stress exceeded the endurance fatigue limit, extensive damage took place and led to failure of the composite. Changes of composite electrical resistance, AE activity and surface temperature had fairly well agreement with the modulus and hysteresis responses.

The validity of these in situ analyses was confirmed by X-ray micro-computed tomography (??CT) observations on tensile loaded specimens. Experimental results demonstrated that relative humidity (RH) conditions influence strongly the damage level and damage mechanisms. Indeed, for specimen with RH = 0%, damage initiation occurs at significantly higher load level than those in RH = 50% and RH = 100% specimens. The higher relative humidity condition also results in higher damage level. Damage chronologies have been proposed as damage initiation in the form of fiber-matrix debonding occurs at fiber ends and more generally at locations where fibers are close to each other due to the generation of local stress concentration (for all studied RH contents), and first fiber breakages occur (RH = 0%). These debonded zones further propagate through fiber-matrix interface (for all studied RH contents), and new fiber breakages develop (RH = 0%). At high relative flexural stress, matrix microcracks appear and grow regardless the RH contents. For RH = 100%, these microcracks are also accompanied by many matrix deformation bands. Subsequently, they lead to the damage accumulation and then to the final failure. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we developed a finite element fluid-structure interaction model to understand the deformation and failure mechanisms of both monolithic and sandwich composite panels. A new failure criterion that includes strain-rate effects was formulated and implemented to simulate different damage modes in unidirectional glass fiber/matrix composites. The laminate model uses Hashin&#039;s fiber failure criterion and a modified Tsai-Wu matrix failure criterion. The composite moduli are degraded using five damage variables, which are updated in the post-failure regime by means of a linear softening law governed by an energy release criterion. A key feature in the formulation is the distinction between fiber rupture and pull-out by introducing a modified fracture toughness, which varies from a fiber tensile toughness to a matrix tensile toughness as a function of the ratio of longitudinal normal stress to effective shear stress. The delamination between laminas is modeled by a strain-rate sensitive cohesive law. In the case of sandwich panels, core compaction is modeled by a crushable foam plasticity model with volumetric hardening and strain-rate sensitivity. These constitutive descriptions were used to predict deformation histories, fiber/matrix damage patterns, and inter-lamina delamination, for both monolithic and sandwich composite panels subjected to underwater blast. The numerical predictions were compared with experimental observations. We demonstrate that the new rate dependent composite damage model captures the spatial distribution and magnitude of damage significantly more accurately than previously developed models. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

It is derived that in the static loading, the critical damage that yields shear matrix crack is kink and the critical condition to the final failure is the appearance of kink in every inner 0?? layer and that in the fatigue loading within the moderate load, the critical damage that yields shear matrix crack is almost always kink-like damage along the collapse front and at high load it is rather kink. Next, the non-elastic elongation of a joint at the maximum load subtracted by the one at 10th cycle is focused on and its capability is figured out for various stacking sequences. The critical value UNE, F* for the elongation rate change to the final fatigue failure is around 50-65 ??m in the present material. The critical condition to the final fatigue failure and corresponding to UNE, F* is roughly the appearance of mostly kink-like damage in every inner 0?? layer. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Of the four composites investigated here, a SRPP composite offered superior properties to basalt-, flax-, and hemp fiber-reinforced PP composites. Adding aluminum layers to the outer surfaces of the composites resulted in a significant enhancement in the tensile and impact properties of the laminates. The tensile strength and modulus properties of the FMLs obey a rule of mixtures approach, suggesting that simple procedures can be used to design these hybrid systems. Under low-velocity impact loading, the SRPP, and its associated FML, offered the highest resistance to perforation, as a result of gross plastic deformation in the composite and metal plies. A semi-empirical model, previously employed to characterize metal plates, was used to characterize the low-velocity impact response of the laminates investigated here. The model was capable of predicting the trends in the experimental data with reasonable success. This evidence suggests that environmental-friendly fiber-based FMLs offer significant potential for use in engineering applications. The Author(s) 2011.",

          "abstract": "Compressive mechanical behaviour and failure modes of E (electrical)-glass/polyester composite laminates tailored with a thermoplastic preforming polyester binder were investigated under ply-lay up and in-plane loading directions. Fiber preforms with various amount of the binder were consolidated under heat and pressure. The preform compaction experiments were performed by applying compressive pressure to the preforms, and the average thickness as a function of pressure was measured. It was found that the highest compaction of the preforms and therefore the highest fiber volume fraction can be obtained with 3 wt.% of the binder. Further increase of the amount of binder decreases the degree of compaction. Composite panels were fabricated by vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding using fabric preforms with various binder concentrations. The present investigation reveals that there are considerable effects of the binder on the compressive mechanical behaviour of the composites. Compression testing of the composites showed that the average strength values are in the range of 400-600 and 150-300 MPa for ply-lay up and in-plane directions, respectively. Also, both the strength and modulus values increase up to 3 wt.% of the binder, and these values decrease with further addition of the binder. Scanning electron microscopy showed that failure modes of the composites are altered significantly by the presence of the binder. Furthermore, the interaction between the binder and the reacting resin was followed to determine the extent of the binder dissolution and its effects on the viscosity of the resin and the mechanical behaviour of the matrix polymer. The results indicate that there is a partial dissolution of the binder within the matrix resin. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this study, the roles of these two mechanisms on the damage development in FRPs with in-plane random glass fiber reinforcement have been investigated. Two polymers are used as the matrix - isophthalic polyester and polyurethane. Polyurethane-based FRP shows higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and strain to failure, but lower elastic modulus. Under zero-tension fatigue loading (with the maximum stress level equivalent to 50% of their respective UTS), the change in modulus, energy dissipation rate, and the corresponding damage development process are investigated. The damage development is analyzed at the macroscopic and microscopic levels, and found to be closely related to the modulus degradation and change in energy dissipation rate. The study concludes that the two FRPs show significantly different behavior under fatigue loading. The polyurethane-based FRP had better fatigue resistance, in view of the mild modulus change and the capability of absorbing energy through plastic deformation. Results from the study suggest that the excellent fatigue resistance of the polyurethane-based FRP is due to good toughness of the matrix. © 2006 SAGE Publications.",

Tension-tension fatigue tests with a single change in stress amplitude are performed at room temperature for step-down and step-up sequences, respectively. History-dependence of the fatigue strength of GLARE 2 under two-stress level cycling conditions is examined through comparisons with the results of constant amplitude fatigue tests. The two-stress level fatigue strength is affected in a complicated manner by the sequence of fatigue load, the number of prior cycles and the off-axis angle of specimen. The subsequent fatigue life for the step-down sequence is governed by the decrease in stress amplitude, while for the step-up sequence it is done by both an increase in stress amplitude and the number of prior cycles. A characteristic nonlinear accumulation of the fatigue damage in GLARE 2 under two-stress level conditions is also highlighted by a comparison between the off-axis residual lives observed by experiments and those predicted using conventional linear and nonlinear fatigue damage accumulation theories. Finally, mechanisms of the two-stress level off-axis fatigue life of GLARE 2 are qualitatively discussed on the basis of the state of ply stress predicted using a modified classical laminated plate theory. It is suggested that the load-history dependence of the off-axis fatigue strength of GLARE 2 is due to the plastic deformation of the aluminum-alloy layers and to the variable-amplitude fatigue properties of the constituents. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model accounts for the irreversible strains caused by plasticity effects and material properties degradation due to the damage initiation and development. The strain-driven implicit integration procedure is developed using equa- tions of continuum damage mechanics, plasticity theory and includes the return mapping algorithm. A tangent operator consistent with the integration procedure is derived to ensure a computational effi- ciency of the Newton–Raphson method in the finite element analysis. The algorithm is implemented in Abaqus as a user-defined subroutine. The efficiency of the constitutive model and computational pro- cedure is demonstrated using the analysis of the progressive failure of composite laminates containing through holes and subjected to in-plane uniaxial tensile loading. It has been shown that the predicted results agree well with the experimental data reported in the literature.",

Tension and compression Split Hopkinson Bars coupled with a high-speed infrared detector array were used to measure in real time the variation of stress, strain and temperature in a fiber composite under a range of strain rates. Significant temperature rise was observed in both compression and tension tests. Combined results from temperature measurements and stress-strain curves indicate that this temperature rise is mainly due to damage of the material. The rate of temperature rise in all cases was seen to be almost linearly proportional to applied loading rate. Substantial differences were seen between the temperature generation during the compression and the tension experiments. The difference in the thermomechanical response was explained by different mechanisms being active in the compression and tension loading cases. The dependence of these results on strain rate indicates that there exists the concept of `damage rate sensitivity&#039;, which might be useful when establishing damage models that account for the energy absorbed during impact of fiber reinforced composite materials.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental research on the durability performance of compression molded sisal fiber-cement mortar laminates (SFRML). To obtain a material with enhanced performance, the used methodology was to replace the Portland cement (PC) by calcined clay (metakaolin and calcined waste crushed clay brick) in order to produce a matrix totally free of calcium hydroxide (CH). The content of calcium hydroxide in the matrix was determined by thermal analysis. SFRML were then produced using both a PC and a CH-free PC-calcined clay matrix and the composites were submitted to accelerated aging through cycles of wetting and drying. The durability of the SFRML was investigated by determining the effects of accelerated aging on the microstructures and flexural behavior of the composites. The results indicate that the newly developed CH-free matrix avoided the fiber embrittlement process keeping the toughness in time even after 100 cycles of wetting and drying. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper a new micromechanical approach is developed to overcome such shortcomings. For this purpose, a unit cell in the ply level of composite laminate including transverse cracking and delamination is considered. Then, the governing equations for the stress and displacement fields of the unit cell are derived. The obtained approximate stress field is used to calculate the energy release rate for the propagation of transverse cracking and induced delamination. To show the capability of the new method, it is employed for the analyses of general laminates with [0/90]. s, [45/-45]. s, [30/-30]. s and [90/45/0/-45]. s lay-ups under combined loadings to calculate the energy release rate due to the transverse cracking and induced delamination. It is shown that the obtained energy release rates for transverse cracking and delamination initiation are in good agreement with the available results in the literature and finite element method. Furthermore, the occurrence priority of further transverse cracks and/or delamination at each damage state of the laminates will be discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

During most of their life fatigue specimens had accumulated minimal damage which consisted of matrix cracks, transverse bundle cracks and intra-ply delamination. Just before failure fiber bundles began to straighten out and rotate towards the loading direction. This behavior led to large elongation and necking of the specimens before fracture. Overall, the matrix-dominated material behavior and fiber reorientation due to the off-axis configuration had a far greater influence on the fracture morphology than the gradual accumulation of damage due to fatigue loading. It was also found that damage formation was strongly influenced by the type of applied loading and the test temperature. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The matrix epoxy with a thickness of 50 ??m was chosen as the interleaf material in order to clarify the effect of resin-rich layer thickness on the delamination fatigue crack growth behavior. Tests under mode I loading were carried out using double cantilever beam specimens. For tests under mode II loading, three-point end notched flexure specimens were used for interlaminar fracture toughness tests, while four-point end notched flexure specimens were used for delamination fatigue tests. The mode I properties (interlaminar fracture toughness and delamination fatigue threshold) of these epoxy-interleaved CFRP laminates were almost identical to those of the laminates without interleaf (base CFRP laminates). The effect of epoxy interleaf was completely different under mode II loading. The mode II interlaminar fracture toughness for the epoxy-interleaved laminates was 1.6 (initial value) and 3.4 (propagation value) times higher than that for the base CFRP laminates. The mode II delamination fatigue threshold of the epoxy-interleaved laminates was 2-2.3 times higher than those of the base CFRP laminates. While the toughness of the interleaf is the key factor under mode I, the thickness of interlayer is the key factor under mode II. The difference in the effect of the self-same epoxy interlayer on the interlaminar fracture properties under modes I and II loadings was discussed on the bases of the fractographic observations and mechanism considerations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first part of this study, the results from a series of SHPB tests on the woven composites are presented in this paper. The compressive material properties are determined by testing the [0??/90??]&lt;inf&gt;26&lt;/inf&gt; laminate systems from low to high strain rates. Samples of cubic geometry are tested in in-plane and out-of-plane direction. Preliminary compressive stress-strain vs. strain rates data obtained show that the dynamic material strength increases with increasing strain rates. The tests show a strong material sensitivity to dynamic loading. For in-plane tests, there is a transitional strain rate, reflecting the dependencies on strain rate observed in experiments. The results indicate that the stress-strain curves, maximum compressive stresses and strains evolve as strain rate changes. During the experiments, a high speed camera was used to determine the kinetics of damage. The specimens are mainly damaged in a crushing and shear failure mode under out-of-plane loading, as for in-plane test, the failure was dominated by fiber buckling and delamination. In the second part of this study, numerical models without damage are developed to investigate the validity of assumptions of compression Split-Hopkinson Pressure Bar technique. Abaqus software was used for the numerical simulation. The results obtained by numerical investigation of SHPB are compared with the in-plane and out-of-plane compression test of a woven composite. A good correlation was noted between the experimental and numerical results, which allows validate the numerical approach.",

It was observed that edge delamination initiated and grew at parts where transverse cracks were dense at ordinary applied stress, whereas it was observed that edge delamination grew before or simultaneously with transverse crack propagation at a low applied stress and high-cycle loading.

Using the proposed method, the elastic-viscoplastic analysis of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates with various laminate configurations is performed to investigate their Poisson&#039;s ratios in the viscoplastic region. It is revealed that, for a range of laminate configurations, the through-the-thickness Poisson&#039;s ratios exhibit negative values which become increasingly negative as the viscoplastic deformation progresses in the laminates.

          "abstract": "The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the residual strength of GFRP laminates following a low-velocity impact event under cyclic loading. The residual strength is calculated using a linear fatigue damage model. According to an investigation into the effect of low-velocity impact on the fatigue behavior of laminates, it seems laminate fatigue life decreases after impact. By normalizing the fatigue stress against undamaged static strength, the Fatigue Damage parameter &quot;FD&quot; is presented with a linear relationship as its slope which is a linear function of the initial impact energy; meanwhile, the constants were attained from experimental data. FD is implemented into a plane-stress continuum damage mechanics based model for GFRP composite laminates, in order to predict damage threshold in composite structures. An S-N curve is implemented to indicate the fatigue behavior for 2 mm thickness encompassing both undamaged and impacted samples. A decline in lifespan is evident when the impact energy level increases. Finally, the FD is intended to capture the unique GFRP composite characteristics. ?? 2014 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Results are presented for laminates of unidirectional boron/epoxy symmetrically bonded to sheets of aluminum and titanium.

The fracture process in the laminates propagates mainly in the form of cracks in aluminum layers, delaminations between the resin-rich and fiber-rich prepreg layers, splitting in prepreg layers and fiber fracture. Ultrasonic microscopy has been used to evaluate the shape and size of the damage zone. The ultrasonic images have been calibrated by means of SEM and optical microscopy of the laminates with sequential removal of the layers. Microscopic examination reveals a direct correlation between delamination, fiber fracture, and fatigue crack growth in the aluminum layer. The results of this investigation strongly suggest that the laminate resistance to tension-tension biaxial fatigue Is superior to that under uniaxial loading conditions.",

The mesh configuration is dictated by the boundaries of a specimen, such as the presence of a hole, whereas the matrix cracking surfaces are aligned with the fiber direction in a given ply. The surface of the displacement jump associated with matrix cracking was defined in terms of the domain Heaviside function approximated by using higher-order polynomial B-splines. Several matrix cracks in each ply of a [0/45/90/–45]s composite were modeled, and their effect on the fiber-direction stress magnitude in the 0? ply was examined. Up to 35% relaxation of the fiber-direction strain amplitude due to matrix cracking (splitting) in the 0? ply was predicted. The moiré interferometry was used to experimentally determine the strain and displacement fields in the surface layer of the same composite, previously prestressed beyond the damage initiation load. A good correlation between the experimental data and the stress redistribution predicted by the mesh-independent damage modeling technique was observed.",

Based on an effective elastoplastic constitutive damage model for aligned fiber-reinforced composites, micromechanical damage constitutive models for two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) random fiber-reinforced composites are developed. The constitutive relations and overall yield function for aligned fiber orientations are averaged over all orientations to obtain the constitutive relations and overall yield function of 2D and 3D, random fiber-reinforced composites. Finally, the present damage models are implemented numerically and compared with experimental data to show the progressive damage behavior of random fiber-reinforced composites.

A testing protocol based on compression after impact reveals significant recovery of residual compressive strength (RCS) in self-healing panels. Self-healing panels show a higher threshold impact energy before RCS reduction, and as impact energy increases, RCS recovery decreases. Qualitative inspection shows that crack separation increases with increasing impact energy, indicating that self-healing performance depends on the ability to adequately fill damage volume. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

The main goal of the experimental investigation is to characterise the effect of the countersink geometry on the load-carrying capacity of single lap joints in comparison to the straight-shank case. The effects of bolt torque, clearance and countersink height ratio on the damage progression and joint strength are also studied. Experimental tests and detailed microscopy studies are conducted on a bearing test specimen with a straight-edged hole, and several single-lap joint configurations with countersunk fasteners. It is found that introduction of the countersunk hole roughly halves the bearing stress, and causes delamination for some configurations. This delamination is primarily located at the start of the countersink region, though is found to be triggered by other damage mechanisms and has only minor influence on the results. Bolt torque increases the density of through-thickness damage though limits its extension from the hole edge, whilst bolt clearance causes localisation of the damage region. Increasing the ratio of the countersink depth to the laminate thickness reduces the extent of bearing and promotes bending, with a change to net section failure at large ratios. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The proposed model is implemented into the Finite Element (FE) code ABAQUS/Explicit for one-integration point solid elements and validated against low velocity impact experimental results.Mesh-regularisation of the impact results is one of the greatest challenges in impact damage modelling of composite targets. Currently published mesh-regularisation strategies can produce mesh-size-independent impact results for a very limited range of mesh-sizes. The originality of the model presented in this paper is based on a novel mesh-regularisation strategy, which is applicable to predicting mesh-size-independent impact results for any target discretisation. Accurate modelling of composites&#039; impact damage using a relatively coarse mesh, and thus at a much reduced computational cost when compared to existing techniques, can be achieved with the proposed method. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

E-Glass/SC-79 epoxy composite laminates with four different fiber sizing formulations with various degrees of chemical bonding and surface texture have been investigated.

The punch shear strength and the total energy absorption per unit volume of composite with hybrid sizing have increased by 48% and 100% over the incompatible sizing.

As part of its development, the model is being verified to other models and validated with experimental data. The model has been validated to tensile experimental data with much success. For further validation of the model and its assumptions, an experimental program was conducted to investigate the compressive properties of stitched laminates for three different thicknesses. It was found that the unstitched modulus remained independent of thickness, while the stitched modulus increased with thickness due to spreading and kinking of the outer surface plies during the stitch formation process. The model predicted the change in modulus well, however did not capture the thickness effect observed in the experimental results. While it was found that stitching did have an influence on the in-plane compressive properties of the test specimens, the known damage tolerance and manufacturing advantages of stitched laminates are considered to outweigh any penalties for certain critical applications. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The method uses the peak force during impact obtained from energy balance, a Hertzian contact formulation and energy minimization to determine the complete state of stress in the laminate. Comparisons of the analytical predictions to limiting cases of infinite thickness plates or to detailed finite element models for finite thickness plates shows the predicted stresses to be in excellent agreement with other methods. The stresses are then modified to account for the creation of damage and used in out-of-plane and in-plane failure criteria to predict delamination sizes, matrix failure and fiber failure. The predicted damage states are then compared to published test results for two different materials, eight different stacking sequences, and a range of impact energies from 5 to 50 J. Very good agreement of the predicted damage sizes with the experimentally measured values is observed for a wide range of energy levels but, for two laminates, the discrepancies are significant. Possible improvements of the method are discussed briefly. This method is very promising and can be used in preliminary design allowing extensive trade studies and, eventually, layup optimization. It can also form the beginning of an efficient methodology to predict compression after impact strength of quasi-isotropic laminates. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The effect of strain rate on the compressive and shear behavior of carbon/epoxy composite materials was investigated. Strain rate behavior of composites with fiber waviness was also studied. Falling weight impact system and servohydraulic testing machine were used for dynamic characterisation of composite materials in compression at strain rates up to several hundred per second. Strain rates below 10 s-1 were generated using a hydraulic testing machine. Strain rates above 10 s-1 were generated using the drop tower apparatus developed. Seventy-two-ply unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminates (IM6G/3501-6) loaded in the longitudinal and transverse directions and (08/908)2/08s crossply laminates were characterised. Off-axis (30 and 45) compression tests of the same unidirectional material were also conducted to obtain the in-plane shear stress-strain behavior. The 90 properties, which are governed by the matrix, show an increase in modulus and strength over the static values but no significant change in ultimate strain. The shear stress-strain behavior, which is also matrix-dominated, shows high nonlinearity with a plateau region at a stress level that increases significantly with increasing strain rate. The 0 and crossply laminates show higher strength and strain values as the strain rate increases, whereas the modulus increases only slightly over the static value. The increase in strength and ultimate strain observed may be related to the shear behavior of the composite and the change in failure modes. In all cases the dynamic stress-strain curves stiffen as the strain rate increases. The stiffening is lowest in the longitudinal case and highest in the transverse and shear cases. Unidirectional and crossply specimens with fiber waviness were fabricated and tested. It is shown that, with severe fiber waviness, strong nonlinearity occurs in the stress-strain curves due to fiber waviness with significant stiffening as the strain rate increases. 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

For double-lap joints with finger-tight washers, specimens that fail in the bearing, tension and shear-out modes are investigated. For fully failed specimens and for specimens loaded to several percentages of failure load. the damage mechanisms are investigated using X-radiography and sectioning. It is concluded that failure occurs by a process of damage accumulation, where the failure mechanisms present are fiber fracture, delamination at the laminate loaded hole, matrix cracks and related fiber microbuckling, and internal delamination. Modelling this interaction between failure mechanisms requires further analytical efforts. Due to the importance of the through-thickness stresses present at the hole boundary, delamination has a significant effect on the joint strength, so the use of a three-dimensional failure criterion is suggested.",

Fibre-reinforced composites, foam core sandwich panels and fibre-metal laminates (FMLs) are examples of composite materials that are employed in high-performance engineering applications, for example in yachts, passenger aircraft, racing cars and sports equipment. Explosive loading is a potential threat to many of these structures, and therefore an improved understanding of the response of such systems to air-blast loading is important. This paper reviews recent experimental and numerical work on the response of composite materials, sandwich structures and hybrid materials to air-blast loading. Commonly employed experimental techniques used to simulate air-blast loading conditions are described, along with the results from recent experiments on plain composite laminates, polymeric sandwich panels and FMLs. The influence of loading distribution, materials and test geometry on the failure of composites is discussed.

Life time prediction based on failure analysis is therefore essential for many applications in Aeronautics, Automotive and Civil Engineering. Analysis of Failure in Fiber Polymer Laminates presents Alfred PuckÂ´s failure model, which, among several other theories, predicts fracture limits best and describes the failure phenomena in FRP most realistically - as confirmed within the “World-wide Failure Exercise”. Using PuckÂ´s model the composite engineer can follow the gradual failure process in a laminate and deduce from the results of the analysis how to improve the laminate design. This capability distinguishes the model from other phenomenological and global models. It thus reduces the number of required component tests and iteration loops in the design process and paves the way to sorely needed software for crash-simulation of FRP-structures.",

These models are critically reviewed and the scarcity of analytical studies on FMLs is revealed. The importance of the plate deformation during impact loading is emphasised and recommendations are given on the development of a quasi-static energy-balance model integrated into a structural theory.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) results obtained from samples with nanoclay indicated that intergallery spacing of the layered clay increases with matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) gave a morphological picture of the cross-sections and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) allowed investigating the elemental composition of matrix in composites. The testing results indicated that the flexural properties are greatly increased at 4% of nanoclay loading while impact, hardness and water absorption properties are increased at 6% of nanoclay loading. A plausible explanation for high increase of properties has also been discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize the delamination fracture of continuous carbon fiber/epoxy multidirectional-laminates under Mode I, Mode II and Mixed-Mode I/II loading conditions. The present study considers the variation of the interlaminar failure energy, G C, with the extent of crack jumping, and ensuing fiber bridging, which arises during the growth of the delamination in the multidirectional-laminates under the various modes of loading. The main type of laminate which was studied was a multidirectional fiber composite prepared from 24 ply lay-ups of (-45°/0°/+45°) 2S(+45°/0°/-45°) 2S. The initial delamination was located at the +45°/-45° mid-plane of the specimen. It has been found that when the values of the interlaminar fracture energy, G C, are ascertained as a function of the length of the propagating crack, a, then very complex relationships are observed. This was the case for all the different modes of loading, and these observations reflected the complex failure paths which occurred as the delamination propagated through the multidirectional fiber composites. It was, however, possible to define clearly the onset of crack initiation. These results also revealed that the values for the interlaminar fracture energy, G C (initiation), at crack initiation for the (-45°/0°/+45°) 2S(+45°/0°/-45°) 2S multidirectional laminates were always significantly greater than that for the corresponding unidirectional (i.e., 0°/0°) laminates. © 1999 Technomic Publishing Co., Inc.",

Experimental results showed that fiber failure is a prominent phenomenon and an important reason for the knee point on the dent depth-impact energy curves of composite laminates subjected to low-velocity impact. The finite element model to predict the permanent indentation incorporated fiber failure in the anisotropic elasto-plasticity theory. Delamination was also taken into account in the finite element model using cohesive elements. The permanent indentation numerically predicted agreed well with the experimental results. Composite laminates with different fiber-resin systems were analyzed which showed that the effect of different materials especially different fibers on the permanent indentation can be reflected in the present model. Numerical results showed different ways of energy dissipation which also reflected different damage modes before and after the knee point. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

A micromechanics model which accounts for the transverse shear stress effect, the effect of strain rate dependency and the effect of inelasticity is used for analyzing the mechanical responses of the fiber and matrix constituents. The accuracy of the micromechanics model under transverse shear loading is verified by comparing the results with those obtained using a general purpose finite element code. A higher order laminated plate theory is extended to capture the inelastic deformations of the composite plate and is implemented using the finite element technique. A complete micro-macro numerical procedure is developed to model the strain rate dependent behavior of inelastic composite laminates by implementing the micromechanics model into the finite element model. Parametric studies of the transient responses of composite plates are conduced. The effects of geometry, ply stacking sequence, material models, boundary conditions and loadings are investigated. The results show that the strain rate dependency and inelasticity influence the transient responses of composite plates via two significantly different mechanisms. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "This paper first considers the mechanics for predicting stress transfer in a general symmetric laminate, having a uniform distribution of ply cracks in a single orientation, subject to combined general in-plane and through-thickness loading. The effects of residual stresses arising from thermal expansion mismatch are taken into account. The paper extends an existing stress transfer model so that the effect of through-thickness loading can be considered. The second step is the extension of an existing framework for the formulation of criteria that can be used to predict the progressive formation of ply cracks during complex loading. The effective stress/strain relations for a damaged laminate are shown to be identical in form to those of an undamaged laminate. By considering ply crack closure conditions, a series of very useful inter-relationships between thermo-elastic constants for damaged and corresponding undamaged laminates are derived. In particular, it is shown that a single damage dependent function controls the dependence of all thermo-elastic constants on the state of ply cracking. This function has been determined from stress transfer analysis for the special case of uniform ply crack distributions having a single orientation. The inter-relationships between thermoelastic constants enable the derivation of crack formation criteria that are relatively simple in form.

Using a drop weight test rig, specimens were impacted at initial impact energies of 4 J and 6 J using steel hemispherical, ogival and conical impactors, all 12 mm in diameter. The specimens impacted by the conical impactor absorbed most energy as a result of local penetration. The hemispherical impactor produced the highest peak force and lowest contact duration as expected. Only the hemispherical impactor at an initial impact energy of 4J produced barely visible impact damage (BVID) whereas the other impactor shapes produced permanent indentation and penetration. Destructive testing techniques are required to determine the internal damage mechanisms since non-destructive inspection (NDI) techniques provided similar damage areas for the three impactor shapes. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a computational study of the tensile strength prediction of open-hole laminates using a cohesive zone model. To the authors&#039; knowledge, it is for the first time in the literature that the thickness-dependence of translaminar fracture toughness is accounted for in the numerical modelling of composites. The thickness size effect in the strength of open-hole composite laminates failed by pull-out is accurately predicted for the first time by a deterministic model. It is found that neglecting delamination in the numerical models will lead to mesh-dependency and over-estimation on the predicted strength. Smeared crack model with cohesive elements to model delamination is able to predict the correct failure mode; but it is found not suitable for accurate strength predictions for laminates failed by delamination. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The systems include unsized, epoxy-amine compatible, and epoxy-amine incompatible glass fibers. The high displacement rates that induce high-strain-rate interphase loading were obtained by using the rapid expansion capability of piezoelectric actuators (PZT). The results of dynamic micro-debonding experiments showed that the values of interphase strength and specific absorbed energies varied in a manner that is dependent on the sizing and exhibited significant sensitivity to loading rates. The unsized fibers exhibit greater frictional sliding energies that could provide better ballistic resistance, while the compatible sized fibers show higher strength values that improve the structural integrity of the polymeric composites. In addition, significantly higher amounts of energy are absorbed within the frictional sliding regime compared to debonding. By using the experimental data obtained, a case study was performed to reveal the importance of the interphase related micro damage modes on energy absorption (and therefore ballistic performance) of glass/epoxy composite armor.",

          "abstract": "The fracture strength of notched continuous fiber-reinforced composite laminates with arbitrary lamination geometry has been predicted by focusing on the interlaminar crack extension around notches. An equation was first derived which evaluated the energy release rate at a point on the interlaminar crack front. Then, under the condition of constant energy release rate, a numerical simulation was carried out of the extension behavior of the delaminated zone. Taking account of its interaction with intralaminar cracks and the probabilistic failure process of fibers inside the delaminated zone, the simulated fracture behavior of laminates was found to be in good agreement with experimental results. These simulation results lead to a fracture-strength prediction for laminates which is proved to be sufficiently precise over a wide-ranging variety of lamination geometries.",

          "abstract": "Dyneema® composites exhibit remarkable mechanical performance over a wide range of quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. The principal objective of the present study is to develop a constitutive model for their large-strain intralaminar shear deformation: one of the important characteristics governing dynamic performance of composite plates. To this end, tensile tests were conducted on cross-ply composite specimens in the [±45°] orientation. In parallel, an analytical model based on a binary representation of the constituent phases was developed and validated using finite element analyses. The results show that the rapid hardening in the stress-strain curve is attributable to rotations of fibers in the plastic domain. At large plastic strains (&gt;0.1), the tests show that the composites begin to undergo dilatation: a consequence of microstructural damage. In this domain, the model predictions of the stress-strain response (neglecting damage) exceed those measured experimentally; further study is needed to ascertain the underlying damage mechanisms. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Carbon/epoxy composites have been used in critical parts of aircraft such as wing box, fuselage and empennage. Apparently, some areas are prone to impact damage, and therefore, interlaminar strength is of prime concern. One method to improve interlaminar strength is to use textile yarns to bind fabric preforms prior to curing process. Albeit effective, such through-thickness reinforcement may alter the in-plane mechanical behavior of composites. During the design phase using stitched composites, certain parameters are considered, e.g. stitch orientation, to ensure that the in-plane response is still acceptable. In addition to that, presence of geometrical changes such as cut-outs may complicate the issue at hand. Therefore, evaluation of stitched composites containing geometrical changes is critical. Present paper reports the influence of stitch orientation on the tensile behavior of stitched plain weave with and without circular holes. Two stitch orientations are discussed: longitudinal direction (parallel to the loading direction) and transverse direction (perpendicular to the loading direction). Experiment shows that specimens with transverse stitches suffer 24% reduction of tensile strength and failure strain. The reduction is attributed to the stitch-induced misalignment of the load-bearing tows in transverse stitched specimen. Tensile modulus, however, does not show sensitivity to the stitch orientation. Failure mechanism for different stitch orientations is elucidated by microscopic observation. It is revealed that in the specimen with longitudinal stitches, the crack initiation may originate from the resin-rich region around the stitch hole, and the crack subsequently propagates rapidly throughout the width of specimen. While the crack initiation site is similar for the transverse stitched specimens, the crack progression would occur along the stitch lines. Microscopic observation also reveals that the plain-weave laminates eventually fail by brittle fracture regardless the stitch orientation. In open hole specimens, the role of stress concentration around the hole outperforms the fiber misalignment effect. Stress measurement confirms that normal stress distribution and KT are insensitive to the stitch orientation. Lekhnitskii theory (1968) is also employed to predict the stress distribution, and the theory is found in a good agreement with experiment. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The simplest definition employs a unidirectional variation based on a linear function for the fiber orientation angle of the individual layers. Analyses of variable stiffness panels for in-plane and buckling responses are developed and demonstrated for two distinct cases of stiffness variations. The first case assumes a stiffness variation in the direction of the loading, and numerical results indicate small improvements in buckling load for some panel configurations due to favorable distribution of the transverse stresses over the panel planform. The second case varies the stiffness perpendicular to the loading, and provides a much higher degree of improvement due to the re-distribution of the applied loads. It is also demonstrated that the variable stiffness concept provides a flexibility to the designer for trade-offs between overall panel stiffness and buckling load, in that there exist many configurations with equal buckling loads yet different global stiffness values, or vice versa. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The computed slopes of the modified Paris plots were high. Therefore, threshold values of the strain energy release rate for delamination growth were determined. Low fatigue threshold values revealed a significant effect of fatigue loading. The largest effect was found for the ENF test (Mode II) for which the fatigue threshold value was only 10% of the critical strain energy release rate in static tests. Threshold values for MMB (mixed mode) and DCB (Mode I) tests were 15% and 23% of the static values, respectively. Fractographic evaluation revealed identical initial failure mechanisms in fatigue and static loading conditions for the ENF specimen. The ENF specimen failed by formation and coalescence of microcracks. The low fatigue threshold for the ENF specimen was explained by microscopical observations on the specimen edge. It was also shown that the fracture surfaces generated in static and fatigue DCB and MMB tests were similar.",

This method was essentially an impact version of the ENF (End Notched Flexure) test using SHPB (Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar) technique, where a slow-gradient ramped incident stress wave was utilized to reduce the kinematic effects on the behavior of the specimen and consequently the dynamic energy release rate was calculated by a simple estimation formula based on static beam theory and compliance method. The validity and limitation of this method were investigated on the basis of finite element results. The stress state and deformation mode of the specimen under impact loading were shown to be approximately equal to those under quasi-static loading when the incident stress wave of adequate amplitude and rise time was applied to the specimen. In addition, the estimation error of this method was shown to be reduced by calculating the energy release rate from the surface strain of the specimen. The experimental results by this method showed that the mode II interlaminar fracture toughness of carbon-fiber/epoxy composite laminates under impact loading was somewhat lower than that under quasi-static loading. © 1998 Trans Tech Publications.",

First, monotonic and loading/unloading tensile tests were conducted on dry and wet specimens at ambient and high temperatures to compare the stress/strain response and damage development. The changes in the Young&#039;s modulus and Poisson&#039;s ratio were obtained experimentally from the monotonic tensile tests. The critical stresses for transverse cracking and delamination for the above three conditions are compared. The delamination area is measured by using scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) at various loads to discuss the effects of delamination on the nonlinear stress/strain behavior. Next, the stress distributions under tensile load including hygrothermal residual stresses are computed by a finite-element code and their effects on damage initiation are discussed. Finally, a simple model for the prediction of the Young&#039;s modulus of a delaminated specimen is proposed. It is found that moisture increases the critical stresses for transverse cracking and delamination by reducing the residual stresses while high temperature decreases the critical stresses in spite of relaxation of the residual stresses. The results of the finite-element analysis provide some explanations for the onset of transverse cracking and delamination. The Young&#039;s modulus predicted by the present model agrees with experimental results better than that predicted by conventional models.",

The model simulates the damage progress and subsequent material property degradation of composite laminates and predicts their fatigue life by using a three-stage procedure. In the first stage, state of stresses in the whole component is specified. Then, multi-axial stresses of each element are utilized to damage assessment by using a newly developed damage estimation technique. Considering each element as an orthotropic material, stiffness degradation due to the induced damage is calculated based on two sets of material property degradation rules. For this aim, a generalized approach is used for gradual and sudden material property degradation. In order to evaluate the model, a macro program is developed that simulates the fatigue behavior of unidirectional and multidirectional composite laminates. The results of the model are consistent with available experimental data. Using this program, some fatigue life predictions are also accomplished for laminates with arbitrary stacking sequences.",

To ensure the low cost of applying fibre-reinforced materials in automotive vehicles, it is proposed to selectively incorporate carbon fibres to enhance glass fibre composites along main loading path. This paper investigates the influences of stacking sequence of on the strength of hybrid composites comprising materials with differing stiffness and strength. Hybrid composite laminates were manufactured using varying ratio of glass woven fabric and carbon woven fabric in an epoxy matrix. Static tests including tension, compression and three-point-bending were carried out to composite coupons containing various ratios of carbon fibres to glass fibres. The results show that hybrid composite laminates with 50% carbon fibre reinforcement provide the best flexural properties when the carbon layers are at the exterior, while the alternating carbon/glass lay-up provides the highest compressive strength. The tensile strength is insensitive to the stacking sequence. Analytical solutions are also developed and are shown to provide good correlation with the experimental data, which allow the optimisation of stacking sequence of hybrid composites to achieve the maximum strength. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The methodology is best suited for non-linear structural analysis of large-scale laminated composites whose boundaries do not interfere/interact with the damage zone that develops and grows within the structure. The new development presented here, CODAM2, addresses the deficiencies in both the numerical and material objectivity of the original version of CODAM. While the previous CODAM formulation was essentially a local smeared crack model that was augmented with crack band scaling to overcome one aspect of the numerical objectivity, namely the mesh-sensitivity, CODAM2 introduces a non-local regularisation scheme to alleviate both the spurious mesh dependency and mesh orientation problems that plague all local strain-softening models. Two of the 13 test cases, provided in the third-world wide failure exercise, which were related to the in-plane tensile and compressive loading of open hole specimens, were used in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of CODAM2 in predicting the damage development and the corresponding overall response in such structural loading configurations. © The Author(s) 2013.",

The laminate is a sandwich with a fiber reinforced epoxy ply (prepreg) in the middle and an aluminum alloy layer on each of the outer surfaces. Dugdale strip yielding zones in the aluminum layers at the crack tip are assumed to take into account ductile deformations of the metal layers. It is also assumed that a strip damage zone in the prepreg layer is developed at the crack tip reflecting matrix cracking and fiber breakage and pull-out. Residual strengths for the centrally cracked laminates are calculated numerically. It is found that the residual strength of CARALL (carbon fiber reinforced polymer/aluminum laminate) is always higher than that of ARALL?? (using aramid fiber instead of carbon fiber) for both infinite and finite width plates in the range of initial crack lengths considered. The strengths of CARALL with high elongation (HE) fiber are also higher than those of their metal counterparts. The results for ARALL predicted from the present model agree well with the existing experimental observations. The residual strength results for cracked MFCLs suggest that CARALL, especially with HE fibers, may replace aluminum alloys in lower aircraft wings and fuselage because of its higher residual strength and lower density.

Methods The approach is based on the detailed meso-scale representation of a composite laminate. Material models suitable for explicit modeling of laminate structure, including fiber-reinforced layers and resin-rich regions, are described. Two numerical impact tests with significantly different impact energies were conducted on thermoplastic AS4/PEEK materials with quasi-isotropic layups. Simulations employed both SPH and Finite element methods. Results Results of simulations are verified against experimental data available from the literature and demonstrate good correlation with the experiments. Conclusions Developed modeling approach can be used in simulations where post-impact damage progression in composite material is of the main focus.",

Two sets of beams were tested in this study: control beams (without CFRP laminates) and damaged and then repaired beams with different amounts of CFRP laminates by varying different parameters (damage degree, CFRP laminate width, concrete strength class). All beams were tested in four-point bending over a span of 1800 mm. The tests were carried out under displacement control. The most investigated parameter in this experimental study is damage degree (ratio between pre-cracked load and load capacity of control beam). Repairing damaged RC beams with externally bonded CFRP laminates were successful for different degrees of damage. The observed failure modes were peeling off and interfacial debonding. These failure modes depend only on the laminate width. The results indicate that the load capacity and the rigidity of repaired beams were significantly higher then those of control beam for all tested damage degrees. The authors remarked that for a load capacity improvement, reinforcement with a CFRP having about a half width of the beam is satisfactory. Finally, the contribution of CFRP laminates on the load capacity and rigidity of repaired RC beams is significant for any concrete strength class. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The design of composite structures or components, subject to extreme loading conditions, such as crash, blast, etc. requires a fundamental understanding of the deterioration mechanism within the composite meso-structure. Existing predictive techniques for the analysis of composite structures and components near and beyond their ultimate strength are either based on simple scalar stress functions, or use very complex damage formulations with many material constants, some of which may be difficult to characterise. This paper presents a simple damage mechanics based progressive failure model for thin woven carbon composites under impact loading. The approach is based on an unconventional thermodynamic maximum energy dissipation approach, which entails controlling damage evolution and hence energy dissipation per second, rather than damage. The method has been implemented into the explicit dynamic finite element code DYNA3D. Numerical simulation results using the proposed model are compared with two experimental impact tests. The analysis methodology proposed in this paper reflects a very simple, but effective technique that can be used to model a wide range of problems from extreme events, such as crash or blast, to birdstrike, when tearing and perforation are major failure mechanisms. As damage is cumulative, the technique allows initial or/and post-impact static loads to be applied to the composite structure or component, thus allowing a cradle-to-grave design methodology. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The deformation and failure response of composite sandwich beams and panels under low velocity impact was reviewed and discussed. Sandwich facesheet materials discussed are unidirectional and woven carbon/epoxy, and wo-ven glass/vinylester composite laminates; sandwich core materials investigated include four types of closed cell PVC foams of various densities, aluminum honey-comb, polyurethane foam, foam-filled honeycomb, and balsa wood. These materials were fully characterized under quasi-static loading and, in some cases, under high strain loading conditions as well. Sandwich beams were tested in an instrumented drop tower system under various energy levels, where load and strain histories and failure modes were recorded for the various types of beams. Peak loads pre-dicted by spring-mass and energy balance models were in satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements. Failure patterns depend strongly on the impact energy levels and core properties. Failure modes observed include core indenta-tion/cracking, facesheet buckling, delamination within the facesheet, and debonding between the facesheet and core. Sandwic h beams with PVC cores tend to be more stable than beams with different cores. Although sandwich beams with balsa wood cores perform well under static loading, they fail catastrophically under impact load-ing due to the low fracture toughness along the grain direction. Sandwich beams with honeycomb cores show early catastrophic failure caused by the lack of con-tinuity of the interface between the hone ycomb core and the facesheet, resulting in debonding failure. In the case of sandwich panels, it was shown that static and impact loads of the same magnitude produce very similar far-field deformations. The induced damage is localized and is lower for impact loading than for an equiv-alent static loading. Static testing in general is more conservative regarding strain and damage levels. The load history, predicted by a model based on the sinusoidal shape of the impact load pulse, was in agr eement with experimental results. A finite element model was implemented to capture the full response of the panel indenta-tion. The investigation of post-impact behavior of sandwich structures shows that, although impact damage may not be readily visible, its effects on the residual me-chanical properties of the structure can be quite detrimental.",

          "abstract": "A method is developed to predict numerically the damage of composite laminates with more plies under low velocity impact loading. The Puck criterion for 3D stress states is adopted to model the intralaminar damage including matrix cracking and fiber breakage, and to obtain the orientation of the fracture plane due to matrix failure. According to interlaminar delamination mechanism, a new delamination criterion is proposed. The influence of transverse and through-thickness normal stress, interlaminar shear stress and damage conditions of adjacent plies on delamination is considered. In order to quickly and efficiently predict the impact-induced damage of composite laminates with more plies, an approach, which can predict the specific damage of several plies in a single solid element, is proposed by interpolation on the strains of element integration points. Moreover, the proposed model can predict specific failure modes. A good agreement between the predicted delamination shapes and sizes and the experimental results shows correctness of the developed numerical method for predicting low velocity impact damage on composite laminates.",

Two types of fiber optic sensors, namely fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) and Doppler effect-based fiber optic (FOD) sensors, were addressed and guided wave detection systems were constructed for both types. Guided waves generated by a piezoelectric transducer were propagated through a quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate and acquired by these fiber optic sensors. Characteristics of these fiber optic sensors in ultrasonic guided wave detection were systematically compared. Results demonstrated that both the FBG and FOD sensors can be applied in guided wave and damage detection for the CFRP laminates. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of guided wave signal captured by an FOD sensor is relatively high in comparison with that of the FBG sensor because of their different physical principles in ultrasonic detection. Further, the FOD sensor is sensitive to the damage-induced fundamental shear horizontal (SH(0)) guided wave that, however, cannot be detected by using the FBG sensor, because the FOD sensor is omnidirectional in ultrasound detection and, in contrast, the FBG sensor is severely direction dependent.",

Acoustic emission monitoring during fatigue testing has shown that the amplitude distribution of the acoustic events shifts from predominantly low amplitude (40–55 dB), associated with matrix cracking, in as-received specimens, to intermediate amplitude (55–75 dB) associated with delamination and debonding after pre-exposure. Optical microscopy of fatigued samples has verified these failure mode changes.

The conventional techniques for strengthening of substandard bridges are costly, time consuming, and labor intensive. Many new techniques have used the lightweight, high strength, and the corrosion resistance of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) laminates for repair and retrofit applications. The load-carrying capacity of a steel-concrete composite girder can be improved significantly by epoxy bonding carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) laminates to its tension flange. This paper presents the results of a study on the behavior of steel-concrete composite girders strengthened with CFRP sheets under static loading. A total of three large-scale composite girders made of W355×13.6 A36 steel beam and 75-mm thick by 910-mm wide concrete slab were prepared and tested. The thickness of the CFRP sheet was constant and a different number of layers of 1, 3, and 5 were used in the specimens. The test results showed that epoxy-bonded CFRP sheet increased the ultimate load-carrying capacity of steel-concrete composite girders and the behavior can be conservatively predicted by traditional methods.",

The recommended experiments are to measure the density of microcracks as a function of applied stress. Such results can be fit with the energy release rate expression and used to measure the microcracking or intralaminar fracture toughness. The measured microcracking fracture toughnesses are: Hercules AS4/3501-6-240 J/m2, Fiberite 934/T300—690 J/m2, DuPont Avimid® K Polymer/IM6-960 J/m2, Fiberite 977-2/T300-1800 to 2400 J/m2, and ICI PEEK/AS4- 3000 J/m2.

The method was unable to accurately predict the fiber stress relaxation due to longitudinal splitting, which in the case of laminates with holes is of paramount importance for the accurate prediction of ultimate strength. Three-dimensional ply level modeling of discrete damage near an open hole in a quasi-isotropic composite laminate was subsequently considered. Normally the mesh configuration is dictated by the boundaries of the specimen, such as the presence of a hole, creating formidable difficulties to modeling matrix cracking, which is aligned with the fiber direction in a given ply. A mesh independent displacement discontinuity modeling method based on higher order shape functions was constructed for this purpose. The surface of the displacement jump associated with matrix cracking was defined in terms of the domain Heaviside function approximated by using higher order polynomial B-splines. Moire interferometry was used to determine the strain and displacement fields in the surface layers of a quasi-isotropic composite, previously prestressed beyond the damage initiation load. Good correlation between the experimental data and the stress redistribution predicted by the mesh independent damage modeling technique was observed",

DIC based methodology gives direct measure of the displacement field using a well defined formulation of matching the images of loaded and load free component, so that displacement vectors can be evaluated for a certain number of grid reference points on the analysed surface. In this work, the authors present the latest research with this method, and analyse fatigue damage phenomena in GFRC laminates under tensile fatigue load employing notched and notch-free specimens. Damage analysis based on optical DIC technique has been performed to detect the damaged areas on the specimen surface and to follow failure mechanisms during lifetime; the damage evolution in composites was performed monitoring two parameters: the local hysteresis area of stress strain cycles, the local stiffness variation. These parameters are evaluated on a grid by means of DIC strain measurements during the entire fatigue life showing encouraging results.",

It was found that the loading rate has a strong effect on almost every feature of the stress-strain curve: the proportionality stress, the composite strength and failure strain increase with increasing loading rate. The microstructural damage varies also with the loading rate; with increasing loading rate, the average matrix crack spacing increases and the average fiber pullout length decreases. Using simple models, it is suggested that these phenomena are caused partly by time-dependent matrix cracking (due to stress corrosion) and partly by an increasing interfacial shear stress with loading rate.",

Aiming towards a better characterization of the possibilities offered by these materials, the research work reported here investigates the shear response of small masonry assemblages strengthened externally with sheets made of glass and aramid fiber reinforced polymer laminates. An alternative strengthening approach provided by microlaminated wood is also investigated. The assemblages, consisting of masonry couplets, were subjected to combined shear and axial loading and were laid to failure through monotonic and cyclic loading processes. The efficiency of the different strengthening materials is investigated by comparison with measures obtained for unreinforced assemblages subjected to similar load conditions. The research is aimed at characterizing the contribution of the different strengthening materials and arrangements to increase both the peak shear strength and the residual (post-peak) shear strength. An attempt is made to analytically describe the strengthening effect of reinforcement. For this purpose, two different effects provided by the reinforcing laminates - the increase of friction at the brick-mortar interface and the shear strength of the laminate itself - are considered. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The present work uses laminates with special stacking sequences allowing for isolating the orientation parameter. Multidirectional DCB specimens were designed so as to obtain an uncoupled quasi isotropic and quasi-homogeneous elastic behavior, with the same properties for the entire laminate and the two sub laminates separated by the pre crack at mid-plane. The results show that the toughness in term of GIC is slightly affected by the variation of ply orientations at the crack interface. The differences are more pronounced in the crack propagation behavior after the initiation point. Even with the same orientation at the crack interface, different subsequent ply orientations can also lead to different crack resistance behavior. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Our analysis of the conventional propagation tests makes use of the links existing between the critical-energy release rates and some of the model&#039;s parameters. In taking into account the part of the energy dissipated inside the layers, the interfaces can be classified into two categories: the 0°/0° interfaces of brittle behaviour, and the itnerfaces at disorientated angles whose critical-energy release rate is greater. Standard edge-delamination tension tests are also conducted and analysed in order to identify the other parameters of the interface damage model.",

          "abstract": "High performance composite materials, such as Carbon-Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) composites, are being increasingly used in aerospace industry, such as fuselage primary structures in Boeing 787 or Airbus 350, where high strength and stiffness are required at minimum weight [1]. The design of composite structures frequently includes discontinuities such as cut-outs for access and fastener holes for joining and they become critical regions under thermo-mechanical loading. Understanding of notched specimen behaviour is necessary for the design of complex structures where parts are mostly connected with bolts and rivets [2]. The effect of these discontinuities on the behaviour of composite materials is an important topic because it causes a relatively large reduction in strength compared to the unnotched laminate [3]. In the first part of the current work, the assessment of the damage process taking place in notched (open-hole) specimens under uniaxial tensile loading was studied. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques were employed to obtain full-field surface strain measurements in carbon-fibre/epoxy M21/T700 composite plates with different stacking sequences in the presence of an open circular hole. Penetrant enhanced X-ray radiographs were taken to identify damage location and extent after loading around the hole. DIC strain fields were compared to numerical predictions. In the second part of the study, DIC techniques were used to characterise damage and performance of adhesively bonded patch repairs in composite panels under tensile loading. This part of work relates to strength/stiffness restoration of damaged composite aircraft that becomes more important as composites are used more extensively in the construction of modern jet airliners. In the current work, external bonded patches have been studied. Adhesively bonded repairs are the most common type of repair carried out with composite materials [1,4]. The behaviour of bonded patches under loading was monitored using DIC full-field strain measurements. Location and extent of damage identified by X-ray radiography correlates well with DIC strain results giving confidence to the technique for structural health monitoring of bonded patches. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The structural weight of a cryogenic propellant tank for reusable launch vehicles (RLV) can be effectively reduced by the use of advanced composite materials. However, microscopic damage such as transverse matrix cracks (TMC) and delaminations are prone to develop in composites well below the load levels that would result in mechanical failure. This microscopic damage leads to a leakage path for the fuel. The leakage is influenced by many factors, including pressure gradients, microcrack density, connectivity of the cracks, residual stresses from manufacture, service-induced stresses from thermal and mechanical loads, and composite stacking sequence. It is expected that there is a direct relationship between leakage and damage opening but the connectivity of matrix cracks is also a major factor affecting the leakage. In this article, the leakage rate through the damage network is discussed based on earlier studies for the opening of damage paths due to TMC and delamination, including the TMC intersection area. In order to examine the leakage process, numerical simulations are performed using the computational fluid dynamics software (FLUENT) and the effective conductance of the leakage paths is estimated. A simplified model is also developed to predict the effective conductance. The flow resistance in the TMC and the resistance of the TMC intersection area are accounted for in the calculation of the effective conductance of the leakage path through the entire laminate using the simplified model. Comparisons between the numerical solution for a five-ply composite with interconnected leakage paths and the prediction of the simplified model are presented for gaseous hydrogen flow through the thickness of the composite at room and cryogenic temperatures. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",

          "abstract": "The degradation of laminated composite materials under service loading occurs by means of a complex combination of damage modes and damage mechanisms. These damage events combine to produce a damage state which controls the state of stress and the state of strength of the degraded laminate. Although data have been generated dealing with various details of this process, an understanding or philosophy of the precise nature of damage development has not, heretofore, been developed. This paper makes such an attempt for the general case of damage development in laminated plates under cyclic (fatigue) loading. The philosophy is based on the discovery of a &#039;characteristic damage state&#039; in such plates which forms independently of load history, and is determined only by the properties of the laminae, their orientations, and their stacking sequence. The detailed nature of this characteristic damage state, the nature of its formation, and its influence on strength, life and stiffness is discussed. The general need for further work in this, and related fields is also assessed. ?? 1980.",

Thus, an investigation of the low velocity impact on laminated composite plate of epoxy resin reinforced by carbon fiber is presented.

The results have shown that the value of GIIc for many composites is rate-sensitive, tending to increase with increasing loading rate. Damage development in the crack tip region has been investigated by examining the polished edges of a number of test specimens in a scanning electron microscope. It has also been shown that offsetting the center plies by a few degrees in order to reduce fiber bridging results in a greater degree of rate-sensitivity in GIIc. It is believed that the presence of fiber-bridging in standard unidirectional fracture-mechanics samples conceals much of the intrinsic viscoelastic response of the polymeric matrix. Failure mechanisms at the crack tip have been investigated using the Double Edge Notch Flexure specimen. A scanning electron microscope study of this region has shown that the size and nature of this zone is dependent upon the crosshead displacement rate.",

The use of acoustic emission (AE) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations has enabled us to identify several damage mechanisms.

          "abstract": "SUMMARY: Manufacturing composite laminates made of epoxy resin matrix and long carbon fibers is divided into several operations. The most critical one is the cross-linking stage of the thermoset resin. During this phase, uncured prepreg plies&#039; stacking is transformed into a structural laminate by the achievement of a three dimensional macromolecular resin network. A question of matter is the quality of the polymerization process. If not optimized, it gives birth to defects in the bulk material, such as voids. These defects are considered as possible sources of damage in the composite parts. The aim of this work is to model the evolution of void growth processes in thermoset composite laminates. Diffusion phenomena of gas molecules in resin are neglected for the moment, in order to focus on the study of the viscous effects of the polymer on the gas bubbles entrapped in the fluid. After the models are set and validated, an optimization study is proposed to determine the best temperature and pressure cycles in order to minimize the final void radius.",

          "abstract": "This chapter describes a micromechanical prediction procedure to simulate the progressive failure strength of a composite laminate subjected to multiaxial loading. Essentially, two steps are observed in the simulation of a multidirectional laminate. The chapter explains the first step in which a laminate analysis is performed using the classical lamination theory. The purpose of the laminate analysis is to obtain the in-plane strain and curvature increments of the laminate and further to determine the stresses sheared by each lamina in the laminate. The most important quantity involved in this step analysis is the instantaneous stiffness matrix of the lamina, which will be used to construct the laminate overall stiffness matrix. A recently developed micromechanics model, the bridging model, is used to define this instantaneous stiffness matrix and to relate the stress increments in the constituent fiber and resin materials of the lamina with those stress increments exerted on it. The thermal residual stresses generated in the constituents because of mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion in the fiber and resin materials are addressed and have been incorporated in the analysis. As long as one of the constituents attains its ultimate stress state, the lamina is considered to have failed and its contribution to the overall stiffness matrix of the laminate is reduced. The chapter presents a total reduction strategy. In this way, the progressive failure process in the laminate can be understood and the corresponding failure mode can be identified automatically. A generalized maximum normal stress criterion is adopted to detect the constituent failure. The prediction procedure has been applied to 14 different composite laminates, where failure envelopes or stress-strain curves up to final failure subjected to biaxial loading are required. The predicted results are reported in figures and data tables.",

Experiments were performed on graphite-epoxy composite specimens having different laminate stacking sequences and a range of scaled sizes. From the experiments it was deduced that the elastic response of scaled composite specimens was independent of size. However, a significant scale effect in strength was observed. In addition, a transition in failure mode was observed among scaled specimens of certain laminate stacking se quences. A Weibull statistical model and a fracture mechanics based model were applied to predict the strength scale effect since standard failure criteria cannot account for the in fluence of absolute specimen size on strength.",

The interply frictional resistances of prepreg stacks were studied with the surface morphology observation and the surface roughness measurements. The results indicate that the friction mechanism of the two prepreg systems is the mixed friction, which could change from the Coulomb-dominated friction to the hydrodynamic-dominated friction under different processing conditions. The surface morphology and surface roughness of prepreg have significant effects on the slipping behavior controlled by the mixed friction. The Coulomb-dominated friction is not conducive to the slippage of prepreg and may result in fiber wrinkles in the laminates.

It is known that through-thickness residual stresses are introduced in unsymmetric laminates during the manufacturing process. In this research work, a combined experimental-numerical analysis is proposed to study the effect of moisture ingress on unsymmetric composite laminates by analysing through-thickness residual stresses at dry and saturation states. A range of unsymmetric cross-ply laminates were manufactured using carbon-fibre epoxy pre-preg material. The laminates were subsequently immersed in water to full saturation. The curvatures of dry and saturated test coupons were measured and compared to quantify the effects of moisture ingress on the shapes of the unsymmetric laminates. In addition, a finite element model was developed to predict the experimentally measured curvatures of the dry laminates. By calibrating the numerical model, the through-thickness residual stresses were analysed for different unsymmetric cross-ply layup conditions. The calibrated dry model was then extended to develop a moisture-dependent numerical model in order to incorporate the effect of moisture ingress on the shapes of unsymmetric laminates. The moisture-dependent model was calibrated with the experimentally measured curvatures and then used to predict the through-thickness residual stresses in the fully saturated unsymmetric cross-ply laminates. It is shown that moisture ingress can considerably influence through-thickness residual stresses and thus the shapes of unsymmetric laminates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The focus of the present article is to recommend a systematic approach for selecting the architecture of long-fiber fabric reinforcements in FRP composite structures under impact events. Namely, nine design criteria were selected and quantified for four types of PP/glass laminates through drop tower impact testing under 200J energy, four-point flexural bending before and after impact, as well as microtomographic damage analysis of impacted samples. Subsequently, ranking of the candidate laminates was found using a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) technique to aid in selecting the overall best performing fiber reinforcement option under the presence of conflicting and inter-dependent design attributes.",

A correlation between stiffness reduction and the development of the various types of damage, such as transverse and longitudinal intraply cracking or delamination growth, has been made by various authors. However, the in-situ monitoring of fibre fracture occurring during static or fatigue loading in cfrp laminates has not yet been made except by indirect methods. The measurement of the variation of the electrical resistivity during loading promises to be a valuable technique for this purpose. In the case of a conventional metal sample, the conductivity is essentially the same for any direction of current flow through the sample. In cfrp samples, however, the conductivity is not isotropic and depends on the orientation and on the conductivity of the carbon fibres. Changes in the conductivity can therefore be related to fibre fracture. The resistivity also varies with temperature, and it is therefore necessary to correlate resistivity changes with the temperature changes observed during a fatigue test. The resistivity of cfrp laminates is further dependent on the applied load, the fibre volume fraction, the laminate stacking sequence and the fibre type. Knowing all of these factors, it is possible to correlate the change in the electrical resistivity with damage and failure of the load-bearing 0?? fibres. However, the technique can also be used to monitor continuously the actual load situation in a composite component. ?? 1989.",

The model is capable of simulating the residual stiffness, residual strength and fatigue life of composite laminates with arbitrary geometry and stacking sequence under complicated fatigue loading conditions. The model is an integration of three major components: stress analysis, failure analysis, and material property degradation rules. A three-dimensional, nonlinear, finite element technique is developed for the stress analysis. By using a large number of elements near the edge of the stress concentration and at layer interfaces, the edge effect has been accounted for. Each element is considered to be an orthotropic material under multiaxial state of stress. Using the three-dimensional state of stress within each element, different failure modes of a unidirectional ply under multiaxial states of stress are detected by a set of fatigue failure criteria. An analytical technique, called the generalized residual material property degradation technique, is established to degrade the material properties of elements. This analytical technique is not restricted to the application of failure criteria to limited applied stress ratios. Based on the model, a computer code is developed that simulates cycle-by-cycle behaviour of composite laminates under fatigue loading.",

This paper presents the results of an extensive experimental campaign conducted to investigate the feasibility of using vibration-based methods to identify damages sustained by composite laminates due to low-velocity impacts. The experimental programme included an evaluation of impact damage resistance and tolerance according to ASTM test methods, characterisation of induced damage by ultrasonic testing and quantification of the effects on the vibration response. The damage identification involved the detection, localisation, quantification and estimation of the remaining bearing capacity. Four damage indicators based on modal parameters were assessed by comparing pristine and damaged states. The results allowed for conclusions to be drawn regarding the capability and suitability of each damage indicator, including its ability to detect impact-induced damage, its precision in determining the location of damage, its sensitivity regarding damage extent and pertinent correlations with residual bearing capacity.",

          "abstract": "Recently, natural fiber has been a focus for environmental and recyclable polymer composite, because of its excellent properties, such as low cost, low density, high specific strength and modulus. Vacuum assisted resin infusion (VARI) molding is an attractive manufacturing technique for natural fiber reinforced polymer composites with high quality and low cost. Because of low applied pressure of VARI and special compacting property of natural fiber fabric, how to increase natural fiber content of composite is a critical issue for improving the mechanical performances of composite fabricated by VARI. In this paper, ramie fabric/epoxy resin composite laminate was prepared using VARI. In order to increase ramie fiber content, pre-compaction operation on dry ramie fabric stack was carried out before injecting epoxy resin into the fiber fabric. Vacuum pressure compaction and hot compaction with high pressure and temperature were respectively used to compress the fiber stack, and the compaction responses of fabric stack under different vacuum pressure loading cycle and hot compaction conditions were studied. The morphology, structure and tensile property of ramie fiber before and after pre-compaction procedure were investigated and the compaction mechanism under different conditions was discussed. Moreover, the composite laminates using compacted ramie fabric were manufactured using VARI, and tensile, flexural and interlaminar shear properties were measured. It is found that hot compaction can significantly increase ramie fiber content and the mechanical properties of composites. However, when the temperature and pressure of hot compaction are beyond certain values, the mechanical properties of ramie fiber and its composite obviously decrease, indicating that hot compaction conditions have optimizing scope. © 2013.",

          "abstract": "One of the primary advantages of using fibre-reinforced laminated composites in structural design is the ability to change the stiffness and strength properties of the laminate by designing the laminate stacking sequence in order to improve its performance. This procedure is typically referred to as laminate tailoring. Traditionally, tailoring is done by keeping the fibre orientation angle within each layer constant throughout a structural component. Allowing the fibres to follow curvilinear paths within the plane of the laminates constitutes an advanced tailoring option that can lead to modification of load paths within the laminate to result in more favourable stress distributions and improve the laminate performance. Based on numerical simulations, the present work demonstrates the advantages of variable-stiffness over straight-fibre laminates in terms of compressive buckling and first-ply failure. A physically based set of failure criteria, able to predict the various modes of failure of a composite laminated structure, is implemented in finite element models of straight and variable-stiffness panels under compression. Non-linear analyses are carried out to simulate first-ply failure in the postbuckling regime. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

To this aim, instrumented impact tests were carried out on glass fabric/epoxy laminates of three different thicknesses, using different energy levels. The irreversibly absorbed energy was obtained from the force-displacement curves provided by the impact machine. To assess damage progression as a function of impact energy, ply-by-ply delamination and fibre breakages revealed by destructive tests were measured. A previous model, based on energy balance considerations, was applied to interpret the experimental results, together with an original method of data reduction, allowing for the isolation of the maximum energy portion due to indentation and vibrational effects. From the results obtained, the contribution of fibre breakage and matrix damage to the irreversibly absorbed energy is comparable at low impact energies; with increasing initial energy levels, delamination becomes predominant in determining energy dissipation. However, the critical energy-release rate required to propagate delamination, as calculated from impact data, is considerably higher than the typical values deriving from Mode II delamination tests performed under laboratory conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Composite structures in service are usually subject to complex loading conditions that can induce a stress field with two or even three dynamic principal stresses. The damage and failure analysis of composite structures should approximate the real loading conditions, which are able to produce a multiaxial stress field, in order to validate the load carrying capability. The biaxial experimental tests on cruciform composite specimens eliminate the free edges that are present in uniaxial experimental tests, and hence represent more realistic loading conditions in engineering structures. However, the constitutive and failure behaviors of composite materials under other than uniaxial stress states have not been thoroughly investigated. Although there are many failure theories being proposed for composite materials, they have not been verified by reliable biaxial experimental data for accurately analyzing and predicting the onset and propagation of failure under complex biaxial loads. The difficulties are due to the inhomogeneous and anisotropic nature of composite materials which unavoidably complicates the already complex biaxial test problems. In this paper, we propose to use peridynamic theory to model and analyze the damage and failure behaviors of cruciform composite specimens under biaxial loads. The primary advantage of the peridynamic model is that the same equations of motion with an integral formulation of interior forces apply across any damage sites, discontinuities, or dislocations. Hence, damage and discontinuity occur spontaneously and can involve complex patterns of damage propagation. The proposed peridynamic model is validated to be sufficiently comprehensive in predicting the different failure modes and strengths in cruciform biaxial tests. The simulation results agree fairly well with the experimental ones.",

          "abstract": "When subjected to low-velocity impacts, the high damage/sensitivity of carbon/epoxy laminated composites results in localised damage, mainly transverse cracks and delaminations. To be able to assess the critical nature of the induced damage, a thorough description of the damage mechanisms is of primary importance. The challenge here is the prediction of the initiation and the propagation of low-velocity impact-induced damage by the use of damage mechanics. Therefore, a mechanical and numerical model of the damage occurring in laminates, previously defined at Laboratoire de Mécanique et de Technologie (LMT) is updated to this specific type of loading. Preliminary results show a good correlation with accurate experimental measures. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the low velocity impact behavior of the carbon fiber aluminum laminates (CARALL). The purpose of the research is to study the applicability of carbon fiber in FMLs and the effect of the properties of aluminum alloy on the low velocity impact response of CARALL. A user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT) is used to define Hashin’s 3D damage constitutive model of composite. The numerical simulations using the progressive damage model have a good agreement with the test results of Glare in the impact incident. Simulation results reveal that CARALL represents the better impact resistance property than Glare due to the high strength and stiffness carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP). The numerical simulations using the proposed damage model successfully predict the impact mechanical behavior of CARALL. In addition, finite element models are developed to investigate the effect of the impact resistant of CARALL panels with different aluminum alloys, namely 1060-O, 2024-T3, 6061-T6 and 7075-T6. It is shown that the impact resistance of CARALL is improved by increasing the yield strength of aluminum alloy.",

The high repetition-rate collection process reveals transient features that cannot be resolved in quasi-static measurements. The experiments made at a repetition rate of about 500 Hz show that the detected FBG spectrum broadens for a short period of time and relaxes quickly to a narrower static state. Furthermore, this relaxation time increases dramatically as the strike count increases. The information gained by such measurements will enhance the ability to characterize and distinguish failure modes and predict the remaining lifetime in composite laminate structures.",

The FML was based on a 2024 aluminum alloy, a self-reinforced polypropylene composite and a polypropylene film acting as an interlayer adhesive. The study focuses on the assessing the possibility of using scale model tests for predicting the full scale low velocity impact response of FMLs based on [Al-n, 0 degrees/90(n)degrees](s) and [Al-n, 0 degrees/90 degrees](ns) configurations. These two systems were used to scale four different sample sizes (n = 1/4; 1/2; 3/4 and full scale). The impact load-displacement traces were normalized and found to collapse onto a single curve, suggesting that the laminates obey a scaling law. Attention also focused on characterizing the resulting damage in these multi-layered systems, where it was shown that the deformation modes and failure mechanisms were similar in all four scaled sizes. Other parameters such as the maximum impact force and the time to maximum load showed little sensitivity to scale size. This evidence suggests that data collected from tests on small FML plates can be used to predict the low velocity impact response of larger, more representative structures.",

          "abstract": "It has still not been shown that current failure theories can be accurate for all loading configurations, boundary conditions, layups, and thicknesses of composite laminates. A comprehensive discussion is neither available in the most recent bibliographical reviews, nor in the most recent assessments of their accuracy. In this review article, new failure theories, recent improvements to existing theories, and the most relevant contributions to the modeling of failure mechanisms of composites with continuous reinforcement fibers are discussed, together with their recent applications. The most recent physically based practical failure criteria, which use standard engineering quantities, have affordable computational costs and do not require empirical parameters to be examined for a variety of situations. Their predictions are compared to those of generalized failure criteria currently implemented into widespread finite element codes. The objective is to offer designers a guidance of the range of validity of current theories. To enlarge the set of tests for a single theory, the sample test set, i.e., layups, constituent materials, loading configurations, and boundary conditions, and the experimental results used to develop a failure criterion are used for different criteria. The finite element analysis is carried out using three-dimensional (3D), mixed elements capable of very accurately predicting the local stresses. The ply level stresses are computed discretizing the layers by a 3D mesh- ing. The fiber and matrix stresses, which can differ significantly from the ply level stresses, are computed using a local 3D discretization of the constituents. The phase- averaged fiber and matrix stresses and the ply level stresses are used for failure compu- tations. It is seen that generalized failure criteria can be as accurate as physically based failure criteria for some cases, while the opposite occurs for other cases. Likewise, a criterion can be the most accurate for a particular case and inaccurate in other cases. None of the failure criteria considered appeared accurate for all of the cases considered. However, a group of physically based criteria is identified that, collectively, provides quite accurate predictions. These criteria could be used as reciprocal checks.

A shock tube apparatus was utilized to impart controlled blast loading on carbon fiber panels having three different radii of curvatures; infinite (Panel A), 305 mm (Panel B), and 112 mm (Panel C). These panels with dimensions of 203 mm × 203 mm × 2. mm were held under clamped boundary conditions during the blast loading. A 3D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique coupled with high speed photography was used to obtain out-of-plane deflection and velocity, as well as in-plane strains on the back face of the panels. There were two types of dominant failure mechanisms observed in all the three panels: fiber breakage and inter-layer delamination. Energy loss analysis was also performed which showed that Panel C had the best energy dissipation property. Macroscopic postmortem analysis and DIC results showed that Panel C can mitigate higher intensity blast waves without initiation of catastrophic damage in the panel. Panel B could sustain the least blast intensity and exhibited catastrophic failure. Panel A exhibited intermediate blast mitigation capacity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The hybrid titanium composite laminate (HTCL) incorporates the mechanical advantages of existing hybrid composite laminates such as ARALL and GLARE while extending their applications to elevated temperatures. Titanium layers are bonded by prepreg layers of high-temperature resin reinforced with carbon fibers. The constituent materials used in this study are a metastable β titanium alloy (Ti-15-3), a high-temperature polyimide (LARC™-IAX), and an intermediate modulus carbon fiber (IM7). This study includes quasi-static and fatigue testing of HTCL materials at room temperature and 177°C (350°F.) Experimental stress-strain response of HTCL laminates are compared with predicted results by a laminate analysis code called AGLPLY. A stress-based fatigue study was performed to determine the fatigue properties of HTCL laminates. The roles of residual stress in the mechanical behavior and fatigue properties of HTCL are addressed. The development of damage in HTCL specimens during fatigue is shown to include titanium ply cracking, interfacial debonding, and PMC layer failure. The influence of the fatigue properties of titanium layers on the fatigue of HTCL is discussed. The performance of HTCL laminates in fatigue is shown superior to that of the monolithic titanium alloy for room-temperature and elevated-temperature conditions.",

          "abstract": "Fibre-optic Bragg gratings have been extensively used as longitudinal strain sensors in a large number of applications, fulfilling the same tasks as conventional resistive strain gages. Comparative results obtained in composite laminates with both types of sensors show an excellent correlation in those cases where the strain distributions are smooth. Optical sensors offer additional advantages: unnecessary recalibration, multiplexing capability, small size, embedding ability, etc. An experimentally observed phenomenon is that the single peak of the spectrum of a fibre Bragg grating, written on a standard low-birefringence optical fibre, splits into two peaks when a transverse stress field is applied, owing to the promotion of a strain-induced birefringence. At first sight, this would be an undesirable effect that should be avoided by cladding the sensor. The knowledge of the optical behaviour of fibre Bragg gratings subjected to transverse loads affords additional information about the residual stress field created during the manufacturing process, and on the stress relaxation when machining the part. This paper demonstrates theoretically and experimentally how fibre Bragg gratings can be valuable tools for monitoring composite structures in service, and for obtaining the internal stress and strain states in laminates. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

An extension of the shearlag analysis for laminates containing delaminations initiating from the tips of the transverse cracks was used to conduct a modified Paris law analysis for delamination growth. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, fibrous composite laminate damage is modelled at the elementary-ply scale. Damage mechanics is used to describe the matrix microcracking and fibre/matrix debonding. Damage variables are defined and associated with the material stiffness reduction. In order to take anelastic strains induced by damage into account, a plasticity model is built up. The behaviour differences between tension and compression in the fiber direction are treated. The model leads to a laminate failure criterion. The model-identification procedure is precisely detailed. It consists in performing three tension tests and one compression test on a laminate whose reinforcement directions are conveniently chosen. Some examples are developed in order to show the ability of such a model to describe ply behaviour effects on the mechanical and rupture behaviour of laminates.",

On the edge of laminates, out-of-plane stresses arise, even up to material&#039;s failure. Layer thickness is also known as well to influence delamination onset stress. Making use of a conventional model (that is to say assuming plies homogeneity, elastic linear behaviour, plane interlaminar surface and interface&#039;s infinite stiffness) and of a local stress tensor correction near the edge, allows, thanks to an asymptotic method, an efficient calculation of the full stress tensor. A stress criterion has then been studied. Criterion parameters assessment, from test results, has been focused on, based on conjugate gradient method and experimental thickness effect. Edge Delamination Tests have been performed on several specimens of various layups. Interlaminar shear, tension, as well as shear and tension combination have been investigated. Acoustic emission was used to detect delamination onset. As expected, these tests have exhibited layer thickness influence on onset stress. Shear parameter assessment shows good agreement between theory and experimental results. A single set of parameters is necessary to predict delamination for different layups. But experimental testing for both tensile and mixed mode has shown that failure may not be interlaminar, as expected, but intralaminar. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Damage resistance and damage tolerance to impact events is the most demanding criteria in sizing several aeronautical composites. Tailoring the laminate ply sequence represents an effort towards improving those properties. In this work, the effect of the mismatch angle between the adjacent plies on the damage resistance and damage tolerance of CFRP composites was investigated. Three configurations were considered: a standard configuration (mismatch angle of 45°), a dispersed laminate with small mismatch angles (between 10° and 30°) and another with larger mismatch angles (55-80°). Compared to the other studies in the literature, the main difference is to assess the damage resistance and the damage tolerance for specimens with the same bending stiffness characteristics and the same number of interfaces. It is worth remarking that without using the dispersed laminates, it is impossible to design laminates with the same bending stiffness. The results showed that the dispersed configuration with small mismatch angles had a superior response compared to the other configurations, with respect to the indentation, the dissipated energy and the residual compressive strength (up to 30% increment). These improvements can be justified by the possible effects of the mismatch angle on the damage initiation and/or the damage propagation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The influence of fiber orientation on the failure was studied and discussed. Design/methodology/approach - The subject of examination was AlC. The fiber-metal laminates (FMLs) were manufactured by stacking alternating layers of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy (0.3 mm per sheets) and carbon/epoxy composites made of unidirectional prepreg tape HexPly system (Hexcel, USA) in [0], [+/- 45] and [0/90]S configuration. The fractographic analysis was carried out after static tensile test on the damage area of the specimens. The mechanical tests have been performed in accordance to ASTM D3039. The microstructural and fractographic analysis of FMLs were studied using optical (Nikon SMZ1500, Japan) and scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Ultra Plus, Germany). Findings - FMLs based on aluminum and carbon/epoxy composite are characterized by high tensile properties depending on their individual components and the orientation of the reinforcing fibers, failure of hybrid laminates indicates the complexity process of degradation of these materials. The nature of damage in FML layers is similar to that typical in polymer composites with interlaminar delaminations, transverse cracks of the composite layers, degradation of fiber/matrix interface, damage process in FMLs is also associated mainly with interface between metal and fiber reinforced composite. The mixed damage - cohesive and adhesive - was observed. Originality/value - One of the most important aspect in the designing and manufacturing process in the service life of composite structures is damage mechanisms. The damage processes in composite materials, particularly in FMLs, are more complex in comparison to metal materials and fiber reinforced polymers.",

          "abstract": "Overall damage and failure in advanced composites under cyclic loading are described based on the damage development within loading cycles. The development of scattered damage in a composite over the cyclic load range and during loading and unloading was studied by acoustic emission in Part 1 of this work. In this paper, a novel general model of damage evolution and failure of laminates under cyclic loading is developed based on a stochastic mesomechanics approach. The model combines a lamination theory and a theory of stochastic processes. The randomness of the elastic and strength properties of the composite plies, the laminate microstructural parameters, and the loading are taken into account. A theory of excursions of stochastic processes beyond bounds and a mesovolume concept are utilized to evaluate the ply-level damage functions. The capablities of the approach are illustrated on an example of damage and failure analysis of a laminate under low-cycle tensile loading. The new cycle-based model is found capable of predicting the experimentally observed stages in the overall fatigue damage process, i.e. the initial damage, the gradual damage development, and the final failure. The relative durations of these stages are found to be dependent on the fatigue loading parameters. The predicted damage development over the range of fatigue loading also correlates with the experimental observations. These predictions are intrinsic to the developed stochastic-process-based approach and do not require explicit experimental information on the fatigue damage behavior or stiffness degradation. These results shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of fatigue damage development in advanced composites. The new model treats fatigue of composites as a legitimate load- and time-dependent damage accumulation process within loading cycles. It is expected to be useful for fundamental studies of the effects of variable amplitude, frequency, and cycle shape on the fatigue behavior of advanced composite materials. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "The objective of this study was to introduce a class of collagen-fiber reinforced bio-composite laminates as biomimetic of soft tissues. These novel all-natural bio-composite laminates include long collagen fibers from soft coral embedded in an alginate hydrogel matrix. Controlling the fiber orientation and volume fraction enabled the fabrication of laminates with wide range of mechanical behaviors. Four material systems were investigated in the current study having different fiber orientations: longitudinal (0??), transverse (90??), cross-plied (0/90??) and angle-plied (??30??). The range of Fiber volume fractions (FVFs) for the laminated membranes is between 0.21 and 0.31. The laminates were subjected to uniaxial loading, yielding hyperelastic stress-strain behavior.A hyperelastic finite element (FE) model was constructed for the heterogeneous laminate, based on the fiber and matrix hyperelastic material behavior and their FVF, in order to predict the overall bio-composite mechanical behavior. The predictions of the FE model were verified from the tested laminated systems. The FE model consisted of beam elements representing the collagen fibers embedded in the solid matrix (alginate). Good predictions were demonstrated by the proposed FE model compared with the tested bio-composites for all orientations up to 10% strain. The overall hyperelastic stress-strain behavior was in a similar range to known native soft tissues. In addition, the model allowed for examining the mechanical behavior of laminates with other FVFs. The new bio-composite material can be used for future soft tissue mimicry and repair.",

Both models are compared in terms of their numerical performance and qualitative predictions under different loading conditions. Continuum damage mechanics is used to describe the softening behavior of soft tissues under large deformation, making use of the concept of internal variables which provides a very general description of materials involving irreversible effects. In the stochastic model, statistical aspects related to the distribution of fiber length lead to the strain-driven damage model for the fibrous part. Simulations of a uniaxial test, a hollowed plate under biaxial displacement control, and a 3D simulation of a coronary artery undergoing balloon angioplasty are used to compare the performance of both models. Numerical simulations indicate that both models provide similar predictions of damage. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Composite samples were prepared by mixing the fibers and resin in a mixing chamber for 5 min. The composite sheets were prepared by pressing fiber-resin material in a steel mold at 120°C for 30 min at 10 MPa pressure. The test samples were cut from the composite sheets. At least five specimens were tested and mean value was taken for each composite according to ASTM standards. The reinforcing effects of kenaf and fiberfrax fibers were evaluated at various fiber loadings, that is, 19, 28, 36, 43, 52, and 62 vol. %. The hybrid effect of kenaf and fiberfrax fiber on the tensile, flexural, impact strengths, and hardness was also investigated for various ratios of kenaf/fiberfrax fiber loadings ranging between 1 : 0 and 0 : 1. Total fiber loading of the hybrid composites was 43 vol.%. The tensile, flexural strength, and hardness of the composites increased with increasing fiber loading up to 43 vol.% and decreased above this value for kenaf/PF composites. Impact strength of kenaf/PF composite showed a trend of increase with increasing fiber loading. The tensile and flexural strength of fiberfrax/PF composites increased by incorporation of fiberfrax fiber up to 36 vol. % and decreased beyond this value. However, the maximum impact strength and hardness were obtained for 52 vol. % fiberfrax fiber loading. The tensile, flexural, and impact strength values of fiberfrax/PF composites were found to be lower compared to kenaf/PF composites. With addition of fiberfrax fiber, the tensile, flexural, and impact strengths of the kenaf/fiberfrax hybrid PF composites decreased linearly and the hardness of the composite increased. The maximum hardness value was obtained for 0.25 : 0.75 kenaf/fiberfrax ratio.",

The specimens were exposed to different humidity levels and temperatures for varying periods of time prior to testing. The preexposed specimens were tested under room conditions, and fracture energies during initiation and propagation were estimated. Acoustic emission was used to detect crack initiation. It was indicated that moisture has a slightly beneficial influence on fracture toughness or critical strain energy release rate during Mode I delamination but a slightly deleterious effect on Mode II delamination and Mode I transverse cracking. The failed specimens were examined by scanning electron miscroscope (SEM) and topographical differences due to fracture modes were identified. The effect of moisture on fracture topography could not be distinguished. ?? 1985.",

The model is an integration of three major components: stress analysis, failure analysis, and material property degradation rules. A three-dimensional, nonlinear, finite element technique is developed for the stress analysis. By using a large number of elements near the edge of the stress concentration and at layer interfaces, the edge effect has been accounted for. Each element is considered to be an orthotropic material under multiaxial state of stress. Using the three-dimensional state of stress within each element, different failure modes of a unidirectional ply under multiaxial states of stress an detected by a set of fatigue failure criteria. An analytical technique, called the generalized residual material property degradation technique, is established to degrade the material properties of elements. This analytical technique is not restricted to the application of failure criteria to limited applied stress ratios. Based on the model, a computer code is developed that simulates cycle-by-cycle behaviour of composite laminates under fatigue lending.",

This necessitated the development of a technique for the prediction of high strain rate material property data. The resulting data were used in a finite element analysis (FEA) to simulate impact behaviour of glass fibre reinforced composites. High strain rate properties obtained by extrapolating results of experiments conducted at low to intermediate strain rates were used in the FEA of a simple three-point bend beam impact. Three point bend impact tests were performed on the laminates, and comparisons were made of the results predicted from this analysis and actual impact test data. The results show that the finite element model created may be used to predict the behaviour of woven glass laminates.

Distortion and broadening of the width of the FBG spectra were observed in several of the specimens. As a result of a strong non-uniformity of the strain field caused by local asymmetric loading of the sensor, pronounced splitting of the spectra into multiple peaks was noted for FBG sensors embedded in angle-ply configurations. In contrast, the FBG spectra for the unidirectional specimens exhibited a single well-defined peak. Tensile tests carried out on these specimens showed excellent linearity within the test regime. However, for specimens exhibiting a multi-peak spectrum, it was observed that these specimens showed a tendency to produce strain anomalies during the loading event. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this work, the authors present the latest research with this method, and analyse fatigue damage phenomena in GFRC laminates under tensile fatigue load employing notched and notch-free specimens. Damage analysis based on optical DIC technique has been performed to detect the damaged areas on the specimen surface and to follow failure mechanisms during lifetime; the damage evolution in composites was performed monitoring two parameters: the local hysteresis area of stress strain cycles, the local stiffness variation. These parameters are evaluated on a grid by means of DIC strain measurements during the entire fatigue life showing encouraging results. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

The proposed formulation captures the damaging behavior of plates with initial defects and stress raisers such as holes, including damage initiation, evolution, and ultimate fracture of the specimen. It also helps explain the reduction of stress concentration factor when matrix and fiber damage develop. The state variables are the crack density and the fiber failure damage. The formulation is implemented as a material model in Abaqus applicable to laminated composite plates and shells. Material defects are simulated by inserting an initial crack density in a small region of the specimen. Stress raisers are simulated by an open hole. The predictions are shown to be insensitive to mesh density. Further, damage localizes near stress raiser and material defects, thus numerically demonstrating the objectivity of the proposed model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with experimental data are presented.",

Two kinds of quasi-isotropic (45°/0°/-45°/90°)2s laminates were used in order to investigate the effects of resin toughness and fiber strength. After impact at various energy levels, the thermal deply technique was applied to investigate the three-dimensional distribution of damage such as fiber breakage and delamination. In each kind of laminate, the absorbed impact energy was found to be a linear function of both the main crack area with fiber breakage and the total delamination area. Thus, the absorbed energies per unit area due to fiber breakage, and due to delamination could be determined independently. The differences between two kinds of laminates suggested that the increase in interlaminar fracture toughness increases the energy absorbing capability due to delamination, while it decreases the capability due to fiber breakage.",

In this study, a representative unit cell model of a triaxial braided composite is developed based on the composite fiber volume ratio, specimen thickness and microscopic image analysis. A meso-scale finite element (FE) mesh is generated based on the detailed unit cell dimensions and fiber bundle geometry parameters. The fiber bundles are modeled as unidirectional fiber reinforced composites. A micromechanical finite element model was developed to predict the elastic and strength material properties of each unidirectional composite by imposing correct boundary conditions that can simulate the actual deformation within the braided composite. These details are then applied in the meso-mechanical finite element model for a 0??/+60??/-60?? triaxially braided T700s/E862 carbon/epoxy composite. Model correlations are conducted by comparing numerical predicted and experimental measured axial tension and transverse tension response of a straight-sided, single-layer (one ply thick) coupon. By applying a periodic boundary condition in the loading direction, the meso model captures the local damage initiation and global failure behavior, as well as the periodic free-edge warping effect. The failure mechanisms are studied using the field damage initiation contours and local stress history. The influence of free-edge effect on the failure behaviors is investigated. The numerical study results reveal that this meso model is capable of predicting free-edge effect and allows identification of its impact on the composite response. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These are contrasted with composite damage development at low strain rates and with the dynamic failure of monolithic ceramics. It is possible to derive significant strain-rate strengthening benefits if a major fraction of the fiber reinforcement is aligned with the load axis. This effect considerably exceeds the inertial microfracture strengthening observed in monolithic ceramics and nonaligned composites. Its basis is shown to be the transspecimen propagation time period for heterogeneously-nucleated, high-strain kink bands. For high-strain-rate tensile loading conditions, it is found that behavior is not correctly described by the current matrix fracture/fiber pullout models. This is a consequence of the rapid and extreme frictional heating produced at the fiber-matrix interface by sliding velocities on the order of 100 m/s. At rapid loading rates, the near-interface matrix appears to virtually melt, and the frictional interface shear resistance is reduced to the point that the fibers debond throughout the specimen, and pull out without failing. This suggests that for sufficiently rapid loading, the stress to fail the composite will approach that merely to create the initial matrix crack (i.e., a stress level well below the ultimate strength normally attainable under quasistatic conditions).",

The stresses in the constituents are obtained using a representative volume element (RVE) approach. Finite element analysis is carried out to extract the stresses in the constituents and the overall effective properties of the composite material. To consider the realistic behavior of the matrix of the composite material, a modified Drucker-Prager failure criterion is used. Direct test data on the individual constituents are used in this approach to model the failure of each of the constituents separately using the extracted stresses in the individual constituents. Failure envelope plotted for a unidirectional fiber reinforced composite material using the proposed model clearly shows that the initiation of damage is different in different constituents of the composite material. This is more realistic compared to the popularly used macroscopic criteria such as Tsai-Wu criterion. Propagation of failure in fiber reinforced composite is captured using a simple progressive damage model. It is also found that the hexagonal RVE has more predictive capabilities than the square RVE since the average distance between the fiber may play a major role in the strength prediction of composites.",

They can easily be placed in resin rich interlayers between reinforcing plies prior to laminate production and require no dispersion into the matrix resin. Although there are many expected benefits, the research on composite laminates enhanced with electrospun thermoplastic nanofibres is still very limited and a thorough understanding of the toughening mechanism is still missing. This article provides thorough insights into the micromechanisms that lead to the interlaminar toughening of carbon/epoxy composite laminates interleaved with electrospun polyamide nanofibrous veils. The main mechanism leading to a higher interlaminar fracture toughness, both under Mode I and Mode II loading conditions, was the bridging of (micro)cracks by PA nanofibres. The effectiveness of the nanofibre bridging toughening mechanism is dependent on a good load transfer to the nanofibres. Crack propagation under Mode II loading conditions resulted in much higher improvements than under Mode I loading due to an optimal loading of the nanofibres along their fibre direction in the plane of the nanofibrous veil. In Mode I crack propagation, however, the loading of the nanofibres is less optimal and was shown to be dependent on both the primary reinforcement fabric architecture, as well as on the presence of a carbon fibre bridging zone.",

The cracking behavior is quantified by measuring crack densities as a function of the laminate strain. The difference between the damage progress near the 90?? ply transverse crack tips between the material systems are observed. Damage mechanics analysis is used to predict 90?? ply transverse cracking based on both the energy and stress criteria.

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0degrees/90degrees] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies. Predictions of residual velocity, development of deformation and delamination correlate well with experimental results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The approach combines the strengths of micro-damage mechanics (MDM) and continuum damage mechanics (CDM) in predicting the stiffness degradation due to presence of transverse cracks. The micromechanics is performed on a representative unit cell using a three-dimensional finite element analysis to calculate the crack opening displacement (COD) accounting for the influence of the surrounding plies, the so-called constraint effect. This information is then incorporated in the CDM formulation dealing with laminates containing cracks in different ply orientations through a &#039;constraint parameter&#039;. In CDM, a separate damage mode is defined for each type of crack and the expressions for engineering moduli of the damaged laminate are derived in terms of crack density and the constraint parameter. The COD and stiffness degradation predictions agree well with published experimental data for [0 / ± θ4 / 01 / 2]s laminate configuration. To enable damage analysis of other configurations of [0m / ± θn / 0m / 2]s laminate, a parametric study of the CODs is performed and using the computations a master equation is developed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

They are often investigated separately, and so the interaction between two damage modes has not yet been revealed. In this paper, a simple parallel-spring model is introduced to model the longitudinal stiffness reduction due to matrix cracking and edge delamination together. The energy release rate of edge delamination eliminating the matrix crack effect and the energy release rate of matrix cracking in the presence of edge delamination are then obtained. Experimental materials include carbon- and glass-fibre-reinforced bismaleimide composite laminates under static tension. The growth of matrix cracks and edge delaminations was recorded by means of NDT techniques. Results show that matrix cracks may initiate before or after edge lamination. This depends on the laminate layup, and especially on the thickness of the 90?? plies. Edge delamination may also induce matrix cracking. Matrix cracking has a significant effect on the stiffness reduction in GRP laminates. The present model can predict the stiffness reduction in a laminate containing both matrix cracks and edge delaminations. The mixed-mode delamination fracture toughness obtained from the present model shows up to 50% differences compared with O&#039;Brien&#039;s model for GRP laminates.

After a general\nreview of modeling approaches and experimentally observed behavior\nof laminates, the focus is laid on predicting non-linear laminate\nbehavior by models based on continuum damage mechanics.

Finally, a ply level damage model developed by the\nauthors is presented. The model is based on brittle failure mechanisms\npostulated by Puck and is able to capture several characteristics\nof the damage behavior of laminates. Furthermore, this brittle damage\nmodel is extended to include plastic shear deformations.

The methodology, based on an ultrasonic test apparatus in the form of reflection, allows us to determine the position along the thickness and extension of delaminations on several CFRP, GFRP and KFRP laminates subjected to low-velocity impact test. The experiments have been performed in two distinct phases. During the first phase typical aerospace materials such as thermoset and thermoplastic CFRP thin laminates and sandwich were inspected, in order to validate the ultrasonic NDI system and the original test methodology. Then, in the second phase, tests have been performed on glass fiber and polyester resin systems, where the fiber was in the form of woven fabric or woven roving, and Kevlar and polyester resin system, where the Kevlar is in the form of woven fabric. All the specimens are made by RTM technology and the thickness are comprised between 5 and 6 mm. Moreover, the NDI analysis was performed using two different probes (5 and 15 MHz), in order to evaluate the importance of the probe frequency for the reliable evaluation of delaminations on composite materials. The results show the NDI system capabilities in terms of damage detection, location and evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Fiber-metal laminates are a family of hybrid materials, consisting of alternating layers of thin metal sheets and fiber reinforced epoxy prepregs. The FML offer low density, excellent fatigue, impact, flame, corrosion resistance. In contrast to aluminum alloys, the presence of notches in FML causes significant strength reductions. Since many holes or blunt notches occur in an airframe such as windows, doors and riveted holes, the blunt strength is an important design parameter in engineering application. This paper investigates the notch behavior of glass fiber reinforced metal laminates (GLARE) with a circular hole. Mechanical tests were performed to determine the laminate tensile properties and notched strength of laminates. The influence of specimen dimension and notch size on the notch sensitivity of GLARE laminates was studied. A modified point stress criterion was introduced to evaluate the notched strength of GLARE laminates. An excellent agreement between experimental results and model prediction was obtained. The damage mechanism of blunt notched GLARE laminates was also investigated.",

          "abstract": "The electrical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotube (CNT) doped epoxy resin and composites based on this matrix were studied. The investigation was carried out on neat nanocomposites and on structural composites i.e., when the nanocomposite is used as matrix in composite materials reinforced with long continuous fibers. Tensile tests showed that CNT doped epoxy exhibited clear piezoresistive behavior. It was, however, also shown that geometrical changes of the specimen also contribute significantly to resistance changes during tensile loading. Particular effort was made to establish the relations between transverse cracking in glass fiber cross-ply laminates with nanotube doped matrix and changes of electrical resistance. It was shown that changes of electrical resistance during tensile loading of composites containing CNT doped matrix gives highly relevant information about the damage state of the material. In an unloaded state the resistance change is proportional to the relative change of stiffness. This work demonstrates that there are three different mechanisms, which contribute to changes of electrical resistance of a composite specimen subjected to tensile strain. These three mechanisms are: (a) geometrical changes of the specimen (b) piezoresistive material response, and (c) accumulation of micro-damage.",

The transverse strain in the plate theory is used to account for the slippage between adjacent plies. This interply slip is characterized by a rate dependent constitutive model that is adopted from an experimentally determined relation between the interply shear stress and interply slip velocity. A laminate under cylindrical bending assumptions is used to demonstrate the methodology and to examine the contributions of temperature and loading rate to the amount of compressive stress in the surface ply located on the inner radius of curvature. An experiment which allows measurement of the load histories required to form a thermoplastic composite laminate by the matched die molding process is described. Load histories for two laminates and two forming rates at a typical melt-phase forming temperature are presented along with the histories given by the forming model. Using a hydraulic hot press and two-stage matched die mold, the upper limit on forming rate at a specific forming temperature is demonstrated. Forming above this rate results in wrinkling of the plies on the inner radius of curvature. Copyright ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.",

The predicted load-displacement curves and failure loads of a single-lap single-bolt joint were compared with experimental data for different joint geometries and laminate stacking sequences. The stiffness of the joint was predicted with satisfactory accuracy for all configurations. The predicted failure load was significantly influenced by the combination of failure criteria and degradation rules used.

Recent advances in health monitoring technologies have resulted in the development of micro-dimensional devices that can be embedded into composite laminates. Notwithstanding their small size, such inclusions may affect the response of the composite. Damage induced by the peak values of stress concentration around the embedded inclusion is, in fact, one of the main concerns in smart structures technology. To address this specific issue, unidirectional S2 glass fiber/epoxy laminated composites are fabricated with embedded small implants that mimic potential sensors and microprocessors. Quasi-static tensile tests are then performed on those samples while monitoring them by the acoustic emission (AE) technique. Additionally, the microstructure of the material with and without implants is explored. The AE results show that early low-medium amplitude events are detected at the implant location and the micrographic inspections reveal that micro-cracks initiate at the device-composite matrix interface and grow around the implant causing the debond of the external component from the surrounding resin system. © The Author(s), 2009.",

It is essential to simulate the initial and subsequent evolution process of this kind of damage phenomenon accurately in order to explore the mechanical properties of composite laminates. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the general methodologies on the damage constitutive modeling by continuum damage mechanics (CDM), the various failure criteria, the damage evolution law simulating the stiffness degradation, and the finite element implementation of progressive failure analysis in terms of the mechanical response for the variable-stiffness composite laminates arising from the continuous failure. The damage constitutive modeling is discussed by describing the evolvement of damage tensors and conjugate forces in the CDM theory. The failure criteria which interpret the failure modes and their interaction are compared and some advanced methods such as the cohesive theory which are used to predict the damage evolution properties of composites are also discussed. In addition, the solution algorithm using finite element analysis which implements progressive failure analysis is summarized and several applicable methods which deal with the numerical convergence problem due to singular finite element stiffness matrices are also compared in order to explore the whole failure process and ultimate load-bearing ability of composite laminates. Finally, the multiscale progressive failure analysis as a popular topic which associates the macroscopic with microscopic damage and failure mechanisms is discussed and the extended finite element method as a new finite element technique is expected to accelerate its practical application to the progressive failure analysis of composite laminates.",

The second is a two-component Bisphenol resin with amine-based slow curing agent. The average tensile strength ranged between 127.4 and 152.3 MPa for long unidirectional fibers and 8.4 to 62.6 MPa for short and medium length fibers respectively (depending on process and resin type). The Bisphenol laminates have better mechanical properties. These laminates have consistently 25 to 50% higher tensile strength than Phenolic laminates. The bending strength ranged between 120.6 and 342.3 MPa (at 500 mm/min loading speed) depending on fiber length. Short fiber Bisphenol laminates have excellent fatigue life characteristics (over 466,000 and 653,000 cycles at 70% and 60% of maximum stress loads respectively). The process parameters and resin types have significant effects on the laminate properties. The water absorption of the laminates ranged between 2.3 to 5.8% for the Phenolic laminates (depending on the test method and manufacturing process used). The water absorption of Bisphenol laminates ranged between 10 and 40%. The produced laminates were very stable to handle all required machining processes as construction panels.

          "abstract": "In order to develop more rational design and damage tolerance approaches, there is a need for more accurate, realistic, and practical modeling of damage progression in composite structures at the component level, and not just at the laboratory specimen level. This presents a considerable challenge because experimental and analytical results at the specimen level do not always translate to observations of damage at the component or structural levels. In this article, a simple but novel finite element-based method for modeling progressive damage in fiber-reinforced composites is proposed. The element-failure method (EFM) is based on the idea that the nodal forces of an element of a damaged composite material can be modified to reflect the general state of damage and loading. The EFM, when employed with suitable micromechanics-based failure criteria, may be a practical method for mapping damage initiation and propagation in composite structures. This concept is especially useful because the nature of damage in composite laminates is in general complex and diffused, characterized by multiple matrix cracks, fiber pullout, fiber breakage, and delaminations. It is therefore not practical or even possible to identify and model the multitude of cracks in the fashion of traditional fracture mechanics. Currently, progressive damage in composites is most commonly modeled using material property degradation methods (MPDM). Unfortunately, MPDM often employs rather arbitrary and restrictive degradation schemes that, in some cases may result in computational problems. In contrast, computational convergence and stability is always assured in EFM because the stiffness matrix is never altered. Furthermore, no contact algorithm to prevent nonphysical solutions involving interpenetration of delamination and crack surfaces is necessary, because the failed elements are not removed from the model. It is shown in this article that the EFM is a more general method than the MPDM. A comparison study of damage progression and delamination in a composite laminate subjected to three-point bend using a recently proposed failure criterion called the strain invariant failure theory (SIFT) is presented. The results show that the EFM is able to predict the damage pattern more accurately than the MPDM.",

In this study, a statistical analysis was used to study the progressive transverse cracking in a typical high temperature composite. The mechanical properties of this unidirectional laminates were first characterized both at room and high temperatures. Damage mechanisms of transverse cracking in cross-ply laminates were studied by X-ray radiography at room temperature and in-test photography technique at high temperature. Since the tensile strength of unidirectional laminate along transverse direction was found to follow Weibull distribution, Monte Carlo simulation technique based on experimentally obtained parameters was applied to predict transverse cracking at different temperatures. Experiments and simulation showed that they agree well both at room temperature and 149 ??C (stress free temperature) in terms of applied stress versus crack density. The probability density function (PDF) of transverse crack spacing considering statistical strength distribution was also developed, and good agreements with simulation and experimental results are reached. Finally, a generalized master curve that predicts the normalized applied stress versus normalized crack density for various lay-ups and various temperatures was established. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

By carrying out the constant amplitude sine-wave fatigue tests at fatigue load ratios (R) of R = 0 and R= -1, the importance of shear reversal was evaluated. The effect of improved matrix toughness on the Mode II properties was determined by testing four different graphite fiber composite systems having widely different Mode I fracture energies. The results indicated that the benefits of improved matrix toughness on the composite properties were less under Mode II loading than under Mode I and were reduced further still, or eliminated entirely, under Mode II fatigue conditions. It was found also that full shear reversal had an accelerating effect on the Mode II fatigue crack growth rates, especially at low values of ∆GII . These findings are discussed in terms of the failure mechanisms taking place. The significance of the results to damage tolerance and long-term durability design considerations are also addressed.",

A large number of experiments were performed to examine the effect of design and process parameters on spring-in and warpage of composite laminates with a symmetrical lay-up. The parameters studied include part angle, thickness, lay-up, flange length, tool material, tool surface, and cure cycle. This paper shows that both design and process parameters can have a significant effect on spring-in and warpage and that there are interactive effects between them. The paper also shows that spring-in of angled laminates is sensitive to the measurement technique as the measured spring-in often is compounded by warpage of flat laminate sections. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "The Zanchor process is a novel through-thickness reinforcement technique in which in-plane yarns are entangled with each other using special needles. Mode I interlaminar fatigue crack growth behavior was investigated in carbon fiber (CF)/epoxy cross-ply laminates with Zanchor reinforcement. The laminates were molded with a Zanchor-reinforced CF dry fabric through resin film infusion (RFI). Delamination fatigue tests were carried out using double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. The threshold values of the maximum energy release rates, GImaxth, under R = 0.1 were 70 J/m2 for Zanchor 0 (base laminate without Zanchor reinforcement) and 240 J/m2 for Zancor 2 (the density of Zanchor reinforcement is twice as high as the unit density), respectively; those under R = 0.5 were 80 J/m2 for Zanchor 0 and 400 J/m2 for Zancor 2, respectively. Thus, the threshold values for Zanchor 2 were about 3.4-5 times higher than those without Zanchor reinforcement. This increase induced by Zanchor reinforcement is almost the same or higher than that obtained under static loading (3.5 times). It is common that the increase in the fracture toughness, GIc, induced by replacing the matrix resin with a tougher system only partially contributes to the increase in the fatigue threshold, GImaxth. On the other hand, the increase in GIc induced by Zanchor reinforcement was fully translated to the increase in GImaxth. This is why Zanchor 2 gives one of the highest fatigue threshold values among existing toughened composite material systems. The difference between the reinforcing effects under static and fatigue loadings was discussed in conjunction with the microscopic fracture mechanism. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A micromechanical model based on a probabilistic approach is implemented in the finite element code CASTEM 2000 to develop numerical simulations that efficiently predict the overall damaged behaviour of random oriented fibre composites. The proposed damage constitutive model is based upon the generalised Mori and Tanaka scheme and Eshelby&#039;s equivalence theory. Damage mechanisms occurring at each composite constituent (fibres, matrix and interface) are associated to Weibull probabilistic functions to model their onset and progressive growth at the microscopic scale level. It is obvious that the damaged behaviour of the composite material depends widely on the microscopic material parameters (fibre length, fibre volume fraction, fibre orientation,...). On one hand, the micromechanical model uses homogenisation techniques which enabled us to link these microscopic parameters to the material behaviour and to evaluate explicitly their influences. On the other hand, the implementation of the derived behaviour law into a finite element code enabled us to reflect on the effect of these microscopic parameters on the overall response of a simple composite structure presenting heterogeneous stress fields. In fact, the damage evolution in each constituent (local scale) and the related stiffness reduction are estimated at any material point (integration point) or node of the considered structure subject to a specific loading. Numerical simulations of a composite plate with a hole under in-plane tension were performed to validate the implementation of the behaviour law. Numerical results have been compared to experimental curves and damage evolutions monitored by acoustic emission techniques. Simulations agree well with experimental results in terms of damage onset and growth. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Bridging by intact fibers is well recognized as an important toughening mechanism that accompanies delamination propagation in fibrous laminates. However, direct measurement of the bridging tractions is a challenging task. In this work, an iterative methodology based on internal strain measurements and parametric finite element modeling is employed to identify the contribution of fiber bridging to delamination resistance of unidirectional carbon fiber/epoxy laminates. Double cantilever beam specimens with integrated arrays of wavelength-multiplexed fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) are subjected to mode I loading. Non-uniform strain distribution in the vicinity of the interlaminar crack plane is locally monitored by means of the several embedded FBG sensors of 1 mm gauge length. Employing an inverse identification procedure, the measured strain data are used to determine the bridging tractions associated with delimitation growth. It is shown that such an iterative procedure can be effectively applied for characterization of the energy release rate due to the fiber bridging in specimens of different thicknesses. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2014.",

The loading confinement ratio R was varied from 0.24 to nearly 1.0 to measure the sensitivity of sample failure mechanisms and stress-strain behavior to different stress states. Failure modes with an increasing loading confinement ratio for both fiber orientations transitioned from the uniaxial failure mode of in-plane shearing to out-of-plane shearing and massive delamination. The shear failures were on one or more planes that traversed the entire sample thickness and thus encompassed alternate plies in which fibers were aligned and misaligned with respect to the shear plane. The local failure was found to be triggered either by the matrix shear in fiber-aligned plies or fiber-shear in the fiber-misaligned plies. A standard classical laminate theory in combination with the standard rule of mixture theory for composites was used to calculate the maximum matrix and fiber shear stresses. The failure data conformed nicely with a Mohr-Coulomb-type shear failure law. Most interestingly, both types of failures correlated rather remarkably to a single shear failure law when the stresses were smeared and expressed on the scale of the laminae. This latter failure law should have widespread use because of its simplicity. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Fatigue is attributed to underlying fatigue crack growth of pre-existing fiber flaws, and the fiber fatigue model is validated and calibrated by comparison to experimental data on fatigue of dry bundles of T700S carbon fibers. Predictions of fiber damage and resistance change in a carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites (CFRP) during cyclic loading are then made, analytical and numerical models in quantitative agreement over most of the life. The models predict a direct correlation between resistance and stiffness changes, and quantitatively agree with the experimental results for T300/Hexcel 914 system. The effects of single-cycle overloads on the electrical resistance during otherwise fixed-amplitude cyclic loading are studied, showing an influence on life dependent upon both overload amplitude and cycle number. The resistance change is also shown to increase substantially prior to any noticeable change in remaining strength, and to accelerate as the remaining strength decreases. Collectively, the results suggest that electrical resistance can provide insight into the underlying damage evolution and fatigue life of composite systems and serve as the basis for system prognosis or health monitoring. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The traditional imperfections include the geometric shell-wall mid-surface imperfections that are commonly discussed in the literature on thin shell buckling. The nontraditional imperfections include shell-wall thickness variations, local shell-wall ply-gaps associated with the fabrication process, shell-end geometric imperfections, nonuniform applied end loads, and variations in the boundary conditions including the effects of elastic boundary conditions. The cylinder parameter uncertainties considered include uncertainties in geometric imperfection measurements, lamina fiber volume fraction, fiber and matrix properties, boundary conditions, and applied end load distribution. Results that include the effects of these traditional and nontraditional imperfections and uncertainties on the nonlinear response characteristics, buckling loads and failure of the shells are presented. The analysis procedure includes a nonlinear static analysis that predicts the stable response characteristics of the shells, and a nonlinear transient analysis that predicts the unstable response characteristics.

          "abstract": "The fatigue response of an eight-ply, unidirectional, titanium-based metal-matrix composite (MMC) (SCS-6/Ti-15-3) was investigated at elevated temperature (427 °C) using a hybrid strain-controlled loading mode. This hybrid control mode did not allow the thin MMC specimen to experience any compressive stress and, thus, prevented buckling. All fatigue testing was conducted at a constant strain rate of 0.2% s-1. Damage mechanisms were systematically identified for the cases when loading was parallel or perpendicular to the fiber direction. When the fibers were parallel to the loading direction, the dominant damage mechanism was either fiber fracture or matrix cracking. Matrix creep occurred at all levels of strain, and matrix plasticity was observed when the strain level was greater than 0.55%. When loading was perpendicular to the fiber direction, the fiber-matrix interfacial damage was the dominant damage mechanism. The severity of this damage varied depending upon the maximum strain level. Matrix cracks also had a critical effect on the fatigue response when the maximum strain level was greater than 0.35%. Plastic deformation in the matrix material occurred for strain levels greater than 0.23%, and matrix creep was a key factor at all strain levels. Fatigue-life diagrams along with dominant deformation and damage mechanisms were established for both cases and are compared with previous studies. © 1995.",

Based on the solution, explicit expressions of the average energy release rate for self-similar delamination growth are also given for the applied load as a function of the dimensions of the plate and the circular damage.

The conventional techniques for strengthening of substandard bridges are costly, time consuming, and labor intensive. Many new techniques have used the lightweight, high strength, and the corrosion resistance of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) laminates for repair and retrofit applications. The load-carrying capacity of a steel-concrete composite girder can be improved significantly by epoxy bonding carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) laminates to its tension flange. This paper presents the results of a study on the behavior of steel-concrete composite girders strengthened with CFRP sheets under static loading. A total of three large-scale composite girders made of W355 X 13.6 A36 steel beam and 75-mm thick by 910-mm wide concrete slab were prepared and tested. The thickness of the CFRP sheet was constant and a different number of layers of 1, 3, and 5 were used in the specimens. The test results, showed that epoxy-bonded CFRP sheet increased the ultimate load-carrying capacity of steel-concrete composite girders and the behavior can be conservatively predicted by traditional methods.",

A crater and splits were observed on the impacted surface, while multiple splits with fiber breaks extended on the back surface. The cross-section beneath the impact point included catastrophic ply failure with extensive fiber breaks. Impacted specimens also exhibited a particular delamination pattern consisting of pairs of symmetric fan-shaped delaminations emanating from to the impact point and elongated delamination along the cracks in the bottom ply. These damage patterns were common to all of the stacking sequences.

Mechanical characterisation tests were conducted on bulk composite specimens to determine various properties such as interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and transverse tension strength which clearly illustrate the difference in fibre/matrix interfacial adhesion. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the difference in fracture surfaces, the untreated fibre composites showing interfacial failure while the treated fibre composites showed matrix failure. No clear differences were found for the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and Young&#039;s modulus of the FRMLs despite the differences in the bulk composite properties. A reduction of 7.5% in the apparent value of the ILSS was identified for the untreated fibre laminates by both three-point and five-point bend tests. Residual strength and blunt notch tests showed remarkable increases in strength for the untreated fibre specimens over the treated ones. Increases of up to 20% and 14% were found for specimens with a circular hole and saw cut, respectively. The increase in strength is attributed to the promotion of fibre/matrix splitting and large delamination zones in the untreated fibre specimens owing to the weak fibre/matrix interface.

With continuous and widespread use of these composites in several advanced technology, the frequency of failures is likely to increase. Therefore, to establish the reasons for failures, the fracture modes should be understood thoroughly and unambiguously. In this paper, CFRP composite have been tested in tension, compression and flexural loadings; and microscopic study with the aid of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) has been performed on failed (fractured) composite surfaces to identify the principle features of failure. Efforts have been made in correlating the fracture surface characteristics to the failure mode.

The impregnated layers were heated under pressure for the fibre surfaces to partially dissolve in the IL and to achieve compaction of the single laminae to form a composite. A matrix phase is formed in situ by the regeneration of dissolved fraction of the fibre via solvent exchange. Both textiles could be processed into thick (&gt;1 mm) cellulose laminates.

Pullout, sliding and immediate fracture modes are observed; the fracture mechanisms depend on the CNT-epoxy interface strength and fiber strength, and other microstructures such as the interface between CNT laminates. Compared to the functionalized CNT composites, weaker CNT-epoxy interface strength and higher fiber strength lead to a higher probability of sliding fracture and higher tensile strength in the pristine CNT composites at high strain rates. On the contrary, sliding fracture is more pronounced in the functionalized CNT composites under quasistatic loading, a manifestation of a loading-rate effect on fracture modes. Despite their helpful sliding fracture mode and large CNT content, the weak laminate-laminate interfaces play a detrimental role in fracture of the laminated CNT buckypaper/epoxy composites. Regardless of materials, increasing strain rates leads to pronounced rise in tensile strength and fracture toughness.",

Two different computational strategies are developed: (i) a cohesive model (CM) based on the classical continuum mechanics and (ii) a continuous damage material model (CDM) coupling failure modes and damage. Another mixed methodology (MM) is proposed using the continuous damage model for delamination initiation and the cohesive model for 3D crack propagation and mesh openings.

In many practical situations, the structures are subjected to loading at very high strain rates. Material and structural response vary significantly under such loading as compared to static loading. A structure that is expected to perform under dynamic loading conditions, if designed with the static properties, might be too conservative. Hence. it is necessary to characterize the advanced composites under high strain rate loading. In the current investigations, the response of carbon/epoxy laminated composites under high strain rate compression loading is considered using a modified split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) setup at three different strain rates of 82, 164 and 817 s-1. The laminates were fabricated using 32 plies of a DA 4518 unidirectional carbon/epoxy prepreg system. Both unidirectional and cross-ply laminates were considered for the study. In the case of cross-ply laminates, the samples were tested in the thickness as well as in the in-plane direction. The unidirectional laminate samples were subjected to loading along 0° and 90° directions. Dynamic stress-strain plot was obtained for each sample and compared with the static compression test result. The results of the study indicate that the dynamic strength (with the exception of through the thickness loading of cross-ply laminates) and stiffness exhibit considerable increase as compared to the static values within the tested range of strain rates. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Water immersion conditioning at 80 ??C for up to 4 months was carried out on GLARE 4A laminates. It was found that although the outer aluminum layers effectively protected the glass/epoxy composite layers from hygrothermal attack, the composite layers absorbed moisture through the edges. Consequently, significant decrease in both, the tensile strength and fatigue life of the GLARE 4A laminates, was observed although no structural defects were apparently identifiable in the microstructures of the conditioned laminates. Detailed experimental investigation was conducted to study the mechanism of mechanical property decay due to hygrothermal aging. It is proposed that the strength of the S2-glass fibers was not fully realized due to the weakening of the fiber/matrix interface and the deterioration of the sizing, which consequently led to the reduction in the tensile strength and fatigue life of the GLARE 4A laminates. The stiffness degradation characteristics of GLARE 4A laminates under cyclic loading were also investigated.",

The damage zone is considered, from the residual strength standpoint, as an equivalent implanted hole, and strength degradation is calculated using a linear elastic fracture mechanics approach previously proposed. The results of experimental tests, carried out at low velocity on AS/3501 (0/{+/-}45) 2s laminates, show a good correlation with theoretical predictions; moreover, data available in the literature seem to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed formula in foreseeing the com pressive strength degradation due to impact. The physical meaning of the parameters appearing in the model, together with the data here presented, suggests a method to obtain the residual strength curve as a func tion of impact energy by a minimum number of experimental tests. This method is ex pected to be valid for rate-insensitive materials such as carbon fiber reinforced laminates.",

Unidirectional laminates loaded parallel to the fibres have compressive strengths that are 70% of the tensile strength and fail by fibre-microbuckling.  During microbuckling, the fibre debonds from the matrix, and the fibres break in bending.  Multidirectional [(+/- 45/0(2))3]s laminates were also tested in compression, and the critical failure mechanism observed was microbuckling of the 0-degrees piles.  The failure strain was almost the same as for the undirectional laminate, which indicated that the +/- 45-degrees piles have no significant influence on the failure strength of the 0-degrees plies.",

This approach utilizes micromechanics and continuum damage mechanics to predict the overall mechanical response of composite laminates with ply cracking in multiple orientations. The material constants needed in the continuum damage mechanic formulation are calculated from stiffness property changes incurred in a reference laminate. For other laminate configurations, the stiffness changes are derived using a relative constraint parameter which is calculated from the constraint on the opening displacement of ply cracks within the given cracked laminate evaluated numerically by a finite element analysis of appropriately constructed representative unit cell. The number density of ply cracks (cracks per unit length normal to the crack planes) under quasi-static loading is calculated by an energy-based approach. Finally, the stress-strain response of a laminate is determined by combining stiffness property changes and evolution of crack number density.",

Drop-weight impact damage was induced to a composite specimen with impact energy of 6.7 J/mm in accordance with ASTM D7136. Postimpact fatigue tests were conducted using a test fixture defined in ASTM D7137 under compression-compression loading (R = 10) at room temperature. The maximum compressive stress (Smin) was 200, 210, 220, 230, and 240 MPa, and the total number of specimens was 31. The compression-after-impact strength and fatigue lifetime show considerable scattering. This result is apparently derived from the variation in impact damage size. A simple statistical model based on the weakest link theory was proposed for predicting the lifetime of impact-damaged composite laminates. Results show that the experimentally obtained data were confirmed consistently using this model. The ratio between the endurance limit at 106 and 107 cycles and the initial static strength was estimated as 0.74 and 0.68 as B-basis allowable values. © 2013 Japan Society for Composite Materials, Korean Society for Composite Materials and Taylor &amp; Francis.",

Indeed, results from the literature show that laminates which have the same stress state at the core can have completely different states of degradation, even far away from the edges. The paper discusses the influence of the edge effect on damage initiation and propagation for a specific example. A computational micromechanical approach to the degradation of laminated composites was developed recently at LMT-Cachan. This is a hybrid approach in which, depending on the scale, the mechanisms are described using continuous damage mechanics or finite fracture mechanics. Initially developed for static loading, this technique is being extended to fatigue and environmental effects. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the capability of such an approach to take into account major observations during cyclic loading in an oxidizing atmosphere, even when edge effects are significant. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The experimental study of fastener pull-through failure in composite laminates reported in Part 1 of this paper found pull- through failure to be characterised by substantial internal damage similar to that observed for low-velocity impacted composite panels. Damage is manifested in the form of a conically distributed network of matrix cracking and delaminations extending through-the-thickness from the fastener head outer edge, directed away from the fastener hole. Analysis is conducted in this paper to identify the mechanisms responsible for failure. Finite element analysis indicated high shear stresses at the fastener head outer edge to be responsible for the matrix cracking in this region. Tensile in-plane stresses are the cause of ̄exural failures found elsewhere in laminates of reduced bending stiness. Fastener pull-through failure results from the tensile strength of the resin being exceeded. Matrix cracking was found to be the initial mode of failure with cracks aligning themselves perpendicular to the direction of principal stresses. Interply delamination is a secondary mode of failure and represents a propagation of cracking along the path of least resistance. Delaminations are induced due to excessive interlaminar shear and peel strains in the laminate due to through- thickness deformation and matrix cracking respectively. A numerical procedure for the prediction of failure was developed based upon a progressive damage model and a maximum principal strain criterion. Very good correlation between experimental and predicted pull-through failure loads, failure location and failure sequence were achieved. This research constitutes work performed as part of the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS) task on highly loaded joints.",

This study explored the resistance to delamination under fatigue loading of carbon and glass fiber prepreg laminates with the same resin system, containing various ply drop geometries, and using thicker plies typical of wind turbine blades. Applied stress and strain levels to produce significant delamination at ply drops have been determined, and the experimental results correlated through finite element and analytical models. Carbon fiber laminates with ply drops, while performing adequately under static loads, delaminated in fatigue at low maximum strain levels except for the thinnest ply drops. The lower elastic modulus of the glass fiber laminates resulted in much higher strains to produce delamination for equivalent ply drop geometries. The results indicate that ply drops for carbon fibers should be much thinner than those commonly used for glass fibers in wind turbine blades.",

The reinforcement for the first composite was a random chopped-glass fiber, while the remaining two were reinforced with stitch-bonded carbon-fiber mats, one in a crossply layup, and the other in a quasi-isotropic layup. A pendulum device, representative of events such as tool drops, and a gas-gun projectile, representative of events such as kickups of roadway debris, were used to impact plate specimens. Brick-drop tests were also performed to assess the applicability of the baseline pendulum and gas-gun data to other events. Following the impacts, the damage areas were measured and the plates were cut into either tensile, standard compressive, or compression-after-impact specimens for determining strength degradation. The glass-fiber composite was least susceptible to damage, followed by the crossply carbon-fiber laminate, which had the same thickness. The quasi-isotropic carbon-fiber composite, which was thinner than the other two, sustained the most damage. While compressive strength was significantly degraded by moderate damage in the random-glass-fiber composite, tensile strength was not. On the other hand, both tensile and compressive strengths were degraded in the crossply carbon-fiber laminate (only compressive strength loss was measured in the quasi-isotropic laminate). Compressive strength degradation for a given damage area was similar in the two carbon-fiber laminates. Both showed lesser degradation than did the glass-fiber composite. For the quasi-isotropic carbon-fiber laminate, it was shown that strength degradation produced by an open circular hole provides a reasonable lower bound to the degradation due to an impact damage area of the same size. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Stress-strain curves are non-linear from very low strains for all loading angles and they exhibit a rapidly reducing tangent modulus with increasing strain. Acoustic emission results and the results of the cyclic loading, together with comparisons with the results on the model specimens in Part 1, suggest the following sequence of damage development: damage develops initially between yarns at the loop cross-over points in the knitted fabric structure, progresses to the development of matrix cracking damage from these initiation sites at weak planes in the composite due to the fabric architecture, and then to the pulling out of loops across matrix cracks. The pulling out of loops across matrix cracks, together with matrix non-linearity, gives rise to a stress-strain curve with a very low tangent modulus at high strains and to hysteresis loops which do not close on unloading and reloading. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The material is similar to those used by GRP wind turbine rotor blade manufacturers, i.e. hand lay-up and room temperature curing. The stacking sequence of the MD laminate under consideration is [0/(??45)2/0]T. Specimens were cut at five different off-axis directions from that laminate and over one hundred and forty tests were conducted under static and cyclic loading. Based on the test results the effect of off-axis loading on static and fatigue behaviour of the MD laminate is studied. A simple empirical model is used to predict the observed stiffness degradation and to determine stiffness based S-N curves by means of a limited number of test data. For the materials investigated in this program it is shown that E-modulus variation depends on the off-axis loading as much as on the applied cyclic stress level. Stiffness based S-N curves corresponding to 5-20% stiffness reduction are more conservative than standard S-N allowables of 95% reliability.",

Differences in failure mode and ultimate-load values are numerically investigated. A numerical home-made finite element model has been conceived, implemented, and validated by means of available experimental data. The numerical model is based on an incremental displacement-based approach and on a plane-stress bi-dimensional for- mulation. The stress analysis has been performed by accounting for micro-structural stress-strain localization mechanisms, and describing the progressive damage process by implementing a failure criterion operating at the constituents&#039; scale (namely, the Huang&#039;s criterion). Proposed results have highlighted that bolted joints based on basalt-FRP laminates and defined by a double- bolted configuration exhibited bearing failure loads comparable to those computed for glass-FRP and carbon-FRP laminates. In the case of single-bolted joints, the use of carbon-FRP laminates allowed to obtain the best mechanical properties, although joints based on basalt-FRP laminates numerically-experienced mechanical response and strength features always comparable with those of glass-FRP.",

The penetration impact properties and the residual tensile strength under various low-energy impacts were tested. The initial slope during penetration impact reveals that the thicker laminate has a higher stiffness than the thinner one. Moreover, the results also show that the total energy required to penetrate the composite is not proportional to the thickness. The static tensile strength measurements and tension-compression fatigue tests at various stress levels were also carried out on the impacted and unimpacted laminates. The median-rank method and Weibull distribution function were applied to predict the failure probability of the composites under given applied loading and fatigue cycles. The relationship between stress levels and fatigue life (S-N curve) was established and reductions in fatigue life of the impacted laminates at various stress levels were compared. The different slopes of the S-N curves imply that different fracture mechanisms may occur, depending on the laminate. The S-N curves of the composites with different thicknesses were also compared. Ultrasonic C-scanning was used to examine the damage zones in composites subjected to various impact energies and fatigue loadings.",

Experimental diffusion rate data are obtained from gravimetric analysis of T800/924 carbon fiber epoxy composites using Fickian absorption models adapted to account for hygro-elastic relaxation and polymer–penetrant interaction mechanisms. The transverse diffusion coefficient of the composite (Dz) is determined relative to that of the polymer matrix (Dp) and the ratio Dz/Dp is compared with experimental data provided in other published research. The experimental data, both from this investigation and that obtained from other sources, exhibit significant scatter and only limited correlation with a traditional flux-continuity model. The use of the adapted sorption models reduces experimental scatter by 60% through improved representation of the true sorption mechanics of polymer-based systems. The effects of fiber spatial distribution on the predictions of the flux-continuity model are also considered. There is found to be negligible difference between fully random and, the more commonly assumed and analyzed, regular-packed distributions. A novel finding of the investigation is an assessment of the effect layered high and low fiber volume fraction regions have on the transverse diffusivity of a composite. In such configurations, Dz/Dp is significantly reduced from that predicted using bulk composite properties, providing a possible explanation for the variation between some experimental data and predicted behavior.",

The carbon fabrics are thus of three types having areal densities between 200 and 600g/m2, and crimp ratios from 0.049 to 0.12. The laminates are manufactured through vacuum infusion process to minimize the effect of voids and poor resin regions. Tensile tests show serious differences in the behavior of the low and high areal density fabrics although the crimp ratio is about the same in some of the laminates. The low density fabric laminates show a linear stress-strain curve up to a sudden rupture of the laminate. The higher density fabric laminates present a stiffness degradation observed in their stress-strain curve which occurs after a plateau region or just a knee behavior. These high density fabric laminates encounter a severe delamination before the final failure.

One of the remaining problems is the analysis of the AE signals in order to identify the most critical damage mechanisms. In this work, unsupervised pattern recognition analyses (fuzzy C-means clustering) associated with a principal component analysis are the tools that are used for the classification of the monitored AE events. A cluster analysis of AE data is achieved and the resulting clusters are correlated to the damage mechanisms of the material under investigation. After being validated on model samples composed of unidirectional fiber-matrix composites, this method is applied to actual composites such as glass fiber/polyester cross-ply composites and sheet molding compound (SMC). Furthermore, AE signals generated by heterogeneous materials are not stationary. Thus, time-scale methods are used to determine new relevant descriptors to be introduced in the classification process in order to improve the characterization and the discrimination of the damage mechanisms. Continuous and discrete wavelet transforms are applied on typical damage mechanisms AE signals of glass fiber/polyester composites such as matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding. Time-scale descriptors are defined from these wavelet analyses. They provide a better discrimination of damage mechanisms than some time-based descriptors. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "This paper describes an investigation of in-plane elastic properties of impact damaged regions in composite laminates. Quasi-isotropic carbon fibre/epoxy laminates were impacted and the impact damage examined by ultrasonic C-scanning, optical microscopy and thermal deplying. After impact damage observations, specimens were cut from the laminates and tested in tension and compression. The elastic modulus of the impact damage was, in both tension and compression, mainly controlled by the amount of fibre breakage. Interestingly, layers with broken fibres could sustain some load in compression, which led to higher elastic modulus in compression than in tension. The effect of delaminations on the elastic modulus was quite small in both tension and compression. The through-the-thickness variation of in-plane stiffness was studied by successively removing plies. The variation in stiffness was negligible, probably as a result of the very uniform distribution of delaminations and fibre breakage through the thickn ess of the laminates. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Fatigue damage of (0/90) composite systems was obtained by integrating damage values and occurred in composite plies of 0 and 90 under fatigue cycles.

The MTM56/ CF0300 woven quasi-isotropic laminates were fabricated by two processes: the autoclave and the Quickstep processes. QuickstepTM is a novel composite manufacturing process, which was designed for the out-of-autoclave production of high-quality composite parts at lower cost. It utilizes higher heat conduction of fluid other than gas to transfer heat to components, which results in much shorter cure cycles. The laminates cured by this fast heating process showed different impact failure modes from those cured by the conventional autoclave process. The residual indentation in the top side of the Quickstep-cured laminates had a bigger diameter, but a smaller depth at the same impact energy level. Dye-penetrant X-ray revealed more intense and connected impact damage regions in the autoclave-cured laminates. Optical micrography as a supplementary method showed less severe matrix damage in the quickstep-cured laminates indicating a more ductile property of the resin matrix cured at a faster heating rate.",

The effects of loading rate and mode mixture on the inter-laminar fracture behavior of carbon-fiber/epoxy composite laminates were investigated over a very wide range of loading rate from static to impact. The macroscopic fracture toughness clearly showed loading rate dependence regardless of mode ratio, and consequently the mixed mode fracture criterion varied with loading rate. The microscopic fracture morphology also showed loading rate dependence; cohesive fracture of matrix resin itself was a dominant fracture mechanism at higher loading rate, whereas debonding of fiber/matrix interface was a dominant fracture mechanism at lower loading rate.",

The methodology undertaken consists of firstly, the numerical modelling of damage development in the FRP composite laminate. To capture the strain rate effects on the crush response, material models were formulated for each loading regime from experimental coupon tests under quasi-static and dynamic loads to retrieve input parameters for the material models. The second feature of the numerical methodology focuses on the implementation of innovative numerical triggers into the numerical models. These numerical triggers were designed to replicate in the numerical model, the initiation, propagation and complex failure mechanisms of the crush responses observed in the experimental crush tests.",

The presented model includes three phases, i.e. the fiber, coating and matrix, and two distinct interfaces, one between the fiber and coating and the other between coating and matrix. The model can be employed to investigate effects of various bonding levels of the interfaces on the initiation of damage during transverse loading of the composite system. Two different failure criteria, which are combinations of normal and shear stresses across the interfaces, were used to predict the failure of the fiber/coating (f/c) and coating/matrix (c/m) interfaces. Any interface fails as soon as the stress level reaches the interfacial strength. It was shown that in comparison with other interface models the predicted stress-strain curve for damaged interface demonstrates good agreement with experimental results. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficient nanoparticle dispersion within the matrix was attained without using surfactants. A progressive rise in thermal stability was found with increasing IF-WS 2 loading, as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis. The addition of low nanoparticle contents retarded the crystallization of the matrix, whereas concentrations equal or higher than 1.0 wt% increased both the crystallization temperature and degree of crystallinity compared to those of PPS/CF. Mechanical tests indicated that with only 1.0 wt% IF-WS 2 the flexural modulus and strength of PPS/CF improved by 17 and 14%, respectively, without loss in toughness, ascribed to a synergistic effect between the two fillers. A significant enhancement in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature was also observed. Moreover, the wear rate and coefficient of friction strongly decreased, attributed to the lubricant role of the IF-WS 2 combined with their reinforcing effect.

In the fatigue model, fatigue master curves from the ATM are used to determine the uniaxial ply fatigue strengths and the multi-axial fatigue failure is then determined by Puck&#039;s criterion with the fatigue strengths at the ply level. The fatigue master curves from ATM are generated with limited uniaxial fatigue tests and can be applied to fatigue loading conditions with various frequencies and stress ratios. Both uniaxial and multi-axial S-N curves can be derived from thefatigue model. Fatigue failure envelopes are also generated from the model to better interpret the multi-axial fatigue failure in multi-axial stress spaces. The proposed multi-axial fatigue model is based on ply-level predictions, but it can beextended to laminate-level predictions with the CLT or numerical methods such as the FEM. Multi-axial fatigue failures caused by either local or global multi-axiality can be predicted by the model. Both uniaxial and biaxial fatigue experimentswere carried out to provide test data for establishing and validating the proposed fatigue model. The application oftheproposed multi-axial fatigue model is demonstrated with predictions of S-N curves and fatigue failure envelopes of unidirectional laminates and multi-directional laminates with typical lay-up configurations. The predictions from the proposed fatigue model are also compared with various experimental results and reasonably good agreement is observed.",

Incompatible eight-noded brick elements with Taylor&#039;s modification and a successive coordinate transformation scheme are adopted. A modified Hertzian contact law is utilized to compute the contact force for an isotropic sphere on a cylindrical composite shell. The governing equation is integrated in time by the Newmark method. A scheme of detection of impact-induced damage is proposed for determining damage patterns resulting from low-velocity impact. The parametric study of the dynamic behavior of cylindrical composite shells with various curvatures and stacking sequences is presented. The results are compared with those of plates of the same dimensions and stacking sequences. As the curvature increases, the maximum impact force becomes higher for the same impact velocity. Although the delamination patterns of the cylindrical shell have a similar tendency to those of the plates, the delaminated area widens as the curvature increases.",

This has slowed their widespread application to thin, damage tolerance-critical primary structures such as fuselage pressure cabin skins. Therefore, impact tests were performed to determine the impact characteristics of Fibre Metal Laminates (GLARE and ARALL). Comparative low and high velocity impact tests were performed on monolithic aluminium, Fibre Metal Laminates. and carbon thermoplastic composites. Additional impact tests were performed on monolithic aluminium and ARALL specimens under tensile loading. The present article characterizes the impact properties of Fibre Metal laminates in comparison with other high-performance aerospace structural materials. The results demonstrate the superior behaviour of GLARE 3 compared with the other materials. The effect of the initial tensile loading on the damage size and the residual strength of ARALL is small for realistic operating stresses (S &lt; 200 MPa).",

The glass preforms were consolidated by application of heat and pressure over plies of the glass fabrics coated with various concentrations of a thermoplastic polyester binder. The peel strength of the preforms with various binder content was measured and the highest peel strength was obtained from preforms prepared with about 9 wt% of the binder. Composite laminates with and without binder were fabricated using VARTM technique and the effects of the binder on the composite mechanical properties were evaluated. It was found that the flexural strength and mode I interlaminar fracture toughness decreases by 15% and 40%, respectively, due to the presence of 3 wt% of the binder. Ballistic test was performed on E-glass/polyester composite panels using 1.1-g fragment-simulating projectiles and it was found that the binder amount has some considerable effect on the damage extension of the impacted composites.

Therefore, their fatigue behavior and modeling have been of much interest in recent years. This literature review presents a broad review of the many factors influencing cyclic deformation, fatigue behavior, and damage development in SFRPCs. These include microstructural related effects as well as effects related to loading condition and their service environment. Microstructural related effects include those related to fiber length, content and orientation, surface treatment, and failure mechanisms. Cyclic deformation and softening, viscous characteristics, and dissipative response used to characterize and model their fatigue damage behavior and accumulation are discussed. The effects of stress concentrations and their gradient on fatigue behavior are also discussed, due to their significant influence. The effects related to the loading condition include mean stress effects which may be accompanied by cyclic creep, variable amplitude loading, and multiaxial stress effects. Since fatigue behavior is substantially influenced by the testing frequency with self-heating as the primary consequence of increased frequency, this effect is also investigated. Environmental effects considered include the effects of moisture content and temperature, as well as thermo-mechanical fatigue behavior. The effect of welded joints in manufactured components made of SFRPCs and fatigue analysis and life estimation techniques used for such components are also included.",

          "abstract": "Fiber reinforced composites have been widely used in aerospace applications due to their functional properties, such as high strength-to-weight ratios. But many challenges remain to be overcome in order to permit more confidence in the performance of composite structures. In particular, composites have different failure types and modes that make damage prediction and propagation a very challenging subject. The main two damage types are matrix micro-cracking and delamination. Matrix micro-cracking develops first, causing delamination. The detection and quantification of matrix micro-cracks would provide the needed information to predict the development of delamination and the correct safety or maintenance decision to be made. The challenge in matrix micro-cracking identification is that it is a distributed damage, while delamination is a localized damage. The state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques are good at detecting and localizing major changes in sensor signals, which usually points to delamination, holes or other localized defects. Furthermore, there are a limited number of features that can be extracted from sensor signals, and most of them are affected by both delamination and matrix micro-cracking. The work presented in this paper aims at finding which features are more sensitive to each damage type (delamination or matrix micro-cracks), and applying machine learning techniques to learn and model a classifier that uses these features efficiently to classify the detected damage.",

Two types of hybrid boron/glass/aluminum FMLs were fabricated and studied, which consisted of aluminum alloy sheets as the metal layers and a mixture of boron fibers and glass fibers as the composite layers. For the first type, the boron fiber/prepreg and the glass fiber/prepreg were used separately in the composite layers, and for the second type, the boron fibers and the glass fibers were mingled together to form a hybrid boron/glass/prepreg composite layer. These hybrid FMLs were consolidated using an autoclave curing process. The incorporation of the boron fibers improved the Young&#039;s modulus of the composite layer in FMLs, which in turn, would improve the fatigue crack initiation life of the Al sheet. The experimental results clearly showed that the fatigue crack initiation lives for both types of hybrid boron/glass/aluminum FMLs were superior to the monolithic aluminum alloy under the same loading condition. An analytical approach was proposed to calculate the fatigue crack initiation lives of hybrid boron/glass/aluminum FMLs based on the classical laminate theory and the small-crack theory. A good correlation was obtained between the predictions and the experimental results. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

For these goals, impact tests were performed on the base (glass/epoxy laminates without SMA) and SMA laminates (glass/epoxy laminates with embedded SMA) under temperatures of 293 K, 263 K and 233 K. The resulting impact damage was measured by using a scanning acoustic microscope (SAM). The flexural tests were then carried out to investigate the post impact properties, namely the flexural strength and modulus at the aforementioned temperatures. The impact damage behavior of the base laminates was slightly affected by the temperatures, but the SMA laminates was a little more affected by the temperatures. The flexural modulus is not particularly sensitive to the presence of damage. However, the residual strength is considerably affected by the impact damage regardless of temperature. Also, the strength threshold energy is gradually decreased with a decreasing in temperature and the SMA laminates have a little higher threshold energy than the base laminates. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Unloading of the failed laminae and a subsequent failure progression of the laminae are included in the model. Results for failure onset and progression are presented for a wide variety of unidirectional and symmetric laminates under biaxial loading. The combined stress and strain state failure criterion based on strain energies of a nonlinear orthotropic material proposed by Sandhu is used. For an orthotropic material, the strain energies under uniaxial tension (or compression), transverse tension (or compression), and shear are all independent parameters. Sandhu&#039;s strain energy based failure theory, in conjunction with an incremental constitutive law, has shown good comparison with experimental investigations carried out on tubular specimens made of glass/epoxy and graphite/epoxy.",

          "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes carry the promise of enhancing the poor out-of-plane mechanical performance of fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPs). The present study is aimed to investigate the effect of adding multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to the epoxy matrix of a carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRP) on the composites’ damping performance, impact resistance and impact damage progression. Two sets of CFRPs with their matrices comprising MWCNTs–epoxy and neat epoxy, respectively, were fabricated and mechanically tested under tensile, Quasi-static punch test, vibration and intermediate velocity impact (IVI) environments. While the tensile failure strain of the carbon fiber reinforced epoxy–MWCNT composite increased, its tensile modulus and strength remained almost unaffected. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was employed to measure the damping performance of the two composite systems. The composite samples containing MWCNTs retained higher damping indicating their greater capability to attenuate impact shocks generated during an impact phenomenon. The samples were subjected to out-of-plane impact (at ∼100ms−1) from which the energy dissipation capacity of the composites was evaluated. Incorporating MWCNTs into the CFRP increased the absorbed impact energy by 21%. The punch test provided valuable information on the damage mechanics of the ballistic impact of the composite panels. It also contrasted the effect of high-stain-rate on the impact test. The consequences of adding MWCNTs to the matrix of CFRPs on the impact progressive damage and energy absorption were discussed in terms of the damage mechanisms and the dynamic damping behavior of the composites. To better comprehend the effect of adding CNTs on the impact damage mechanisms, X-ray radiography was carried out on the impacted panels. It was shown that the addition of MWCNTs to the matrix of a CFRP improves its inter- and intra-laminar mechanical performance yielding a better impact resistance. It was confirmed that the impact failure behavior of the studied composite systems could be predicted from the quasi-static and dynamic mechanical tests.",

One defect type consisted of equal spaced tunnel cracks that resulted from anisotropic thermal contraction of the laminates after processing. The second consisted of void-like defects resulting from missing groups of fibers. Like the tunnel cracks, this defect extended many centimeters in a ply&#039;s fiber direction. While tunnel cracks were healed upon out of plane compression, and therefore have little effect on a laminates out of plane compressive strength, the missing fiber defects significantly degraded the compressive strength. However, the degradation was reduced by increasing the laminate thickness. Compression tests using pressure sensitive film and acoustic emission monitoring reveal that regions containing missing fiber defects are shielded from load by defect free regions, which then fail at lower sample pressure during loading. A simple statistical model is used to simulate the distribution of missing fiber defects as local reductions in ply thickness, and reproduced the contrast observed in optical and ultrasonic images, as well as the reduction in out of plane compressive strength observed in experiments.",

In this study, the inelastic energy absorption mechanisms associated with damage at the interfacial and constituent levels were numerically characterized through three admissible failure modes: fiber breakage, matrix shearing, and fiber/matrix debonding (delamination) (i.e., cohesive failure). The UD composite was constructed of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers separately reinforced with a polymer matrix material. The energy absorption capacities of these damage mechanisms were contrasted for three different dynamic loading cases including blast, shock, and ballistic impact at three different energy levels. Energy loss due to cohesive failure was observed in all three loading cases and energy levels. Furthermore, energy loss due to matrix failure was observed at all energy levels for the blast case, but only for the highest energy level in the shock and ballistics. There was energy loss due to fiber failure in the blast and in the highest energy ballistics impact case. However, there was not any fiber damage in the shock case.",

Yet these equations, because they require the partial derivatives of displacement to be known throughout the region modeled, are in some ways unsuitable for the modeling of discontinuities caused by damage, in which these derivatives fail to exist. As a means of avoiding this limitation, the peridynamic model of solid mechanics has been developed for applications involving discontinuities. The objective of this method is to treat crack and fracture as just another type of deformation, rather than as pathology that requires special mathematical treatment. The peridynamic theory is based on integral equations so there is no problem in applying the equations across discontinuities. The peridynamic method has been applied successfully to damage and failure analysis in composites. It predicts in detail the delamination and matrix damage process in composite laminates due to low velocity impact, and the simulation results of damage area correlates very well with the experimental data",

Continuum damage mechanics was applied to account for the change of mechanical properties of damaged materials. The Hertzian contact law was modified in order to accommodate the serious damage in the plate. A semi-empirical delamination damage criterion was introduced. A finite element program was written in FORTRAN using twenty-noded solid elements with layered structure to analyze the transient dynamic response of composite laminates. In the simulation computations, variable material damping coefficients were applied to the elements according to damage in order to stabilize the computation.

The simulation was applied to notched Ti/CFRP hybrid laminates of two stacking configurations. In both cases, the crack growth rate in the titanium layer and the delamination shape agreed well with experiments reported in the literature. Complementary analysis for crack extension in the metal sheet is performed out of consideration of the damage in internal FRP layers.

The proposed methodology employs a network of transducers that are used to sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates. Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to the transducers. The results show that the method enables the reliable detection of structural damage with locating inaccuracies of the order of a few millimeters inside as well as outside of an inspection area of 100 Ã 100mm2.

The graphite/PMR-15 com- posite was chosen for study because of the extensive amount of experience that has been amassed in the processing of this material. Composite densities and fiber contents of more than 30 different laminates were measured along with interlaminar shear strengths. Void contents were calculated and the void geometry and distribution were noted using micro- scope techniques such as those used in metallography. A good empirical correlation be- tween ILSS and composite density was found. However, the most acceptable relationship between the ILSS and density was found to be a power equation that closely resembles theoretically derived expressions. As the void content increased, an increase in scatter in the strength data was observed. In laminates with low void content, the voids appeared to be more segregated in one area of the laminate. We found that void-free composites could be processed in matched metal die molds at pressures greater than 1.4 MPa and less than 6.9 MPa.",

A significant effect of this damage is to reduce the strength of the laminate, particularly in compression; however, owing to the complexity of the damage the precise mechanisms controlling the strength reduction are unclear. In this paper a technique is described for replicating impact damage artificially by including PTFE film delaminants and cut plies during lay-up. Comparisons between real and artificially reproduced damage are made to demonstrate the validity of the technique. Experimental methods of X-radiography and resin injection are developed to allow the mechanisms controlling strength reduction to be assessed, both under tensile and compressive loading. Under tensile load the reduction in strength caused by impact damage is found to be entirely due to fibre cracks and may be estimated by using a net-section calculation. Meanwhile under compression, strength reduction is largely caused by the redistribution of stress resulting from buckling of delaminated plies and may be predicted by calculating stresses in the undelaminated part of the laminate. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science Limited All rights reserved.",

With this model we analyze the dynamic effects induced by different types of dynamic loading on the fracture and damage behavior of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites. In contrast to the results expected from quasi-static loading, the simulations show that dynamic conditions can lead to co-existence of and transitions between fracture modes; matrix shattering can happen before a splitting crack propagates. We observe matrix-fiber splitting fracture, matrix cracking, and crack migration in the matrix, including crack branching in the matrix similar to what is observed in recent dynamic experiments. The new model works for arbitrary fiber orientation relative to a uniform discretization grid and also works with random discretizations. The peridynamic composite model captures significant differences in the crack propagation behavior when dynamic loadings of different intensities are applied. An interesting result is branching of a splitting crack into two matrix cracks in transversely loaded samples. These cracks branch as in an isotropic material but here they migrate over the &quot;fiber bonds&quot;, without breaking them. This behavior has been observed in recent experiments. The strong influence that elastic waves have on the matrix damage and crack propagation paths is discussed. No special criteria for splitting mode fracture (Mode II), crack curving, or crack arrest are needed, and yet we obtain all these modes of material failure as a direct result of the peridynamic simulations. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

In this paper, a composite laminate with curvilinear fiber paths is designed to maximize simultaneously its in-plane stiffness and buckling load. After obtaining the Pareto front through a surrogate-based optimization algorithm, two variable stiffness laminates among the solution set are selected that can be manufactured by an Automated Fiber Placement machine. Due to the characteristics of the manufacturing process, defects appearing in the form of gaps and/or overlaps emerge within the composite laminate. MATLAB subroutines are developed here to capture the location and extent of the defects. A novel method, called defect layer, is proposed to characterize the change in properties of each layer in the composite laminates that results from the occurrence of gaps and overlaps. Such a method allows calculating the in-plane stiffness and buckling load of a composite laminate with embedded defects. The results show that by incorporating gaps in the laminates the buckling load improvement resulting from fiber steering reduces by 15% compared to the laminates where gaps are ignored. A maximum improvement of 71% in the buckling load over the quasi-isotropic laminates can be observed for a variable stiffness laminate built with a complete overlap strategy. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

During the fatigue cycling, the strain within a defined area in the vicinity of the crack was measured directly using embedded fibre-optic Bragg grating sensors. The progress of delamination damage was monitored by means of an in situ ultrasonic C-scanning technique. A simplified empirical model has been applied to determine an effective stress intensity factor applied to the crack tip in the alloy material. Fatigue crack growth rate in the hybrid laminate, characterised using the effective stress intensity factor, was demonstrated to be in reasonable agreement with the data for the monolithic aluminium alloy, showing that the methods used to partition the load were reliable. The paper thus demonstrates a viable technology for in situ strain measurements, offers a new insight into the damage mechanisms that prevail in hybrid laminates, and validates simplified procedures for estimating crack growth. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Panels were made with [45/0/-45/90]2 S and [45/0/-45/0]2S layups. The buffer strips were parallel to the loading direction. They were made by replacing narrow strips of the 0{degrees} graphite plies with strips of either 0{degrees} S-Glass/epoxy or Kevlar-90/epoxy on either a one-for-one or a two-for-one basis. In a third case, 0{degrees} graphite/epoxy was used as the buffer material and thin, perforated Mylar strips were placed between the 0{degrees} plies and the cross-plies to weaken the interfaces and thus to isolate the 0{degrees} plies. Some panels were made with buffer strips of different width and spacings.  The buffer strips arrested the cracks and increased the residual strengths significantly over those of plain laminates without buffer strips. A shear-lag type stress analysis correctly predicted the effects of layup, buffer materi al, buffer strip width and spacing, and the number of plies of buffer material.",

The emphasis was on understanding the mechanisms and mechanics of constituent damage evolution, and their effects on fatigue life. Most tests were performed at an R-ratio of 0.1, but limited fully-reversed (R = -1) tests were conducted. In regime 1, damage was fiber failure dominated, but the exact mechanisms were different at room and elevated temperatures. In regime 2, observation of matrix cracks and persistent slip bands provided convincing evidence of matrix dominated damage. Weak fiber-matrix interfaces contributed to crack bridging. However, fiber fracture also played an important role in regime 2; tension-tension and tension-compression tests showed similar lives on a maximum fiber stress basis, although the strain range, which primarily controls matrix crack growth, was almost double for R = -1 compared with R = 0 or 0.1. Good agreement was obtained from the different R-ratio tests, between the MMC and matrix data, and data at room and elevated temperatures, when compared based on the strain range in the tension part of a cycle. Analyses and observations of fiber pull-out lengths and fiber fractures in the matrix crack wake provided evidence of fiber damage; the analyses also helped to explain increased fiber bridging with fiber volume fraction. Issues of fatigue life prediction are briefly discussed. © 1995.",

Single-edge notched multi-layered unidirectional graphite composites (T800/3900-2) are investigated to examine fracture responses under static and dynamic loading conditions using a digital speckle correlation method. The fracture parameters for growing cracks are extracted as a function of fiber orientation. A 2D digital image correlation (DIC) method is used to obtain time-resolved full-field in-plane surface displacements when specimens are subjected to quasi-static and impact loading. Stress intensity factor and crack extension histories for pure mode-I and mixed mode cases are extracted from the full-field displacements. When compared to the dynamic stress intensity factors at crack initiation, the static values are found to be consistently lower. The stress intensity factor histories exhibit a monotonic reduction under dynamic loading conditions whereas an increasing trend is seen after crack initiation under quasi-static loading cases. This is potentially due to dominant crack face fiber bridging effects in the latter cases. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

While drilling on composite/metal stacks has been investigated, the drilling of GLARE, which consists of several alternate thin layers of aluminium and composites, has not been addressed separately in the open literature. The focus of present experimental work is to understand the cutting mechanism and relative effect of cutting parameters and tool geometry on the delamination and burr formation during drilling of GLARE. Thrust force, torque and acoustic emission (AE) signals were acquired for analyzing the cutting mechanism, burr and delamination formation. Also, several measurements of burrs, delamination and hole size were taken in order to understand the hole quality. It has been observed that, 2-fluted drill is the best out of four different geometries used, giving zero delamination and acceptable burr formation followed by the 4-faceted drills. The conventional 3-fluted and 8-faceted drills that are otherwise superior for drilling of fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) composites, performed poorly in drilling of the GLARE laminates. Analyzing the processing parameters, feed again has a dominant role in controlling delamination and burr formation than speed.",

          "abstract": "The three major fatigue damage mechanisms of transverse yarn cracking, inter-yarn debonding, and delamination in a 5-harness satin woven graphite/epoxy composite were modeled using simple mechanistic models. Each of the three models was able to capture the salient features of the woven fabric architecture and also the physics of the damage mechanism. The interaction between the three damage mechanisms was implicitly modeled by including (i) the effect of matrix cracking in the stiffness model for inter-yarn debonding and (ii) the effects of matrix cracking and inter-yarn debonding in stiffness model for delamination. These models were used to determine the effect of the three major damage mechanisms on the laminate stiffness loss during fatigue. The predictions for laminate stiffness loss were compared with tension-tension fatigue test data. By using these damage mechanism models together with interlaminar fatigue delamination growth data (da/dN), it was possible to assess the fatigue life of the woven composite laminate. The fatigue life predictions compared reasonably well with test data. The present fatigue modeling technique should be very useful in designing with woven composite laminates, especially since it can provide estimates of both the fatigue stiffness degradation and the fatigue life.",

The experiment is based on an idea that the stress field at the crack tip area becomes a mode-III fracture field when a prismatic bar specimen with uniform embedded delamination is twisted (edge crack torsion (ECT) specimen). The mechanism is simply proved through a superposition technique. An explicit approximate expression to estimate energy-release rate is derived. The possible energy release rate attained without shear failure or severe non-linearity is also given and found to be increased roughly in proportion to the thickness of the specimen. Since the attainable G(III) value without severe damage in the other portions may not be large enough to measure the fracture toughness of tough fiber-reinforced-plastic composites of the usual coupon size, it may be necessary for the specimens to be modified in order to obtain the mode-III interlaminar toughness, G(IIIc). The present experimental method is still attractive as a test method to measure mode-III fracture toughness of the composite laminates owing to its simplicity which compares well with the DCB and ENF testing methods.",

One method is based on the linear regression analysis and the other on the Bayesian approach.

In view of the recent interest in 3D woven composites from aerospace as well as non-aerospace sectors, this paper aims to provide an understanding of the impact damage resistance as well as damage tolerance of 3D woven composites. Four different 3D woven architectures, orthogonal, angle interlocked, layer-to-layer and modified layer-to-layer structures, have been produced under identical weaving conditions. Two additional structures, Unidirectional (UD) cross-ply and 2D plain weave, have been developed for comparison with 3D weaves. All the four 3D woven laminates have similar order of magnitude of damage area and damage width, but significantly lower than UD and 2D woven laminates. Damage Resistance, calculated as impact energy per unit damage area, has been shown to be significantly higher for 3D woven laminates. Rate of change of CAI strength with impact energy appears to be similar for all four 3D woven laminates as well as UD laminate; 2D woven laminate has higher rate of degradation with respect to impact energy. Undamaged compression strength has been shown to be a function of average tow waviness angle. Additionally, 3D weaves exhibit a critical damage size; below this size there is no appreciable reduction in compression strength. 3D woven laminates have also exhibited a degree of plasticity during compression whereas UD laminates fail instantly. The experimental work reported in this paper forms a foundation for systematic development of computational models for 3D woven architectures for damage tolerance.",

The results of tensile tests clearly showed that high modulus FMLs with a good ductility can be achieved by mingling of boron and glass fibers. The effects of notch sizes and constituents on the failure behavior were determined. The experiments showed that the notched hybrid FMLs exhibited excellent strength retaining characteristics even with the presence of large notches. Microscopy, X-ray radiography and chemical removal technique were used to examine the fracture characteristics of hybrid FMLs. A finite element analysis (FEA) model was established to analyze the notch behavior of hybrid FMLs.

The motivation for using the CZEs is to avoid experimental correlation factors by directly simulating the subcritical damage mechanisms, which initiate and grow before the catastrophic failure of the joints. The CZEs, placed in the experimentally determined damage locations, receive shear loads and the corresponding shear stresses cause stress concentration relief around the hole boundary. Therefore, a simple maximum stress failure criterion is used to predict the final failure of the joints when the stress level at the 0° layers reaches the ultimate compressive strength. It is shown that the effect of various joint geometries and laminate lay-ups on the joint strength can be accurately accounted for by the method developed.",

Quantitative data were obtained, displaying the reduction in modulus for each material system.

          "abstract": "The objective of this research is to develop a macroscopic theory, which can provide the connection between macro-mechanics and micro-mechanics in characterizing the micro-stress of composite laminates in regions of high macroscopic stress gradients. The micro-polar theory, a class of higher-order elasticity theory, of composite laminate mechanics is implemented in a well-known Pipes-Pagano free edge boundary problem. The micro-polar homogenization method to determine the micro-polar anisotropic effective elastic moduli is presented. A displacement-based finite element method based on micro-polar theory in anisotropic solids is developed in analyzing composite laminates. The effects of fiber volume fraction and cell size on the normal stress along the artificial interface resulting from ply homogenization of the composite laminate are also investigated. The stress response based on micro-polar theory is compared with those deduced from the micro-mechanics and classical elasticity theory. Special attention of the investigation focuses on the stress fields near the free edge where the high macro-stress gradient occurs. The normal stresses along the artificial interface and especially, the micro-stress along the fiber/matrix interface on the critical cell near the free edge where the high macro-stress gradient detected are the focus of this investigation. These micro-stresses are expected to dominate the failure initiation process in composite laminate. A micro-stress recovery scheme based on micro-polar analysis for the prediction of interface micro-stresses in the critical cell near the free edge is found to be in very good agreement with &quot;exact&quot; micro-stress solutions. It is demonstrated that the micro-polar theory is able to capture the micro-stress accurately from the homogenized solutions. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

These experiments show that failure in tension occurs in several stages (similar to certain other brittle fiber composites): multiple matrix cracking, followed by fiber fracture and pullout. In flexural loading the failure process is more complex. Consequently, the flexural test cannot be used for measurement of tensile strength (although it can be used for measurement of the stress for matrix cracking). The application of conventional fracture mechanics to describe tensile failure is discussed. The in situ observations provide direct indication of the importance of frictional bonding between the matrix and fibers. Some novel methods for measuring the frictional forces and residual stresses are investigated, and the influence of surface damage on strength is assessed.",

Treatments including alkalization, acetylation, cyanoethylation, the use of silane coupling agent, and heating were carried out to modify the fiber surface and its internal structure. As indicated by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and tensile tests, variations in composition, structure, dimensions, morphology and mechanical properties of the sisal fibers can be induced by means of different modification methods. When the treated fibers were incorporated into an epoxy matrix, mechanical characterization of the laminates revealed the importance of two types of interface; one between fiber bundles and the matrix and the other between the ultimate cells. In general, fiber treatments can significantly improve adhesion at the former interface and also lead to ingress of the matrix resin into the fibers, obstructing pull-out of the cells. As a result, the dependence of laminate mechanical properties on treatment methods becomes complicated. On the basis of a detailed analysis, the relationship between optimized fiber treatment and performance improvement of sisal composites was proposed. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results show that impact strength improves with fiber content and fiber length. In addition, longitudinal fiber mats always exhibit better impact toughness compared to transverse fiber mats. Impact strength is improved with the number of fiber layers but worsened by the fiber spacing. As for coir/polyester concrete, low fiber content and fiber length improve the impact strength.

The analysis is based considering both global and local effects. The influence of through-the-thickness normal stress on the magnitudes of inplane stresses is also considered. The plate is impacted by an impactor with a hemispherical tip. Contact force at the impact point, lateral displacements and velocities of the plate and the impactor and the stress state within the plate have been determined using modal solution technique. The governing equations, which apply to small deflection elastic response of specially orthotropic laminates, include combined effects of shear deformation and rotary inertia and non-linear Hertzian contact law. Inplane and interlaminar failure functions have been determined using quadratic failure criteria. Based on failure functions, damage initiation in the form of yarn/fiber breakage has been predicted. In general, it is observed that overall failure function is lower for woven fabric composites than for crossply laminates made of unidirectional layers. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the numericalmodel, interface cohesive elementswere inserted between neighbouring finite elements that run parallel to fibre orientation in each lamina to simulate matrix cracking with the assumption of equally spaced cracks (based on experimental measurements and observations). The stress based traction-separation law was introduced to simulate initiation of matrix cracking and propagation under mixed-mode loading. The numerically predicted crack density was found to depend on the mesh size of the model and the material fracture parameters defined for the cohesive elements. Numerical predictions of matrix crack density as a function of applied stress are in a good agreement to experimentally measured and theoretically (ECM) obtained values, but some further refinement will be required in near future work.",

          "abstract": "Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) usage in the aerospace industry has been steadily increasing due to its superior material properties such as high strength, low weight, high resistance to corrosion, and a low thermal expansion coefficient. In addition, CFRP parts are produced near-net-shape, a process that eliminates rough machining operations. However, machining operations such as drilling, side milling, and slotting are still necessary to give the CFRP parts their final shape. A majority of the studies on machining of CFRP laminates are on drilling. The number of studies on milling of CFRPs is quite limited. In this study, a mechanistic cutting force model for milling CFRPs is proposed based on experimentally collected cutting force data during slot milling of unidirectional CFRP laminates using two different polycrystalline diamond cutters. Cutting force coefficients in radial and tangential directions are calculated as a function of fiber cutting angle. The relationship is represented with simple sine functions. The mechanistic model is shown to be capable of predicting cutting forces during milling of multidirectional CFRP laminates. The experimental milling force measurements and predicted milling forces agree well with each other. Surface milling experiments were also conducted to investigate the relationship between milling forces and surface quality. Some suggestions on surface milling of CFRP laminates are given based on these observations. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The material properties have been taken as random variables for accurate prediction of the system behaviour. The basic formulation of the problem has been developed based on the classical laminate theory and the Von-Karman non-linear strain-displacement relationship. A first order perturbation technique has been used to obtain the second order response statistics. Typical results have been presented for a plate with all edges simply supported. A comparison has been drawn with Monte Carlo simulation results for validation of the proposed approach.

The obtained results clearly show that creep and fatigue are mutually influencing phenomena. Compared to the reference fatigue behaviour (with no prior loading), the fatigue life can be significantly extended with prior creep depending on loading conditions. Indeed, the strain accumulation seems to slow down after a long time creep preload, as if the time-dependent mechanisms were &quot;evacuated&quot; during this preload. The same conclusion can be drawn for the damage accumulation when the prior creep stresses are higher than the damage threshold or when the hold time is long enough, inducing significant plastic deformations. In angle-ply laminates, such deformations are associated with the reorientation of fibres. They contribute to the reduction of stress intensities, which results in increasing both fatigue life and maximum strain Émax at failure during fatigue loadings. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Ground fiber was compounded into polypropylene (PP) by means of a twin-screw compounder. Maleated polypropylene (MAPP) was used as a coupling agent during compounding. The incorporated fiber contents for OPB composites were 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% (by weight). The compounded samples were prepared into test specimens by injection molder. The composites were characterized by tensile testing, flexural testing, impact testing, melt flow index, and SEM. The analysis of variance of the effects of fiber types, fiber mesh sizes, and fiber contents and their interactions on the OPB-PP composite properties were studied and found to affect on composite properties significantly. The most significant effect on strength and modulus was found by the addition of coupling agent which was suggested to be due to the thermodynamic segregation of the MAPP toward the interface resulting in covalent bonding to the -OH groups on the fiber surface.",

The results in the fiber direction report no improvement of the Young&#039;s modulus and a slight improvement of the strength and strain-to-failure. The most important result of the study is a notion that CNTs have a hindering effect on the formation of transverse cracks. The conclusion is drawn from a combined analysis of the acoustic emission measurements (reporting a pronounced shift of all damage development thresholds towards higher strains by more than 30%) and X-ray/SEM observations (revealing a lower crack density in the CNT modified composite). The same analysis also indicates that the mechanism of energy dissipation through transverse microcracking is partially replaced by another mechanism that promotes (distributed) damage through fiber debonding. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Laser beam cutting offers an ideal means for the cutting of fibre composite materials, being a non-contact and virtually force-free manufacturing method. However, in the shaping operation of composite materials after curing, thermal damage associated with laser energy can be produced. It leads to poor assembly tolerance and long-term performance deterioration. In the current investigations, 3-dimensional anisotropic heat conduction models based on moving point heat source for thermal analysis are presented to predict heat affected zone (HAZ). Also, the conductivity models allow to consider the anisotropic heat conductivity for unidirectional (UD) and [0/90] laminates. Taking the immersing heat source and Mirror Image Method into account would further improve the prediction of HAZ. Extensive experiments were conducted on composite materials to examine HAZ, and compared with experimental results. The analytical results show a good agreement with experiments.",

Standard carbon/epoxy tensile specimens were fabricated from unidirectional pre-impregnated material using two different manufacturing techniques that produced two different levels of surface roughness. Fiber volume fraction variation was computed by analyzing optical micrographs of the samples. During loading and unloading of the samples two-dimensional surface strain fields were measured on the specimen using digital image correlation. It was shown that in both cases the strain in the specimen is not uniform, as is generally assumed. Using finite element simulations the effects of fiber volume fraction variation and thickness variation were modeled individually and in combination. The simulations agree well with the experimental results and suggest that thickness variations are the dominant mechanisms involved in this elastic strain inhomogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Machining processes are generally used to cut; drill, or contour composite laminates for building products. In fact, drilling is one of the most commonly used manufacturing processes to install fasteners for assembly of laminate composites. The material anisotropy resulting from fiber reinforcement heavily influences the machinability during machining. Machining of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) components is often needed in spite of the fact that most FRP structures can be made to near-net shape and drilling is the most frequently employed secondary machining process for fiber reinforced materials. Therefore, the precise machining needs to perform to ensure dimensional stability and to obtain a better productivity of the component. The drilling parameters and specimen parameters evaluated were speed, feed rate, drill size and specimen thickness. A series of experiments were conducted using TRIAC VMC CNC machining center to machine the composite laminate specimens at various cutting parameters and material parameters. The measured results of delamination at the entry and exit side of the specimen were measured and analyzed using commercial statistical software MINITAB14. The experimental results indicated that the specimen thickness, feed rate and cutting speed are reckoned to be the most significant factors contributing to the delamination. A signal-to-noise ratio is employed to analyze the influence of various parameters on peel up and push down delamination factor in drilling of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composite laminates. The main objective of this study is to determine factors and combination of factors that influence the delamination using Taguchi and response surface methodology and to achieve the optimization machining conditions that would result in minimum delamination. From the analysis it is evident that among the all significant parameters, specimen thickness and cutting speed have significant influence on peel up delamination and the specimen thickness and feed have more significant influence on push down delamination. Confirmation experiments were conducted to verify the predicted optimal parameters with the experimental results, good agreement between the predicted and experimental results obtained to be of the order of 99%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "Detecting impact damage is an important factor in maintaining the structural integrity of aerospace composite structures. Since impacts can cause severe reductions in stiffness and strength of composite structures, there is a need to investigate the material&#039;s stiffness and strength after an impact event. The work discussed in this paper is concerned with one overall goal, which is to determine if an impact has caused damage and then to determine the extent of that damage using only the structural responses that are acquired from low-profile surface-mounted transducers. The work presented in this paper demonstrates that responses recorded from these sensors can provide sufficient information to infer impact damage. Previous work by various authors has established that it is possible to distinguish between damaging and non-damaging impacts if the impact force time-history is available. Therefore, it is the requirement that only response data be used here that distinguishes this work from the previous studies. Following a systematic series of experiments, on the induction of impact damage in Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) laminates, a damage model was proposed from this work which can provide preliminary information on the type and extent of damages through observations made from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray radiography. The model can be used to provide a general understanding on the prediction of damage and failure progression in CFRP as a function of the number of layers and impact energies. To accommodate the results from SEM and X-ray, discussions on outlier analysis and visualisation, which emphasise the idea of discordancy from the discipline of statistics, are presented. Results from discordancy tests, for both univariate and multivariate data, can be used to clearly separate the data (non-damaging and damaging impacts as well as the separation of the type of failure modes) by a calculated threshold value. Both of these features (univariate and multivariate) can be used as damage indicators and proxies for determining the extent of damage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Repeated drop tests were conducted using an in-house built drop weight impact tester. Number of drops to failure (Nf), was considered as the impact damage tolerance index. Correlations between Nf and composite material parameters (fiber weight fraction - Wf, laminate thickness - t, number of fabric layers - L) and a test parameter (incident impact energy - E) were found out and the bounding limits for these were defined. Critical values of impact energy (Ec) and laminate thickness (tc) were defined (for the particular resin - hardener system chosen for the study) which can quite possibly be used as designer’s guidelines. A new ratio, (t/Wf), was introduced for the study of composite systems where both fiber weight fraction and laminate thickness get affected upon alteration of a process parameter (the pressure - P as in this case).",

Thermal treatment at 300°C, the phenolic resin began to pyrolyze and shrink resulted in the irreversible damage of the composites. After 550°C thermal treatment, the phenolic resin pyrolyzed mostly but the PBO fiber had no obvious pyrolyze, the interface had sever broken. After 700°C thermal treatment, the phenolic resin formed amorphous carbonaceous and PBO fiber pyrolyzed mostly so the mechanical properties dropped dramatically. At being heated at 800°C for 5min, the fiber was nearly totally pyrolyzed and and kept fibrous carbonaceous although the specimen became too brittle to stand any load thereon.",

The strain rate effects of most unfilled polymers can be described by the Eyring theory of viscosity which assumes that the deformation of a polymer involves the motion of a chain molecule over potential energy barriers. The Eyring model suggests that yield stress varies linearly with the logarithm of strain rate. In the present study, tensile tests were performed on a glass epoxy laminate at different rates of strain to determine the effects of strain rate on the Poisson&#039;s ratio of the material. In addition, further tests were conducted at varying fibre contents to verify the relationship between fibre content and Poisson&#039;s ratio. The findings from the experimental results suggest that Poisson&#039;s ratio is not sensitive to strain rate. In addition, it was suggested that the absence of rate sensitivity in the Poisson&#039;s ratio of the laminates tested is due to the presence of fibres in the composites.",

          "abstract": "Low velocity impacts to fibre reinforced plastic composites cause a pattern of damage consisting in general of delamination, fibre breakage and matrix cracking. Such damage is accidental and may go unnoticed; therefore composite structures must be designed assuming impact damage exists. Previous work on flat composite laminates has resulted in a reasonable understanding of the mechanisms of compressive strength reduction. There are, however, many instances where curved laminates are used in structures where impact is likely. Furthermore, due to the mechanisms of strength reduction, it may be expected that curvature would have a significant effect on the behaviour of the laminates. The work described here consists of experimental measurement of the post-impact compressive strength of curved GFRP laminates. The laminates were of 8 plies of 0.3mm thick pre-impregnated glass fibre/epoxy tape in a (0, ??45, 0??)s lay-up. Each laminate was 200mm in length by 50mm wide with the plane of curvature normal to the length. Laminates were impacted on the convex surface of the laminate by dropping a steel mass from 1m vertically above it. Impacted laminates were loaded in compression and the out-of-plane displacements of the top and bottom surfaces were recorded. Final failure was typically due to fibre breakage occurring through the centre of the impacted area of the laminate. Possible differences in the impact response, and measurable differences in the sizes of the impact damage area, were found to arise from these curvatures, and differences were observed in their post-impact buckling behaviour. However, perhaps unexpectedly, the post-impact compressive strength for a curved laminate was found to be similar to that for a flat laminate. The failure loads for the impact damage laminates are shown to be comparable with those for laminates containing artificial delaminations. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The optimum flexural strength of the composites was achieved at 30 wt % fiber loading. However, the flexural modulus of the composites kept increasing with increasing fiber loading. Increasing the fiber loading led to a drop in the impact strength of about 57.5-73.6%; this was due to the stiff nature of the KBF. The effect of the fiber length (5, 10, 15, and 20 mm) on the flexural and impact properties was investigated for the 30 wt % KBF loaded composites. The composites with 10-mm KBF showed the highest flexural and impact properties in comparison to the others. The inferior flexural and impact strength of the composites with 15- and 20-mm KBF could be attributed to the relatively longer fibers that underwent fiber attrition during compounding, which consequently led to the deterioration of the fiber. This was proven by analyses of the fiber length, diameter, and aspect ratio. The addition of maleated PBS as a compatibilizer resulted in the enhancement of the composite&#039;s flexural and impact properties due to the formation of better fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion. This was proven by scanning electron microscopy observations of the composites&#039; fracture surfaces. The removal of unreacted maleic anhydride and dicumyl peroxide residuals from the compatibilizers led to better fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion and a slightly enhanced composite strength.

The model includes the delamination growth in three domains, namely subcritical, linear, and final fracture. The resistance increases due to matrix cracking and fiber bridging in the case of unidirectional composites; and tow splitting, separation, bridging and breaking in the case of woven/braided fiber composites were included through normalization of the applied load (GImax) by the instantaneous resistance value (GIR). The proposed method was applied to mode I loaded woven roving glass/vinyl ester delaminated composite. The ASTM standard mode I fracture test was conducted to determine the resistance (GIR) as a function of delamination extension. The fatigue onset life test was conducted to determine the threshold energy release rate, GIth. Constant amplitude cyclic opening displacement fatigue test was conducted to establish the delamination growth rate (da/dN) as a function of maximum cyclic energy release rate (GImax). The total life delamination growth rate was found to be da/dN=A(GImax/GIR)m(1-(GIth/GImax))D1/(1-(GImax/GIR))D2 where the material constants A, m, D1, and D2 were 0.1, 5.4, 8 and 2, respectively.

While the damage mechanisms of composites under dynamic compression loading are well-understood, measuring the occurrence of damage in a non-invasive manner is challenging. Toward this end, we investigate the electrical response of an embedded percolating carbon nanotube network in woven fabric/epoxy composites to dynamic compression loading. The percolating network is established through the use of a non-uniform dispersion of carbon nanotubes, achieved using a fiber sizing agent. The resulting conductive network is sensitive to delamination and damage occurring near the fiber surfaces. The dynamic mechanical response of the composite specimens is explored using Hopkinson bar methodology. Definite increases in baseline resistance of the conductive composite specimens are seen after repeated impacts demonstrating the ability of the carbon nanotube network of these conductively modified composites to respond electrically to damage induced during dynamic loading.",

Strain rate behavior of composites with fiber waviness was also studied. Falling weight impact system and servohydraulic testing machine were used for dynamic characterisation of composite materials in compression at strain rates up to several hundred per second. Strain rates below 10 s-1 were generated using a hydraulic testing machine. Strain rates above 10 s-1 were generated using the drop tower apparatus developed. Seventy-two-ply unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminates (IM6G/3501-6) loaded in the longitudinal and transverse directions and [(08/908)2/08]s crossply laminates were characterised. Off-axis (30 and 45°) compression tests of the same unidirectional material were also conducted to obtain the in-plane shear stress-strain behavior. The 90° properties, which are governed by the matrix, show an increase in modulus and strength over the static values but no significant change in ultimate strain. The shear stress-strain behavior, which is also matrix-dominated, shows high nonlinearity with a plateau region at a stress level that increases significantly with increasing strain rate. The 0° and crossply laminates show higher strength and strain values as the strain rate increases, whereas the modulus increases only slightly over the static value. The increase in strength and ultimate strain observed may be related to the shear behavior of the composite and the change in failure modes. In all cases the dynamic stress-strain curves stiffen as the strain rate increases. The stiffening is lowest in the longitudinal case and highest in the transverse and shear cases. Unidirectional and crossply specimens with fiber waviness were fabricated and tested. It is shown that, with severe fiber waviness, strong nonlinearity occurs in the stress-strain curves due to fiber waviness with significant stiffening as the strain rate increases.",

Evaluation of the shielding performance of fabric-reinforced composites poses a great challenge when considering the local feature of fiber compression and damage under shock loading. A momentum diagnostic approach is developed in this paper to quantitatively determine the characteristics of momentum distribution of a debris cloud, which lays the basis for assessing a whipple shield. Efforts have been made to bring forward a systematic scheme for quantitative evaluation of a whipple shield. The bumper of a whipple is evaluated by measuring the spatial distribution of a debris cloud resulted from projectile/bumper collision. For a rear wall resisting discrete impacts of a debris cloud, two experimental schemes are applied consisting of micro fragments impact test to assess the material toughness against fragment penetrations, and planar impact test to evaluate the capability of energy absorption. Comprehensive tests were performed for fabric laminates and aluminum alloy coupons. It is evidenced that fabric laminates has the advantages of separating into fine fragments at collision speeds of 4-6km/s, and of reducing efficiently the shock intensity under a short shock pulse, not to mention its extremely high strength in nature. Hence, fabric laminates is of excellent selections both for a bumper and a rear wall. The experimental schemes being established afford a feasible way for optimization of a laminates combination. © 2013 The Authors.",

The fracture surfaces and microstructures of test samples were examined to understand the fatigue damage mechanisms of the composite. The composite revealed a high tensile strength and high fatigue resistance attributed to a damage tolerant behavior. The monotonic tensile strength was 1400-1500 MPa while the endurance limit with an R ratio of 0.1 was 750 MPa. The fatigue damage mode was strongly dependent on applied stresses. At high stresses, the fatigue life was controlled essentially by the initiation and growth of a single crack, and the composite behaved in a damage-intolerant manner. At low stresses, the fatigue life was mainly controlled by the initiation and growth of longitudinal surface splitting. This lead to damage-tolerant behavior. At intermediate stress levels, a transformation in fatigue damage mode could evolve from the surface splitting and distributed matrix cracking to the growth of a single matrix crack. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

T-laminates included a core obtained by multiple layers of jute between two E-glass fibre reinforced skins, whilst in Q-laminates single layers of jute fibres were intercalated at different levels between E-glass fibre reinforced layers. All laminates were impacted at five levels of energy, from 5 to 15 J, and then subjected to post-impact flexural tests. The results suggest that T hybrids perform better at low impact energies (up to 10 J), which do not damage significantly the laminate core. In contrast, Q hybrids are better suited to withstand extensive damage produced by higher impact energies (12.5 and 15 J), in that they allow a more effective redistribution of impact damage in the structure. This was confirmed by acoustic emission (AE) monitoring during flexural loading, which offered indications on the maximum stress laminates can undergo after impact damage.

Six identical wall specimens of size 1.83 m ?? 1.83 m were used; four of them were externally retrofitted using different composite retrofitting schemes and one was repaired with composite laminates after having diagonal cracks on wall faces. All specimens were tested under in-plane cyclic shear in presence of constant gravity load. Wall response with the gradual increase in lateral loading was recorded in the form of hysteretic load deflection curves from which wall ductility under cyclic loading is computed. During experiment, the damage progression in wall specimens and their ultimate failure modes were recorded. From these observations, the enhancement in ultimate in-plane shear capacity and wall ductility are calculated by comparing the response of retrofitted and non-retrofitted walls. A significant enhancement in wall ultimate capacity is observed due to the application of fiber reinforced polymer composite laminates. Experiment showed that the ultimate failure modes of the walls shifted from brittle to ductile nature when they were externally retrofitted with fiber reinforced polymer composites. Furthermore, the in-plane shear capacities of the same wall specimens are calculated using currently available code-based and research-based analytical models. Four such analytical models are used according to their applicability for different retrofitting schemes. The comparison of analytical result with experimental observations indicated that analytical models are very case specific and their applications are very restrictive. Thus further study is required to develop analytical models that will be generally applicable to a higher population of concrete masonry walls externally retrofitted with different combinations of composite materials and lamination schemes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The assumption of a rigid shift between the laminates was used to correlate load and displacement curves in the different phases of the load cycle. The hysteretic behaviour was attributed to friction phenomena and interpreted using damping coefficients characterizing the global dynamic response of the structural joint.",

The uncertainty in composite materials response is largely due to variability in the initiation and propagation of damage. To develop new tools for design with composite materials, techniques for identifying damage modes during operation are needed. While there is a large body of work on analysis of acoustic emission (AE) from different materials and different loading cases, the current research is focused on applying unsupervised learning for separating AE into a maximum number of groups with distinct evolution. AE data was collected during tensile and bending experiments on carbon fiber reinforced epoxy specimens with different material configurations. The unsupervised learning algorithms successfully identified AE groups with distinct initiation and evolution. With damage mechanisms inferred from load response and from deformation fields obtained with digital image correlation (DIC), strong correlations between the behaviors of the groups and the damage mechanisms were observed and are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) usage in the aerospace industry has been steadily increasing due to its superior material properties such as high strength, low weight, high resistance to corrosion, and a low thermal expansion coefficient. In addition, CFRP parts are produced near-net-shape, a process that eliminates rough machining operations. However, machining operations such as drilling, side milling, and slotting are still necessary to give the CFRP parts their final shape. A majority of the studies on machining of CFRP laminates are on drilling. The number of studies on milling of CFRPs is quite limited. In this study, a mechanistic cutting force model for milling CFRPs is proposed based on experimentally collected cutting force data during slot milling of unidirectional CFRP laminates using a polycrystalline diamond cutter. Cutting force coefficients in radial and tangential directions are calculated as a function of fiber cutting angle. The mechanistic model is shown to be capable of predicting cutting forces during milling of multidirectional CFRP laminates and capable of investigating stability of machining. ?? 2012 The Authors.",

          "abstract": "Transverse and shear damage in the polymer matrix of fiber reinforced composites are often treated independently, while the associated cracks are similar in appearance and effect. Matrix damage is often quantified by its crack density. However, damage also can be presented as a state variable. The definition of damage state variables and their evolution laws are the foundation of continuum damage mechanics, yet experimental data for shear damage evolution is limited. The effect of crack closure on the transverse stiffness of laminates was already incorporated in the damage models. However, the shear modulus sensitivity to crack closure has received little attention due to the complicated constitutive equations. This paper focused on the in-plane shear modulus reduction due to matrix transverse cracks and the evolution of transverse and shear damage. The comparison of existing models with experimental data showed that shear damage is currently not suitably described. Accordingly, a shear damage evolution model was proposed that included the effect of internal traction and crack closure on the in-plane shear modulus. The numerical predictions of the modified shear model resulted in good agreement with experimental data by predicting the same saturation crack density, axial and shear responses.",

The damage pattern is optimized as an inverse problem based on the above analyses while the spectrum shape is adopted as the objective function. The damage pattern is expressed by the residual strength distribution of the cohesive elements in the estimation scheme.

Methods: Standard preparations on canines (N = 50, 10 per group) were made using a depth cutting bur (0.7 mm depth) designed for laminate veneer restorations. Forty indirect laminates using a highly filled polymeric material (Estenia) and 10 direct laminates (Quadrant Anterior Shine) were prepared according to the manufacturer&#039;s instructions. Bidirectional E-glass woven-fiber sheet (0.06 mm) (Everstick) was applied at different locations at the cementation interface. The control group received no fibers. The specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 1 month prior to fracture testing performed in a universal testing machine where the load was applied from the incisal direction at 137° (1 mm/min). Results: No significant differences were found between the five groups (P &gt; 0.01) (one-way ANOVA). While indirect laminate veneers showed mean fracture strength of 247 ± 47 N, direct laminate veneers revealed 239 ± 104 N. The use of E-glass fibers at the cementation interface at different locations did not increase the fracture strength significantly (286-313 N) (P &gt; 0.01). Failure analysis showed mainly cohesive fracture of the veneer restoration (20/50) and adhesive failure between the cementation interface and the laminate with fiber exposure (19/50) covering more than half of the restorations. Significance: Direct and indirect resin composite laminate veneers showed comparable mean fracture strengths. The use of E-glass woven-fiber sheet at the cementation interface did not increase the fracture strength of the polymeric laminate veneers. © 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.",

It has been found that load drop point in load - displacement curve corresponds to damage onset in the plate. As for the CFRP plate the micro-buckling of the carbon fiber in 0 degrees layer (fiber kinking) occurs first and then matrix shear cracking in adjacent layers induced by the kinking follows. The propagation of the matrix shear cracking, on the other hand, is found to be prevented by the titanium films in the hybrid laminates. With the titanium films inserted to form sandwich with inner 0 degrees layer lower damage level is presented compared to the plate with the outer 0 degrees layers are sandwiched by the films since the shear matrix cracking propagates from inside toward surface.",

In reality, the aircraft parts made of composites were subjected to in-plane stresses during flight. In this study, an investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effect of in-plane stresses on the impact behavior of composite laminates. The low velocity drop-weight impact was conducted on T-300/976 quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy laminates. Impacted composite specimens were examined by C-scanning ultrasonic inspection to quantify the damage size. The contact force during impact was measured with a piezoelectric force transducer and a digital oscilloscope. The experimental results showed that the impact behavior was highly related to both pretension and precompression. Moreover, the pretension may induce the severe effect for impacted composite laminates.",

A composite plate is monitored for damage resulting from a low-velocity impact. The plate is excited simultaneously with two harmonic signals: a slow amplitude-modulated vibration pumping wave and a constant amplitude-probing wave. The frequency of both the excitation signals coincides with the resonances of the plate. An electromagnetic shaker is used to introduce the pumping wave to the plate. Two surface-bonded, low-profile piezoceramic transducers are used for probing-wave excitation and measurement. The wave modulation is transferred from the pumping wave to the probing wave in the presence of impact damage. This effect is exhibited in a power spectrum of the probing wave by a pattern of sidebands around the carrier harmonic. The results show that the amplitude of the sidebands is related to the severity of damage. The study also investigates also the effect of boundary conditions on the results.",

          "abstract": "Modeling progressive damage in composite materials and structures poses considerable challenges because damage is, in general, complex and involves multiple modes such as delamination, transverse cracking, fiber breakage, fiber pullout, etc. Clearly, damage in composites can be investigated at different length scales, ranging from the micromechanical to the macromechanical specimen and structural scales. In this article, a simple but novel finite-element-based method for modeling progressive damage in fiber-reinforced composites is presented. The element-failure method (EFM) is based on the simple idea that the nodal forces of an element of a damaged composite material can be modified to reflect the general state of damage and loading. This has an advantage over the usual material property degradation approaches, i.e., because the stiffness matrix of the element is not changed, computational convergence is theoretically guaranteed, resulting in a robust modeling tool. The EFM, when employed with suitable micromechanics-based failure criteria, may be a practical method for mapping damage initiation and propagation in composite structures. In this article, we present a micromechanical analysis for a new failure criterion called the strain invariant failure theory and the application of the EFM in the modeling of open-hole tension specimens. The micromechanical analysis yields a set of amplification factors, which are used to establish a set of micromechanically enhanced strain invariants for the failure criterion. The effects of material properties and volume fraction on the amplification factors are discussed.",

          "abstract": "It is now well known that Fick&#039;s Law is frequently inadequate for describing moisture diffusion in polymers and polymer composites. Non-Fickian or anomalous diffusion is likely to occur when a polymer composite laminate is subjected to external stresses that could give rise to internal damage in the form of matrix cracks. As a result, it is necessary to take into account the combined effects of temperature, stress (or strain), and damage in the construction of such a model. In this paper, a modeling methodology based on irreversible thermodynamics applied within the framework of composite macro-mechanics is extended to the case of a bi-axially damaged laminate. The model allows characterization of non-Fickian diffusion coefficients as well as moisture saturation level from moisture weight gain data for laminates with pre-existing and non-evolving damage. A symmetric damage tensor based on continuum damage mechanics is incorporated in this model by invoking the principle of invariance with respect to coordinate transformations. For tractability, the diffusion governing equations are simplified for the special case of a laminate with bi-axially oriented matrix cracks that is subjected to a uniaxial tensile stress. The final equations obtained from this derivation indicate that both effective diffusivity and maximum saturation level for this particular case can be expressed as quadratic functions of crack density. Comparisons with test data for a bi-axially damaged AS4/PR500 graphite/epoxy woven composite are provided for model verifications. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The curves of impact energy verse dent depth and impact energy verse the damage area was obtained. And the residual compressive strength and stiffness after impact verse damage parameters were analyzed. The results showed that when the impact energy exceeded the inflection point, as the impact energy increased, the dent depth on the impacted surface of the laminates notably increased while the damage area of the internal layers merely increased slowly. If the impact energy was continued to increase, the expansion of the laminates&#039; internal damage mainly consisted of fiber breaks. The main reason for the decrease in compressive performance of composite laminates was inside delamination between layers, while in the case in which impact energy exceeded the inflection point, there were no obvious changes in delamination damage area for different energy, so the residual compressive performance kept almost stable. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

          "abstract": "Present study focuses on the diffuse damage, its possible direction of growth and eventually its effect in the growth of matrix cracking. A detailed homogenization based micro- mechanics is used to study the local stress fields at the crack front of diffuse damage in unit cell RVE (representative volume element). Based on the state of this stress field, macro stresses which are responsible for the growth of diffuse damage along the circumference and away from circumference of fiber will be predicted. Study will focus on the coupling effect of three damages i.e fiber breakage, diffuse damage, matrix cracking. Based on these studies a continuum mechanics based (meso) damage model, developed by previous studies, has been improved by incorporating the coupling effect of these damages. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

It was found that the flow rate of resin continuously decreased as nanoclay content continuously increased. The reduction in the flow rate was attributed to the rate of change of curing and the subsequent change in viscosity of the nanoclay filled resin. Analysis of infusion process by Darcy&#039;s law show that the permeability of the fiber decreased in the nanoclay filled resin system.

A critical appraisal of a large amount of published mechanical property data reveals that stitching usually reduces the stiffness, strength and fatigue resistance of a laminate by not more than 1020%, although in a few cases the properties remain unchanged or increase slightly. This range of changes is observed for loading in compression, tension, bending or shear. Softening and strengthening mechanisms are proposed to account for the changes in properties due to stitching. Areas of research that are needed to further the understanding of the relationships between mechanisms and properties are identified.

The implemented model, which involves damage in both the meso-scale layer and an interface between the layers, is applied in a study of damage growth in finite-width angle-ply coupons and a composite panel with a terminated stiffener. The definition and evolution of state-dependent variables for layer damage is accomplished by means of a user-defined subroutine and the damageable interface is accomplished by using a user-defined element. It is demonstrated that as the fiber orientation progresses from 10 to 45??, the mode of damage changes from interlaminar damage, (i.e. delamination) to intralaminar damage, consistent with experimental observations. Analysis of damage development in the composite panel subjected to uniform compression shows that interlaminar shear stresses produce delamination at the skin-stiffener interface before failure of the panel due to tensile fiber rupture,-again consistent with experimental observations. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

After validation, the model is used to assess the effects of stacking sequence and clamping pressure on the delamination onset loads and surfaces. It is concluded that &quot;blocked&quot; laminates lead to lower delamination onset loads and larger initial delaminated regions. Finger-tight and clamped joints have higher delamination onset loads and smaller initial cracked regions than pin-loaded joints. These results are in agreement with experimental observations, but no significant difference is detected between finger-tight and clamped joints.

          "abstract": "The bending toughness, strength retention, resistance to damage and bending stiffness of glass fiber mat, laminar composites under high strain rate impact loading conditions was studied. One of the main disadvantages of laminar composite materials is their poor interlaminar shear strength. Recent work has demonstrated a method of Z-direction reinforcement of these composites using electrostatic flocking techniques improve delamination resistance and fracture toughness without degrading the composite&#039;s tensile strength or other in-plane properties when loaded quasistatically. The Z-direction reinforcement is accomplished by electrostatically flocking short fibers perpendicular to and between the composite ply layers. In this study, composite samples were prepared using the flocking method in two fabrication modes by the; so-called Z-Axis &quot;wet&quot; and ZAxis &quot;dry&quot; procedures. In this work, Z-direction reinforced composite panels (including a non reinforced control) that were previously projectile impact damaged were tested using established mechanical testing procedures. Damage areas were quantified and compared using image processing techniques. Three point bending tests were also conducted on these projectile impact damaged panels to determine and compare their bending toughness, strength retention and modulus. The results show that Z-Axis reinforcement by the flocking technique improves the overall mechanical strength and stiffness properties of glass fiber mat laminar composites. For example, ZAxis reinforced projectile damaged and not damaged glass fiber mat composite laminates are found to have flexural strengths 9% to 15% higher and a flexural modulus (stiffness) 22% to 26% higher than comparable (not Z-Axis flock reinforced) glass fiber mat samples. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.",

Second, the post-damage softening response is controlled by a linear form damage evolution law combined with the fracture energy approach. Stiffness progressive reduction is characterized by a variable determined by equivalent displacement for each failure mode and in doing so the mesh dependency can be reduced appreciably. Third, strain rate dependency of the strength and the modulus of FRP laminated materials are also considered. Comparisons are made between the present numerical results and some available test data.

          "abstract": "The present paper discusses the results of an investigation into the effects of test rate and the mode of loading on the fracture energy, G c, of adhesively-bonded fibre-composite joints. Various carbon-fibre reinforced-polymer (CFRP) matrix composite substrates have been bonded using two different types of automotive structural epoxy-adhesives. They have been tested via loading the bonded joints in mode I (tensile), mode II (in-plane shear) and mixed-mode I/II from slow rates (i.e.; of about 10 -5 m/s) up to relatively high rates of test of about 15 m/s. The high-rate tests were photographed using a high-speed digital video camera to record the deformation of the joint and the fracture behaviour. An analysis strategy has been developed for the various modes of loading (i) to account for the observed fracture behaviour, (ii) to circumvent the problems posed by oscillations in the load traces due to the presence of dynamic effects in the faster tests, and (iii) to account for the kinetic energy associated with the moving specimen arms in the faster tests. Based on the analysis strategy developed, the effect of the test rate on the fracture energy, G c, for the different loading modes for the joints has been ascertained. Furthermore, various different fracture paths were observed in the tests. They were either cohesive, in the adhesive layer, or interlaminar in the composite substrates. The exact fracture path observed was a function of (i) the type of composite substrate, (ii) the type of adhesive, and (iii) the mode of loading employed. However, the nature of the fracture path was found to be quite insensitive to the test rate. Essentially, it was found that joints subjected to mixed-mode I/II loading were more likely to exhibit an interlaminar fracture path in the composite substrates than when loaded in either pure modes I or II. The propensity for a given joint to exhibit such a fracture path via delamination of the composite substrate has been explained by calculating the transverse tensile stresses induced in the loaded composite arms, and comparing this value to the measured transverse tensile strength of the composite. Following this approach, the underlying reasons for the observed fracture path were identified and could be predicted. Also, the proposed scheme provides a route to design against delamination failure occurring in adhesively-bonded fibre-composite test specimens. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "This work deals with the issue of damage growth in thin woven composite laminates subjected to tensile loading. The conducted tensile tests were monitored on-line with an infrared camera, and tested specimens were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Combined with SEM micrographs, observation of heat source fields enabled us to assess the damage sequence. Transverse weft cracking was confirmed to be the main damage mode and fiber breakage was the final damage leading to failure. For cracks which induce little variation of specimen stiffness, the classic &quot;Compliance method&quot; could not be used to compute energy release rate. Hence, we present here a new procedure based on the estimation of heat source fields to calculate the energy release rate associated with transverse weft cracking. The results are then compared to those computed with a simple 3D inverse model of the heat diffusion problem and those presented in the literature. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Presently, due to the energy saving concerns, there is an increase demand for lightweight structures for transportation industry, electric power wind generators among others. In this context design and maintenance of these civil engineering structures has put a stress on durability issues. The time scale for aeronautical applications is different for the rest of civil engineering structural applications therefore the durability experience accumulated on aeronautics is of little use. Usually civil engineering structures must remain in service for 50 years or more. Therefore the needs for real long-term mechanical performance prediction become quite important. Presently, for instance, the standards for buried GRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites) pipes demand more than 10,000h of creep tests in order to extrapolate data for two decades (in the time log scale) with a high level of confidence. The accelerated methodology proposed by Miyano et al. [Miyano Y, Nakada M, Sekine N. Accelerated testing for long-term durability of FRP laminates for marine use. J Composite Mater 2005;39:5–20] on Carbon and Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP and GFRP) laminates, rests on the fact that the time-superposition principle is the same for static, creep and fatigue strengths. Although not universally verified, it has been used successfully to predict fatigue lifetimes of many typical composites. In this context time-dependent failure criteria for viscoelastic materials is reviewed. Comparison between creep failure and static failure under constant stress/strain rate tests are analyzed. Cumulative damage laws, including the classical Linear Cumulative Damage law (LCD), are introduced to enlighten these comparisons. Finally some applications to lifetime prediction under variable amplitude fatigue loading are presented. The empirical LCD law performance is compared against the other physical based cumulative damage laws using fatigue loading sequences invented to expose the incoherencies of LCD lifetime predictions.",

A 30% fiber loading exhibited the best tensile strength, while modulus increased with increase of fiber content, and strain deteriorated with increase of fiber content. Flexural strength and modulus increased with increase of fiber loading. Increase of fiber loading resulted in decline in impact strength. Hardness increased by addition of 30% fiber content.

          "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate theoretically the possible development of instabilities in fiber-reinforced elastomers (and other soft materials) when they are subjected to finite-strain loading conditions. We focus on the physically relevant class of &quot;macroscopic&quot; instabilities, i.e., instabilities with wavelengths that are much larger than the characteristic size of the underlying microstructure. To this end, we make use of recently developed homogenization estimates, together with a fundamental result of Geymonat, Müller and Triantafyllidis linking the development of these instabilities to the loss of strong ellipticity of the homogenized constitutive relations. For the important class of material systems with very stiff fibers and random microstructures, we derive a closed-form formula for the critical macroscopic deformation at which instabilities may develop under general loading conditions, and we show that this critical deformation is quite sensitive to the loading orientation relative to the fiber direction. The result is also confronted with classical estimates (including those of Rosen) for laminates, which have commonly been used as two-dimensional (2-D) approximations for actual fiber-reinforced composites. We find that while predictions based on laminate models are qualitatively correct for certain loadings, they can be significantly off for other more general 3-D loadings. Finally, we provide a parametric analysis of the effects of the matrix and fiber properties and of the fiber volume fraction on the onset of instabilities for various loading conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The emphasis is on the generation and evolution of the curing induced residual stress/strain and their influence on the response under subsequent mechanical loading. The cross-ply laminate is modeled by a representative volume element and the constituent materials are described by an elastic model for the fiber and a non-linear viscoelastic model for the polymer matrix. The residual stress/strain fields at the ambient temperature immediately following the cool-down and their evolution with time are determined through the viscoelastic finite element discretization of the RVE with a special consideration given to the fiber/matrix interface region. The results indicate that the residual stresses decrease with time and tend to small asymptotic values after about 34 h. However, the remaining residual strains still have significant influence on the damage evolution of the cross-ply laminate under subsequently superimposed tensile loading.

The surface treatments were evaluated by contact angle, roughness and scanning electron microscopy techniques. In order to compare different families of fiber composite/metal laminates, carbon fiber and glass fiber fabrics were used as reinforcements for the hybrid laminates. The adhesion of the hybrid laminates was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and three-point bending test. CAA resulted in better wetting properties.

Various failure criteria and modelling techniques using both shell and solid finite elements are investigated and good correlation has been obtained with test observations. The effects of discretizing the woven roving layers to unidirectional layers to model matrix cracking are reported. The inclusion of resin rich layers between laminated plies that act as delamination layers in the present model has improved the correlation with test data and their detrimental effects have been discussed.

Material response and micro-scale damage mechanism of cross-ply, [0/90]ns, and angle-ply, [??45] ns, glass-fibre/epoxy laminates were captured using multi-scale modelling via computational micromechanics. The framework of the homogenization theory for periodic media was used for the analysis of the proposed &#039;multi-fibre multi-layer representative volume element&#039; (M2RVE). Each layer in M2RVE was represented by a unit cube with multiple randomly distributed, but longitudinally aligned, fibres of equal diameter and with a volume fraction corresponding to that of each lamina (equal in the present case). Periodic boundary conditions were applied to all the faces of the M 2RVE. The non-homogeneous stress-strain fields within the M 2RVE were related to the average stresses and strains by using Gauss&#039; theorem in conjunction with the Hill-Mandal strain energy equivalence principle. The global material response predicted by the M2RVE was found to be in good agreement with experimental results for both laminates. The model was used to study effect of matrix friction angle and cohesive strength of the fibre-matrix interface on the global material response.

The specimens with dog bone shape were cut from the original plates having 3 mm thickness and fiber weight fraction of 0.66. Static tests were performed in order to study the influence of delamination size on the laminate stiffness and strength. Complementary finite element analysis was carried out showing the influence of angular misalignments of fiber/matrix delaminations on the laminate stiffness. Fatigue tests were performed in load control for R = 0.05 and R = --1, with a loading frequency of 10 Hz, at room temperature.

Twenty-two [??45]2s laid-up specimens each were tested at 5, 50 and 500 (mm/min) crosshead displacement rates, using a universal testing machine. The longitudinal and transverse strains were obtained experimentally using contacting extensometry apparatus and then transformed to the ply axis using Classical Laminate Theory. A rigourous statistical treatment method was proposed for the processing and analysis of the raw data. The shear modulus decreased for increasing strain rate. The shear failure stress increased for increasing strain rate. Semi-empirical linear functions of the shear modulus and shear failure strength were proposed with respect to the logarithm of the shear strain rate. The shear failure strain was independent of strain rate. Finally, the observed opposing trends of in-plane shear modulus and shear failure stress suggested that shear damage evolution is strain rate dependent for the examined material. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "High-velocity transverse impact of laminated fiber reinforced composites is of interest in military, marine and structural applications. The overall objective of this work was to investigate the behavior of laminated thermoplastic composites of varying thicknesses under high-velocity impact from an experimental and modeling viewpoint. In order to analyze this problem, a series of ballistic impact tests have been performed on plain weave E-glass/polypropylene (E-glass/PP) composites of different thicknesses using 0.30 and 0.50 caliber right-cylinder shaped projectiles. A gas gun with a sabot stripper mechanism was employed to impact the panels. In order to analyze the perforation mechanisms, ballistic limit and damage evaluation, an explicit three-dimensional finite element code LS-DYNA was used. Material model 162, a progressive failure model based on modified Hashin&#039;s criteria, has been assigned to analyze failure of the laminate. The projectile was modeled using Material model 3 (MAT_PLASTIC_KINEMATIC). The laminates and the projectile were meshed using brick elements with single integration points. The impact velocity ranged from 187 to 332 m s-1. Good agreement between the numerical and experimental results was attained in terms of predicting ballistic limit, delamination and energy absorption of E-glass/PP laminate. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

A spray coating technique has been utilized as an effective way to deposit carbon nanotubes (CNTs) onto carbon fibre prepregs with good control of network formation and the potential for localization. Compared to more traditional approaches of introducing CNTs into epoxy matrices for enhancing composite properties, this technique has benefits in terms of its simplicity and versatility, as well as the potential for industrial scale-up. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated by the extremely low CNT loading (0.047 wt.%) needed to significantly increase the Mode-I fracture toughness of the carbon fibre laminates by about 50%, which is so far the largest reported improvement for such extremely low concentrations of non-functionalized CNTs. In-situ damage sensing has also been presented for the monitoring of structural health of these nano-engineered composite laminates upon loading, and a systematic analysis of sensing signals is performed.",

Five samples with different numbers of carbonization and heat-treatment cycles were considered; all had the same 8 harness-fiber-weave architecture and 0 ?? 0 ?? layup. Compressive strengths ranging from 130 to 270 MPa were obtained. All samples failed through the formation of a diagonal shear fault across the laminate which, on the local scale, consisted of bundle kinks (at crimps) interspersed with interply delaminations. Failure mechanisms under both interlaminar and in-plane shear loading were also determined for all the samples by using a direct shear setup. Interlaminar shear strengths (ILSS) ranged from 5 to 8 MPa, and in-plane shear strengths were in the range of 15 to 28 MPa. The failure under ILSS loading was through the formation of a planar shear fault following the crimp boundaries, whereas under in-plane shear, the failure was through interply delaminations on sample faces normal to the plies. ?? 1995.",

Classical lamination theory is taken as basis for the formulation. A new degradation model based on Tsai-Hill terms is developed and used with analytical formulation to assess the progressive failure. Appropriate features are incorporated in the model to distinguish the matrix failure, the fiber matrix debonding, the fiber failure, and the failure of the isotropic layer. The formulation is used to predict the failure behavior of a FML under in-plane off-axis loading. Different strengths associated with the failure of the laminate like stress at first ply failure and yielding of isotropic layer are investigated. The results show that the new degradation model facilitated the detailed estimation of failure progression. These values of predicted strength are more accurate and closer to the actual experimental results than that of the values predicted by any other model.",

An investigation is performed on the reduction of stiffness and the heat generated during the progression of damage. It is shown that even in the matrix mode failure the fatigue limit can be above the monotonic damage criterion, where the composite losses its rigidity either due to plasticity or matrix fiber separation.

The IR signal from the surface of open-hole S2-glass/E733FR laminates is captured concurrently during constant amplitude fatigue loadings. The IR testing has high thermal sensitivity below 10mK and the image integration is synchronized with the mechanical loading. A thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) technique using thermomechanics is used to process the IR fields and relate them to surface stresses and strains. Damage metric is developed for the composite samples based on an area stress reduction threshold. The applicability and validity of the proposed TSA damage index is evaluated by comparing it to the classical overall stiffness reduction measured at select fatigue intervals using an extensometer. The IR-TSA damage index at the last fatigue cycle is used to calibrate the Markov chain models (MCMs). The damage predictions of the MCMs are then examined at different fatigue cycles. A new method is proposed to construct a stochastic S–N curve utilizing the MCMs. The proposed IR-TSA with Markov stochastics is shown to be very effective in predicting the damage evolution and allowed constructing a wide-range of stochastic S–N curves for several composite material systems including experimental results from the literature.",

The intrinsic properties of the components, morphology of the system and the nature of interface between the phases determine the dynamic mechanical properties of the composite. At lower temperatures (in the glassy region), the E??? values are maximum for the neat polyester whereas at temperatures above Tg, the E??? values are found to be maximum for composites with 40% fiber loading, indicating that the incorporation of banana fiber in polyester matrix induces reinforcing effects appreciably at higher temperatures. The loss modulus and damping peaks were found to be lowered by the incorporation of fiber. The height of the damping peaks depended on the fiber content. When higher .ber content of 40% was used, an additional peak in the tan ?? curve, pointing to micro mechanical transitions due to the immobilized polymer layer was evident. The glass transition temperature associated with the damping peak was lowered up to a fiber content of 30???. The Tg values were increased with higher fiber content. Cole-Cole analysis was made to understand the phase behavior of the composite samples. A master curve was constructed based on time-temperature super position principle, which allows the prediction of long-term effects. Apparent activation energy of the relaxation process of the composites was also analyzed. The value was found to be maximum for composites with 40% fiber content. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "The aim of this study is to characterize and compare damage processes in carbon/epoxy laminates submitted to either isothermal ageing or thermal cycling in neutral (vacuum or nitrogen) and oxidative (air) atmospheres. During a thermal cycling test performed in an oxidative atmosphere like air, there is a coupling effect between matrix oxidation, occurring at the highest temperatures of the cycle, and matrix cracking due to thermo-mechanical ply stresses induced by the prevented differential expansions of the plies. In order to separate those two damage mechanisms, a model of oxidation is used to determine the experimental conditions of an isothermal test &#039;equivalent&#039; to a thermal cycling one, in terms of mass loss due to oxidation. After having checked this equivalence, a quantitative analysis of the damages induced by the two types of tests, is carried out. It is shown that the oxidation of a laminate in isothermal conditions results in damages, which concern only the skin of the sample. On the contrary, the coupling of such damage mechanisms with cyclic stresses in thermal cycling accelerates the damage processes and especially the matrix crack propagation from the surfaces to the core of the laminate. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Ballistic limit (BL) for each composite has been estimated through correlation of SV and residual velocity (RV) of the projectile by usual V50 method. Ballistic limit was found to vary linearly with composite laminate thickness. Twaron1-PP composites exhibited higher ballistic limit compared to equivalent thickness of Twaron1-epoxy composites. Epoxy-based composites exhibited localized damage mode compared to a global mode of failure in PP-based composites. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that fibers in Twaron1-epoxy composites failed largely by shear while tensile mode of failure was observed for Twaron1–PP composites.",

Tsai-Hill failure criterion was applied to identify the critical areas of failure in composite laminates. In accordance with the 3D FEA, unidirectional ([0]16), cross-ply ([0/90]4s) and angle-ply ([??45]4s) laminates made up of pre-preg Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) composites were manufactured and tested under three-point bending. The basic principles of Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) were extended to three-dimension, and the analytical solution was critically compared with the FEA results. The 3D FEA results revealed significant transverse normal stresses in the cross-ply laminate and in-plane shear stress in the angle-ply laminate near free edge regions which are overlooked by conventional laminate model. The microscopic images showed that these free edge effects were the main reason for stiffness reduction observed in the bending tests. The study illustrated the significant effects of fibre lay-up on the flexural failure mechanisms in composite laminates which lead to some suggestions to improve the design of composite laminates.",

The present study investigates the dependence of this property on the distribution of fibers in the cross-section of a unidirectional composite. The approach taken is to consider actual distributions, which are arbitrary and are not necessarily described by random or periodic distributions. A fundamental issue in studying non-uniform distributions is the size of a representative volume element (RVE). By the use of an actual radial distribution function obtained for a ceramic-matrix composite by quantitative stereology in conjunction with a simulation technique developed in this study, the RVE size is investigated with respect to initiation of debonding and radial matrix cracking - two basic mechanisms governing the transverse strength of composites. Tensile loading transverse to the fibers and residual stresses induced by thermal cooldown are considered separately as loading modes for transverse failure. The results provide some useful insight into the importance of non-uniformity of fiber spatial distribution with regard to the transverse failure of composites.",

The CA fatigue and two-block fatigue tests were performed on unnotched laminates having two dierent lay-ups: [0/45/90]S3 and [0/45/90]S4. The thinner lay-up was tested in T±T fatigue, and the thicker lay-up in T±C fatigue to preclude buckling. Load levels of 20±50% of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) were used for CA T±T fatigue tests while 20 and 30% UTS were used for CA T±C fatigue tests. Load mixes of 20/40% and 30/40% UTS were used for T±T block loading while 20/30% UTS mix was used for T±C fatigue. The ply crack densities were measured by using the edge-replication technique. The block order was changed to assess the load sequence eect. The ply cracking in T±C fatigue was much more severe than in T± T fatigue even when the maximum tensile stress was kept the same. In both T±T and T±C, low/high sequence resulted in a higher crack densities than high/low sequence. The crack-density data from constant-ampli- tude T±T fatigue were used in conjunction with a stiness reduction scheme to establish in situ S±N (stress±life) curves for the 90 and ÿ45 plies. The S±N curves were further condensed into a master S±N curve by the use of a polynomial failure function. A cumulative damage model was then established under the assumption that the stress redistribution during ply cracking takes place in such a way that the failure function remains on the master S±N curve. The cumulative damage model was applied to pre- dict ply cracking under block fatigue, under T±C fatigue, and also under T±T fatigue in two cross-ply laminates. A concept of equivalent root-mean-square power was used to relate the damage under T±T fatigue to that under T±C fatigue. In general, the cumulative damage model was shown to provide reasonable estimates of crack densities under the test conditions studied.",

A generalized energetic-statistical size effect law recently developed on the basis of a probabilistic nonlocal theory is introduced. This law represents asymptotic matching of three limits: (1) the power-law size effect of the classical Weibull theory, approached for infinite structure size; (2) the deterministic-energetic size effect law based on the deterministic nonlocal theory, approached for vanishing structure size; and (3) approach to the same law at any structure size when the Weibull modulus tends to infinity. The limited test data that exist are used to verify this formula and examine the closeness of fit. The results show that the new energetic-statistical size effect theory can match the existing flexural strength data better than the classical statistical Weibull theory, and that the optimum size effect fits with Weibull theory are incompatible with a realistic coefficient of variation of scatter in strength tests of various types of laminates. As for the energetic-statistical theory, its support remains entirely theoretical because the existing test data do not reveal any improvement of fit over its special case, the purely energetic theory probably because the size range of the data is not broad enough or the scatter is too high, or both.",

          "abstract": "The global behavior of composite materials is strongly influenced by the quality of adhesion between different components. A component can be single phase, like fibers or particles used as reinforcement in a homogenous matrix, or a multiphase material like a layer in long-fiber laminate. In the latter case the degradation of adhesion implies the separation of the layers, known as delamination. Among all different failure mechanisms, &#039;Delamination&#039; is considered to be the most prominent mode of failure in fiber-reinforced laminates as a result of their relatively weak inter-laminar strength. When laminated structures are subjected to static, dynamic or cyclic loadings, the inter-laminar adhesion strength between individual plies tends to deteriorate significantly and act as the origin of the final failure. Therefore, an efficient and reliable design tool capable of predicting delamination could improve the durability for composite laminates. There exist damage mechanics based formulations capable of simulating the delamination crack growth in carbon/glass fiber epoxy based composite laminates. The present study is focused on taking a step forward in this respect. At first, already existed local interface model&#039;s effectiveness is tested and results are successfully compared with available experimental data for UD IMS/924 Carbon/fiber epoxy composite laminate. Next, a non-local integral-type regularization scheme is introduced to overcome the spurious localization problem associated to the existing local model. Basic concepts and mathematical modeling of Non-Local damage evolution law are comprehensively studied and presented in this study. Finite Element simulation results based on proposed model are discussed in detail and are compared with experimental results.",

In addition to the primary requirements of stiffness, strength, and ease of processing, wind blade materials must withstand severe fatigue loading under service environments. The large material volumes and cost constraints also lead to unusually thick plies and fabrics, as well as thick adhesive bonds, which, combined with relatively brittle, low cost resins, can exacerbate delamination related structural integrity issues found in most composites structures. Important differences in performance are shown for the major fiber and resin types of relevance to blades. Details of fabric construction, fiber content and ply drop and geometry can produce major differences in performance, particularly under fatigue loading. Materials and conditions are identified where particularly low strain damage failure can occur at high cycles.",

The effect of joint configuration, adhesive layer thickness, defects, humidity, spew fillet, and adherend stiffness were investigated by means of tension tests. Four joint configurations were considered: two configurations representing real aeronautical applications namely, the joggle lap joints (JLJ) and the L-section joints (LSJ) and two configurations representing the most popular standard joints namely, the single lap joint (SLJ) and the double strap joints (DSJ). The SLJ and DSJ show higher ultimate loads and displacements to failure than the JLJ and LSJ. The failure load and displacement were found to decrease dramatically when the adhesive layer thickness was increased or when the joint was aged in a hot-humid environment. Intentionally unbonded area in the middle of the joined area did not seem to affect the joint resistance. The investigation of the spew fillet and adherend stiffness for the JLJ showed that the spew fillet effect depended on both the adherend stiffness and the adhesive ductility. The fracture mechanisms were found to change dramatically. Finally, the effect of adherend stiffness was investigated for the JLJ configuration with adherend laminates having stacking sequences of (??45)n and (0/90)n. Most of the joints made from (0/90)n laminates failed at the adherend joggle knee and all the joints made from (??45)n laminates failed at the interface at lower load. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A micromechanics model which accounts for the transverse shear stress effect, the effect of strain rate dependency and the effect of inelasticity is used for analyzing the mechanical responses of the fiber and matrix constituents. The accuracy of the micromechanics model under transverse shear loading is verified by comparing the results with those obtained using a general purpose finite element code. A higher order laminated plate theory is extended to capture the inelastic deformations of the composite plate and is implemented using the finite element technique. A complete micro-macro numerical procedure is developed to model the strain rate dependent behavior of inelastic composite laminates by implementing the micromechanics model into the finite element model. Parametric studies of the transient responses of composite plates are conduced. The effects of geometry, ply stacking sequence, material models, boundary conditions and loadings are investigated. The results show that the strain rate dependency and inelasticity influence the transient responses of composite plates via two significantly different mechanisms. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Calculations were performed for two different laminates with various notch sizes under tensile loading, and the calculations were found to correlate well with experimental results.

A one-dimensional cure simulation analysis is coupled to an incremental laminated plate theory model to study the relationships between complex gradients in temperature and degree of cure, and process-induced residual stress and deformation during cure. Thermal expansion and cure shrinkage contribute to changes in material specific volume and represent important sources of internal loading included in the analysis. Temperature and degree of cure gradients that develop during the curing process represent fundamental mechanism that contribute to stress development not considered in traditional residual stress analysis of laminated composites. Model predictions of cure dependent epoxy modulus and curvature in unsymmetric graphite/epoxy laminates are correlated with experimental data. The effects of processing history (autoclave temperature cure cycle), laminate thickness, resin cure shrinkage and laminate stacking sequence on the evolution of process-induced stress and deformation in thick-section glass/polyester and graphite/epoxy laminates during cure are studied. The magnitude of process-induced residual stress is sufficient to initiate transverse crack and delaminations. The results clearly indicate that the mechanics and performance of thick-section thermoset laminates are strongly dependent on processing history.",

The accumulation of different damage modes has been assessed, as a function of number of cycles, using a three-dimensional fatigue progressive damage model (FPDM). The residual strength of the CFRP laminates has been assessed through the combined use of the FPDM with a static three-dimensional progressive damage model (PDM). By simulating the experimental procedure, the FPDM has been applied up to certain number of cycles, to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage and then, the static PDM has been applied (quasi-static tensile loading) to predict final tensile failure of the laminates, which corresponds to the residual strength of the laminate, after it has been exposed at the specific cycles. The models comprised the components of stress analysis performed using finite elements, failure analysis performed using polynomial stress-based failure criteria and material property degradation performed using degradation rules. The analysis has been validated experimentally (a) by assuming a laminate free of internal defects, and (b) by considering the initial defects, which were determined experimentally for certain laminates. The analysis has resulted in an accurate simulation of the experimentally determined fatigue damage accumulation and residual strength. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0°/90°] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies. Predictions of residual velocity, development of deformation and delamination correlate well with experimental results.",

In this research we utilize electrically conductive networks of carbon nanotubes as in situ sensors for detecting damage accumulation during cyclic loading of advanced fiber composites. Here we show that, by combining load and strain measurements in real-time with direct current electrical resistance measurements of the carbon nanotube network, insight can be gained toward the evolution and accumulation of damage.

          "abstract": "A new approach for modelling the post-fatigue strength and stiffness of notched fibre composite laminates has been developed. It is based on the observation of notch tip damage which can be quantified by the extent of the individual failure processes, splitting in the 0° plies and delamination between the 0° ply and off-axis plies. The notch tip damage zone grows stably under tensile cyclic loading in a self-similar manner and the size and shape of this damage zone is dependent on laminate geometry and constituent properties of the fibre, matrix and interface. The post-fatigue strength and stiffness of the laminate can be related uniquely to the split length, which defines the extent of damage growth. In this first paper in a series of four, observation is made and measurements taken of the damage growth mechanisms that make up the damage zone in carbon fibre/epoxy laminates. Radiographs are used to characterise the notch tip damage zone and to establish a qualitative relationship between post-fatigue strength (or stiffness), cyclic stress, damage size and numbers of cycles.",

          "abstract": "Composite structures are usually subjected to fluctuating loads in service leading to fatigue failure. Because it is one of the main failure modes, fatigue behavior of composites has been extensively studied to be able to design fatigue-resistant composite structures. However, little attention has been paid to their design optimization under fatigue loading. In this study, a methodology is proposed to find the optimum fiber orientation angles of composite laminates under various in-plane loads to achieve maximum fatigue life. Fawaz–Ellyin’s model is used to predict the fatigue life of the laminates. A variant of simulated annealing algorithm is used as the search algorithm in the optimization procedure. A number of problems are solved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Three testing methods for the bicycle frame, i.e. torsional, frontal, and vertical loadings, are adopted in the analysis. From the finite element results, the stacking sequences [0/90/90/0]s and [0/90/45/-45]s are the good designs for the composite bicycle frames. On the contrary, the uni-directional laminates, i.e. [0/0/0/0]s, [90/90/90/90]s, [45/45/45/45]s and [-45/-45/-45/-45]s, are the bad designs. In addition, weak regions of failure occur at the fillets and connections of the frame, i.e. the stress concentration regions. All weak points occur at the inner or outer layer of the laminated composite tube. The 0??-ply and 90??-ply located on the inner and outer layer of the tube can effectively resist the higher stress at its location. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The production of glass/plant fiber hybrid laminates is a possibility for obtaining semistructural materials with sufficient impact properties, and a better life cycle analysis (LCA) profile than fiberglass. The simplest and possibly the most effective configuration for the pro- duction of these hybrids would involve the use of a plant fiber reinforced laminate as the core between two glass fiber reinforced laminates. A main limitation to the use of composites including plant fibers is that their properties may be significantly affected by the presence of damage, so that even the application of a low stress level can result in laminate failure. In particular, it is suggested that when loading is repeatedly applied and removed, residual properties may vary in an unpredictable way. In this work, E-glass/jute hybrid reinforced laminates, impacted in a range of energies (10, 12.5, and 15 J), have been subjected to post-impact cyclic flexural tests with a step loading procedure. This would allow evaluating the effect of damage dissipation offered by the plant fiber reinforced core. The tests have also been monitored by acoustic emission (AE), which has confirmed the existence of severe limitations to the use of this hybrid material when impacted at energies close to penetration.",

Damage variables were introduced to represent the matrix crack, delamination and fiber breakage, respectively, and stiffness degradation criteria were proposed for different damage modes. A progressive damage analysis was conducted for composite laminates under quasi-static transverse compressive loading by using a strain-based Hashin and Yeh failure criterion as well as the finite element method. The damage resistance was predicted. The numerical analysis was implemented with a commercial finite element code, ABAQUS/standard, via its user subroutine UMAT. The numerical results indicate that the onset and propagation of the delamination induce a discontinuity in the slope of the force-displacement curve, and the fiber breakages are induced once the contact force reaches its maximum. The numerical results agree well with the test data for the delamination onset load and the maximum contact force.",

The preform materials used in this work, known under trademark 3Weave???, were manufactured by 3TEX using S-2 glass fiber roving. Four different preforms, having areal weights 93, 98, 100, and 190 oz/yd2, were used in fabrication of single-layer and two-layer composites. The respective composites were made using VARTM process with Dow Derakane epoxy/vinyl ester resin. A shock tube was used to create the shock loading for the study and was chosen for its ability to provide highly consistent and repeatable levels of shock loading. The material&#039;s resistance to shock loading was evaluated using such parameters as surface and internal visual damage, the magnitude of permanent (i.e., after-shock, residual) deflection, and post-mortem compressive strength. The observed visual damage consisted of surface discolorations at low shock load levels and progressed to surface fiber breakage accompanied by internal delaminations and breakage of the through thickness (Z-directional) fibers at higher shock load levels. The onset of permanent deflection in the form of bulging was observed in the panels tested at pressures of 5.65 MPa and higher with maximum values of 8-9 mm found in the 93 and 100 oz/yd2 preform composites tested at a pressure of 8.1 MPa. The compressive strength of the materials was also found to decrease in both the warp and weft fiber directions with increasing test pressures. Over the range of shock pressures applied in this series of tests, the 98 oz/yd2 preform composite was found to perform best in terms of a smaller amount of visual damage, lower permanent deflection, and higher post-mortem compressive strength. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, it is shown herein that the torsional stiffness is highly sensitive to the forms of damage that arise and evolve in the aforementioned composites under tension and appears to correlate very well with the extent of damage. Since the tensile failure scenarios under static and fatigue loads are similar to each other, the latter stiffness can serve as a sensitive parameter for predicting residual life.

Fractographic analysis revealed interfacial debonding as the dominant failure mechanism, indicating a strong influence of water degradation on fracture toughness results. Alterations in visco-elastic properties of glass/PEI composite which was exposed to hydrothermal aging were analyzed with the dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) method. DMTA tests give evidence of plasticization of the PEI matrix.",

          "abstract": "A new ultimate strength model is developed to predict the final fail- ure, with the influence of matrix failure, of notched cross-ply laminates. The present model is based on the estimation of the local stresses and the redistribution of the local stresses in the critical damage zones around the notches. The new ultimate strength model can be stated as: when the local stresses in the critical-load-carrying elements reach their failure strength, the critical-load-carrying element will fail and the ultimate failure will occur. In order to estimate the local stress concentration in the critical damage zones, a method is developed and applied to decompose the local stress concentration into several parts, e.g., the geometrical contribution, the stacking-ratio contribution, and the damage contribution. Combined with a single numerical simulation for a notched laminate, the damage-dependent stress concen- tration of the laminate can be established for different notches and it is then utilized to predict the ultimate strength of notched laminates with different notches. The applications of this method show that the model prediction agrees with the experi- mental observations satisfactorily",

The impact tests were conducted on samples without and with CSP particles into the ply interfaces. The loads versus time curves were examined to determine the impact response and the associated energy absorption by the laminates were studied. The results indicate that both, the peak load of the laminates improved by 41% and damping index (DI) reduced by 90% with the dispersion of 51 g/m2 of CSP particles within the prepreg ply interfaces of the laminates. It was noted that the CSP particles shielded the composites from the initial severity of impact. The energy absorbing mechanisms altered the supercritical response of the laminate to subcritical due to increase in the elastic energy stored within the laminates with CSP particles thereby changing the energy absorption modes. It was observed from macroscopic observations and SEM images of the damage sites that the damage mechanism and patterns changed and the extent of damage reduced with the addition of CSP particles.",

          "abstract": "Continuous fiber/metal laminates (FML) offer significant improvements over current available materials for aircraft structures due to their excellent fatigue endurance and low density. Glass fibers/epoxy laminae and aluminum foil (Glare) are commonly used to obtain these hybrid composites. The environmental factors can limit the applications of composites by deteriorating the mechanical properties during service. Usually, epoxy resins absorb moisture when exposed to humid environments and metals are prone to surface corrosion. Therefore, the combination of the two materials in Glare (polymeric composite and metal), can lead to differences that often turn out to be beneficial in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental influences. In this work, the viscoelastic properties, such as storage modulus (E???) and loss modulus (E???), were obtained for glass fiber/epoxy composite, aluminum 2024-T3 alloy and for a glass fiber/epoxy/aluminum laminate (Glare). It was found that the glass fiber/epoxy (G/E) composites decrease the E??? modulus during hygrothermal conditioning up to saturation point (6 weeks). However, for Glare laminates the E??? modulus remains unchanged (49 GPa) during the cycle of hygrothermal conditioning. The outer aluminum sheets in the Glare laminate shield the G/E composite laminae from moisture absorption, which in turn prevent, in a certain extent, the material from hygrothermal degradation effects. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding and improving the structural performance of FMLs therefore depends on characterizing the bridging phenomenon. Previously, mathematical models of bridging load transfer have been developed and verified for simplified circumstances:thin laminates with identical thicknesses and material composition through the laminate, identical crack lengths and delamination sizes, and simple tension loads. These models use a compatibility requirement at the delamination boundary to derive the bridging stress. This paper presents a generalized approach to solving the bridging problem that solves simultaneously for compatibility at every delamination boundary in the laminate, allowing the bridging load distribution to be derived for a laminate of arbitrary layup (different thicknesses and materials) with arbitrary damage (independent crack lengths and delamination sizes and shapes) and subject to arbitrary loading (any combination of applied tension and bending moment). The approach is evaluated by comparing its results to bridging stress distributions derived from finite element analysis. Good agreement was obtained for varied laminate and damage configurations, but some discrepancy exists in the presence of bending. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The reliability and applicability of this quantitative relation are validated by numerical simulations and experiments in three different lay-up composite laminates. Furthermore, combining this quantitative relation and the conventional ToF approach, an effective detection method is developed for damage localization in composite plate-like structures. By using PZT sensors, the method is conducted experimentally in a cross-ply laminate. The Gabor wavelet transform is introduced for signal processing to identify the ToF more exactly.

          "abstract": "Several important issues regarding damage simulation of composite laminates due to low velocity impact were investigated including contact law, damage initiation and the corresponding change of stiffness, and damping. Continuum damage mechanics was applied to account for the change of mechanical properties of damaged materials. The Hertzian contact law was modified in order to accommodate the serious damage in the plate. A semi-empirical delamination damage criterion was introduced. A finite element program was written in FORTRAN using twenty-noded solid elements with layered structure to analyze the transient dynamic response of composite laminates. In the simulation computations, variable material damping coefficients were applied to the elements according to damage in order to stabilize the computation. Damage in the forms of matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber breakage were included and analyzed. Results including the force history and delamination areas were found to correlate well with the experiments.",

          "abstract": "This work presents the acoustic emission (AE) behaviour of textile reinforced cementitious composite laminates (TRC) under tensile and flexural loading. The aim is to connect specific AE parameters and indices to the different fracture mechanisms that are successively activated within the failure process of the complex composite material. These mechanisms include multiple matrix cracking at low load and fibre pull-out after the maximum load is reached. Interlaminar shear is also activated during bending depending on the thickness of the laminates. Preliminary analysis indicates that frequency and AE waveform shape parameters are shifting, following the shift of fracturing mechanisms. Since the heterogeneous fibrous nature and the plate specimen geometry are bound to result in wave dispersion, multiple sensors are used to investigate the effect of wave distortion due to propagation. It is concluded that while AE indices can adequately characterize the fracture process in real time, the sensor separation distance should be accounted for, in order to produce reliable characterization of the damage mechanism regardless of the sensors location.",

The other is a newly developed CFRP, T800H/3900-2 with toughened interlaminar layers. The toughened interlaminar layers contain tough and fine polyamide particles dispersed in the base epoxy resin. By the edge observation, transverse crack density and delamination ratio are measured as a function of the number of stress cycles. By the X-ray radiography observation, delamination onset and growth in the width direction are detected.

The rehabilitation process consisted of: (1) epoxy injection, (2) addition of a bar within the clear cover of the column at the inside corner, and (3) external application of a multilayer composite system made of unidirectional carbon-epoxy layers placed at different orientations. The carbon fiber-reinforced polymeric system was heat-cured at a temperature of 80°±10°C (176°±18°F) for 6 hours. The performance was evaluated both before and after rehabilitation based on the progression of damage and the hysteretic behavior including the changes in the strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation characteristics. The results indicated that even a severely damaged corner joint can be effectively rehabilitated using CFRP to achieve a ductile beam failure mechanism. The joint was upgraded to withstand story drift ratios of up to 3.7% applied simultaneously in both directions.",

Due to this lack of physical basis, re-calibration is often needed when the specimen geometry and size are changed. More recent models such as the Damage Zone Model (DZM), Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) and the Effective Crack Growth Model (ECGM), have recognized the occurrence of progressive material softening ahead of the notch tip prior to catastrophic failure. However, since the anisotropic characteristic of the composite laminate has not been properly accounted for, these models may not be widely applicable for the laminates with different degrees of anisotropy. In this study, an Improved Cohesive Zone Model (ICZM) with proper consideration for anisotropy is proposed to predict the notched strength of composite laminate. Based on three fundamental parameters: namely the unnotched strength ∂o. the apparent fracture energy Gc and the effective longitudinal stiffness E&#039; , this model successfully predicted the strength of notched composite laminates with various degrees of anisotropy. The current model also gives accurate prediction of the progressive damage zone size in quasi-isotropic and cross-ply laminates.",

The acoustic emission signals detected during testing were analyzed by feature based pattern recognition techniques. In previous studies it was demonstrated that the presented approach for detection of distinct types of acoustic emission signals is suitable. The subsequent correlation of distinct acoustic emission signal types to microscopic failure mechanisms is based on two procedures. Firstly, the frequency of occurrence of the distinct signal types is correlated to different specimens&#039; fracture surface microstructure. Secondly, a comparison is made between experimental signals and signals resulting from finite element simulations based on a validated model for simulation of acoustic emission signals of typical failure mechanisms in fiber reinforced plastics. A distinction is made between fiber breakage, matrix cracking and interface failure. It is demonstrated, that the feature values extracted from simulated signals coincide well with those of experimental signals. As a result the applicability of the acoustic emission signal classification method for analysis of failure in carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforced plastics under mode-I loading conditions has been demonstrated. The quantification of matrix cracking, interfacial failure and fiber breakage was evaluated by interpretation of the obtained distributions of acoustic emission signals types in terms of fracture mechanics. The accumulated acoustic emission signal amplitudes show strong correlation to the mechanical properties of the specimens. Moreover, the changes in contribution to the different failure types explain the observed variation in failure behavior of the individual specimens quantitatively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Demand for advanced engineering composites in the aerospace industry is increasing continuously. Lately, carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRPs) became one of the most important structural materials in the industry due to a combination of characteristics such as: excellent stiffness, high strength-to-weight ratio, and ease of manufacture according to application. In service, aerospace composite components and structures are exposed to various transient loads, some of which can propagate in them as cyclic impacts. A typical example is an effect of the wind gusts during flight. This type of loading is known as impact fatigue (IF); it is a repetition of low-energy impacts. Such loads can cause various types of damage in composites: fibre breaking, transverse matrix cracking, de-bonding between fibres and matrix and delamination resulting in reduction of residual stiffness and loss of functionality. Furthermore, this damage is often sub-surface, which reinforces the need for more regular inspection. The effects of IF are of major importance due its detrimental effect on the structural integrity of components that can be generated after relatively few impacts at low force levels compared to those in a standard fatigue regime. This study utilises an innovative testing system with the capability of subjecting specimens to a series of repetitive impacts. The primary subject of this paper is to assess the damaging effect of IF on the behaviour of drilled CFRP specimens, exposed to such loading. A detailed damage analysis is implemented utilising an X-ray micro computed tomography system. The main findings suggested that at early stages of life damage is governed by o degree splits along the length of the specimens resulting in a 20% reduction of stiffness. The final failure damage scenario indicated that transverse crasks in the 90 degree plies are the main reason for complete delamination which can be translated to a 50% stiffness reduction. © 2011 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

          "abstract": "A new micro-mechanical model is proposed for describing the bridging actions exerted by through-thickness reinforcement on delaminations in prepreg based composite materials, subjected to a mixed-mode (I-II) loading regime. The model applies to micro-fasteners in the form of brittle fibrous rods (Z-pins) inserted in the through-thickness direction of composite laminates. These are described as Euler-Bernoulli beams inserted in an elastic foundation that represents the embedding composite laminate. Equilibrium equations that relate the delamination opening/sliding displacements to the bridging forces exerted by the Z-pins on the interlaminar crack edges are derived. The Z-pin failure meso-mechanics is explained in terms of the laminate architecture and the delamination mode. The apparent fracture toughness of Z-pinned laminates is obtained from as energy dissipated by the pull out of the through-thickness reinforcement, normalised with respect to a reference area. The model is validated by means of experimental data obtained for single carbon/BMI Z-pins inserted in a quasi-isotropic laminate. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "This chapter describes the stress-based Grant-Sanders method developed at British Aerospace for the prediction of failure in composite laminates. The method is based on a ply-by-ply analysis with discrete failure criteria. The only interactions considered being shear-tension for matrix failure and shear-compression for fiber failure. It has been applied to a number of examples to produce envelopes of initial and final failure and stress/strain curves. Hence, each failure prediction is accompanied by a prediction of the mode and location of failure. Nonlinear stiffnesses are accommodated by inputting curves of secant modulus versus strain. British Aerospace Defense has never used the ply-discount technique; however the shear and transverse tension stiffnesses have been taken to reduce gradually as strain increases above a threshold value. The chapter explains a recently developed procedure for the interaction of the matrix-dominated nonlinearities, which has been incorporated into the model. The use of discrete failure criteria gives an abrupt appearance, with sharp corners, to many of the predicted failure envelopes in contrast to the elliptical shapes produced by techniques based on tensor polynominals. It describes the lamina properties and the details of the laminates analyzed. Classical thin-laminate theory is used to determine the loading induced into each individual ply by the current level of applied loading. These ply loadings are then resolved into ply axes. An updated version of the Grant-Sanders method, based on stress criteria, has been used with the conventional notation for loading parallel and perpendicular to the fiber direction. Values of material and interactive constants used in this work, other than those supplied by the organizers, are also presented.",

This approach, pioneered by Hashin, applies the principle of minimum complementary energy to describe the stress state in a cross-ply laminate with transverse cracks. Apart from material data, only laminate geometry data and stress distribution assumptions are required. The model developed in the present study contains stress distribution assumptions that are closer to reality than previous models. Non-uniform stress distributions are included through-the-thickness of both the 0°- and the 90°-layers. An important result is the improved agreement with stiffness reduction data. As expected from the nature of the model, predictions generally provide lower bounds to the stiffness of the cracked laminate. However, at high crack densities, this is not the case. This additional stiffness reduction at high crack densities indicates the presence of new damage types, such as branched cracks and local delamination.",

Fiber bridging was reduced by offsetting the two centre plies by several degrees relative to each other. It has been shown that the fracture response of these slightly modified laminates is very different to that of conventional unidirectional composites. Offsetting the centre plies in double cantilever beam specimens resulted in a change in the mode of crack propagation from stable to unstable. The effects of varying processing parameters and loading rate were more pronounced in the offset specimens than in the standard unidirectional samples. It is concluded that even limited amounts of fiber bridging conceals the true interlaminar fracture response of many composite materials.",

Similar to crystalline metals, the regions of crack initiation, propagation and overload fracture can be discerned on the fracture surface of the specimen. Fatigue crack normally initiates in the metallic glass matrix at the outer surface of the composite specimen and propagates predominantly in the matrix. Different crack front profile around the tungsten fibers and fiber pullout demonstrate that fatigue crack may propagate around the fiber, leading to bridging of the crack faces by the unbroken fiber and hence improved fatigue crack-growth resistance. Locally decreased effective stiffness in the region where fiber distribution is sparse may provide preferential crack path in the composite.

Due to their anisotropic nature and complicated architecture, it is very difficult to reveal the damage mechanisms of these materials from the results of mechanical tests. Therefore, there is a need to conduct reliable simulations and analytical evaluations. In this paper, the damage behavior of FRP is simulated by finite element analysis using an anisotropic damage model based on damage mechanics. The proposed procedure is applied to an example; the finite element analysis of microscopic damage propagation in woven fabric composites. Experimental tests have been conducted to evaluate the validity of the proposed method. It is recognized that there is a good agreement between the computational and experimental results, and that the proposed simulation method is very useful for the evaluation of damage mechanisms. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Three types of specimens with axial fiber tows at angles of 30??, 60??, and 75?? to the direction of loading were studied under uniaxial compression loading using a modified compression loading fixture that has anti-buckling guides. Static tests were carried out using a hydraulically activated MTS loading frame, while, low velocity impact tests were conducted using a drop tower facility. A three parameter homogenized orthotropic plasticity model was used to characterize the inelastic response and the constants associated with this characterization were determined uniquely. Results from this characterization were subsequently used to analyze the rate dependent interfacial effects in these materials. Two types of composites made from two different resins, but with the same textile architecture were used for this study.

Compressive properties and micro-structural damage progression under high strain rate loading have been investigated using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar technique.

The stress strain responses at strain rates ranging 490-1470 s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; under various environmental conditions have been investigated and the relevant failure modes have also been identified by optical and scanning electron microscopic examinations. The results indicate that moisture and temperature degrade the compressive failure strength under high strain rate loading. The level of such degradation is seen to vary with strain rates and loading direction. In general, the failure strength and failure strain of both dry and wet samples are seen to be increased under high strain rate loading. The strain rate sensitivity of the woven composites is more significant if the failure is dominated by the resin materials. High temperature tests were conducted at temperatures ranging 23-204Â°C. The maximum rate effect is observed below the glass transition temperature, T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; (121Â°C) specifically for TD specimens.

It was found that carbon fiber reinforced composites perform better in fatigue loading, in comparison to glass fiber reinforced composites, due to the fact that the state of stress within the matrix material was considerably lower for carbon fiber reinforced composites eliminating (or at least prolonging) fatigue damage initiation. The effect of polymer aging was also evaluated through thermal aging of neat resin specimens. Short-term viscoelastic material properties of unaged and aged neat resin specimens were measured using Dynamic Mechanical Analysis. With increasing aging time a corresponding increase in storage modulus was found. Increases in the storage modulus of the epoxy matrix subsequently resulted in a higher state of predicted stress within the matrix material from representative volume element analyses. Various parameters common to unidirectional composites were numerically investigated and found to have varying levels of impact on the prediction of the initiation of fatigue damage. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The effects of fabric tension and number of impregnation rollers used during hot-melt prepreg processing were investigated as they relate to woven fabric prepreg and final composite part quality. Specifically, the processing parameters varied in a design of experiments (DOE) were applied fabric tension and the number of impregnation rollers, while maintaining the same impregnation force. Six experimental prepregs were characterized in terms of prepreg thickness, resin content, tack, and morphology. The results show that fabric tension had a large influence on the prepreg characteristics due to more cylindrical tow shapes and a ridged fiber bed. The number of impregnation rollers was found to affect only the characteristics of the prepregs manufactured with no tension. To investigate the effects of tension on cured composites, six ply laminates were made with each experimental prepreg. Two cure cycles, differing only in consolidation pressures, were used to examine the void content and morphology in the cured laminates. The laminates made with prepregs manufactured with high tension and cured only under vacuum had a greater void content than laminates made with prepregs manufactured with no tension. In both cure cycles, the tow shape in the laminates made from the prepreg manufactured with high tension remained in almost the same shape as in the uncured prepreg. The void content, however, was negligible for all laminates cured at higher consolidation pressure.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to compare and elucidate the differences in damage mechanisms and response of fiber-reinforced dental resin composites based on three different brands under flexural loading. The types of reinforcement consisted of a unidirectional E-glass prepreg (Splint-It from Jeneric/Petron Inc.), an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber based biaxial braid (Connect, Kerr) and an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber based leno-weave (Ribbond). Methods: Three different commercially available fiber reinforcing systems were used to fabricate rectangular bars, with the fiber reinforcement close to the tensile face, which were tested in flexure with an emphasis on studying damage mechanisms and response. Eight specimens (n = 8) of each type were tested. Overall energy capacity as well as flexural strength and modulus were determined and results compared in light of the different abilities of the architectures used. Results: Under flexural loading unreinforced and unidirectional prepreg reinforced dental composites failed in a brittle fashion, whereas the braid and leno-weave reinforced materials underwent significant deformation without rupture. The braid reinforced specimens showed the highest peak load. The addition of the unidirectional to the matrix resulted in an average strain of 0.06 mm/mm which is 50% greater than the capacity of the unreinforced matrix, whereas the addition of the braid and leno-weave resulted in increases of 119 and 126%, respectively, emphasizing the higher capacity of both the UHM polyethylene fibers and the architectures to hold together without rupture under flexural loading. The addition of the fiber reinforcement substantially increases the level of strain energy in the specimens with the maximum being attained in the braid reinforced specimens with a 433% increase in energy absorption capability above the unreinforced case. The minimum scatter and highest consistency in response is seen in the leno-weave reinforced specimens due to the details of the architecture which restrict fabric shearing and movement during placement. Significance: It is crucial that the appropriate selection of fiber architectures be made not just from a perspective of highest strength, but overall damage tolerance and energy absorption. Differences in weaves and architectures can result in substantially different performance and appropriate selection can mitigate premature and catastrophic failure. The study provides details of materials level response characteristics which are useful in selection of the fiber reinforcement based on specifics of application. ?? 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.",

In experimental biaxial testing, two types of crack orientations (0°, 45°) are studied with varying crack lengths. The experimental failure points show that cross-ply GFRP laminates attain higher load bearing capability under biaxial tensile–tensile loading compared to uniaxial testing. Appropriate non-dimensional geometry factor relevant to cruciform shape is determined based on experimental data points and FE simulation. Eventually, a mixed-mode fracture criterion is proposed for cross-ply composite laminate based on the findings from biaxial experimental loading.",

Experimental results show that PL orientation gives the highest value of friction coefficients followed by NL and CL. Microscopic investigations of the worn surfaces are conducted to identify the operating wear mechanism. They reveal that the weaving configuration in CL orientation inhibits an easy detachment of fibres during the wear process. Therefore, intermediate values of wear resistance between PL and NL orientation are obtained. Furthermore, entrapped soft components of matrix resin between laminates in CL orientation play an important role in reducing the friction coefficient. In NL orientation, the individual fibres within the laminates do not get mutual support as in PL orientation. As a result, fibres suffer bending at their ends, leading to an easy shear mechanism.",

          "abstract": "It is well known that composite laminates are easily damaged by low-velocity impact. The internal delaminations can drastically reduce the compressive strength of laminates. In this study, a numerical analysis for predicting the residual compressive strength of delaminated plates is proposed. The delaminated interfaces are modelled by using interface elements connecting the three-dimensional solid elements modelling the composite layers. Delamination propagation is modelled by using a damage model based on the indirect use of fracture mechanics. Due to the complex stress state of the problem, a mixed-mode analysis including the three modes of fracture was considered. Experimental studies were performed on carbon–epoxy [04, 904]s and [904, 04]s laminates. They included low-velocity impact tests, followed by X-ray damage characterisation and compression tests. Good agreement between experimental and numerical analysis was obtained.",

It was observed that in general, these properties deteriorated with the increase in fiber orientation angle, though composite with 90?? fibers was not poorest in mechanical properties. Overall, CF reinforcement in 0?? (parallel to loading direction) enhanced all strength and modulus properties of PEI significantly. Tribo-evaluation in adhesive wear mode on pin on disc machine against mild steel under different loads indicated that the coefficient of friction (??) increased with fiber angle with respect to sliding direction and decreased with load, in general. Very low specific wear rate (K0), in the order of 4-7 ?? 10-16 m3/Nm was observed for 0?? orientation while fibers in 90?? showed wear rate in the range of 14-25 ?? 10-16 m3/Nm, which was approximately four times higher than the earlier case. Overall fiber reinforcement in 0?? orientation proved beneficial from both strength and tribo-performance point of view. SEM proved useful to correlate wear rate with wear mechanisms. Gradual decrease in extent of wear thinning of long fibers and increase in brittle fracture of fibers and their peeling off tendency from the matrix with increase in angle of fiber orientation were observed to be the main reasons for the deterioration of tribo-properties of composites with increase in fiber orientation in composites from 0?? to 90??. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The damage area was assessed with combined effects of different impact energies and porosity levels. The damage area was evaluated by visual inspection and ultrasonic C-scan measurement. The thermal deply technique was used to evaluate the damage evolution behavior.

The GRP was stitched through the thickness with Kevlar thread in two orientations with a low or high stitch density. The Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness, GIc, increased with stitch density whereas the Mode II toughness, GIIc, was not changed by stitching. The three-point flexural strength and short-beam interlaminar shear strength of the GRP before impact loading were reduced by stitching as a result of stitching damage. Under short-beam loading, the stitches become sites of stress concentration and this contributed to the reduction in interlaminar shear strength. The strengths of the laminates were reduced slightly with increasing impact energy after one impact. The strengths were reduced considerably with increasing number of impacts. The laminates suffered severe microstructural damage under repeated impacts, including shear cracking of the resin, delaminations, and crushing and fracture of the glass fibres. The impact damage resistance, the post-impact flexural strength and the interlaminar shear strength of the GRP were not improved by stitching, and this finding differs from other impact studies on stitched composites.",

The ECM was adopted to mainly predict the in-plane stiffness reduction of the damaged laminate. Basic consideration that progressive matrix cracking provokes a re-distribution of the stress fields on each lamina within laminates, which greatly deteriorates the stress distributed in the primary load-bearing lamina and leads to the final failure of the laminates, is introduced for the construction of the failure criterion. The effects of lamina properties, lay-up configurations and loading conditions on the behaviors of the laminates were examined in this paper. A comparison of numerical results obtained from the established model and other existed models and published experimental data was presented for different material systems.

These mechanical methods are usually superior to other connections, particularly when joining thick composite laminates. Stress distributions, damage modes and ultimate strengths in notched or bolted FRP laminate designs are of particular interest to the industrial community. To predict the ultimate strengths and the failure processes of notched or bolted composite laminates, nonlinear progressive damage analyses (PDA) based on the finite element method (FEM) at the meso-scale level are performed in this paper. A three-dimensional strength criterion in terms of strains, which can distinguish different damage modes, was developed and adopted in the analysis model to detect damage initiation in the laminates. Different material degradation methods and the influence of cohesive layers were discussed and compared with results of verification experiments. The results showed that the analysis model that used the succinct strength criterion proposed in this paper could properly predict the damage initiation and the ultimate strengths of notched or bolted FRP laminates. The errors between the numerical results and experimental data were small. The material degradation method with continuum damage mechanics (CDM)-based exponential damage factors using the damage index as the independent variable achieved greater accuracy and convergence than the method with CDM-based exponential damage factors using the square index as the independent variable or than the method with constant damage factors. Adding cohesive layers in the model had negligible influence on the final results, largely because the succinct analysis model proposed in this paper is sufficiently accurate in cases of small delamination.",

Longitudinal tensile, transverse tensile and in-plane shear properties were measured using [0]8, [90]10 and [??45]10 laminates as a function of moisture absorption. The results revealed that the rate and amount of swelling in through thickness was more as compared to longitudinal and transverse directions. The longitudinal tensile strength dropped by 25-30% during first month of the exposure period and remained constant within the experimental scatter during rest of the exposure time. The transverse tensile strength showed decreasing trend during exposure period. Longitudinal tensile modulus decreased during first 2 months of exposure time and remained constant during rest of the exposure time. In-plane shear strength showed increasing-decreasing trend during the exposure period. Transverse tensile modulus, in-plane shear modulus and Poisson&#039;s ratio remained constant during the exposure period. Finally, the possible mechanisms for the failure are discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The purpose of this work is to establish the ability of a material system to be used in aircraft engine nacelles when subjected to static loadings, with a key upper temperature of 120??C. In order to provide answers to this question, the thermo-mechanical behaviors of carbon fiber fabric reinforced PPS or epoxy laminates have been compared specifically within the temperature change with 120??C at the upper bound. The temperature-dependent ductile behavior of laminates is more or less exacerbated, depending on polymers glass transition temperature, and laminates stacking sequence. For both materials, the degree of retention of tensile mechanical properties is quite high in notched and unnotched quasi-isotropic laminates. A Digital Image Correlation technique has been used in order to understand the influence of temperature and matrix ductility on the mechanisms of overstresses accommodation near the hole. In fabric reinforced laminates, the high-temperature results suggest a competition between the mechanisms of damage, and the mechanism of plasticization, enhanced in angle-ply lay-ups. Thus, the highly ductile behavior of TP-based laminates, at temperatures higher than their Tg, is very effective to accommodate the overstresses near the hole. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Various forms of damage were observed in pressure- less-sintered Al2O3/ZrO2 symmetric laminates and asym- metric laminates (bilayers) fabricated by tape casting and lamination. These defects included channel cracks in the ZrO2 layers, Al2O3 edge-effect cracks parallel to the layers, delamination in the Al2O3 layers, and debonding between the Al2O3 and ZrO2 layers. Based on detailed microscopic observations, the defects were attributed to sintering rate and thermal expansion mismatch between the layers. Cracks or cracklike defects were formed in the early stages of densification, and these cracks either opened during sin- tering or acted as preexisting flaws for thermal expansion mismatch cracks. Consequently, the extent of cracking could be reduced or even eliminated by decreasing mis- match stresses during the sintering and cooling stages. This can be accomplished by reducing the heating and/or cooling rates or by adding Al2O3 in the ZrO2 layers. The sintering mismatch stresses were estimated from the degree of curl- ing in asymmetric laminates and from layer viscosities that were obtained by cyclic loading dilatometry. The measured curvature was an indication of the mismatch in sintering strain between Al2O3 and ZrO2 and were consistent with the dilatometric data that were obtained for the component layers. I.",

The multiscale model is based on the embedded cell method, with detailed microstructure embedded into the macro laminate beneath the impact point, and a transition zone is introduced to link these two scales. Damage model is considered for the fibres and plastic behaviour for the matrix, and cohesive elements are used for the simulation of interface delamination. Both unidirectional and layup embedded cells are considered in the simulation so as to reveal the impact damage mechanisms from monolayer to layup levels. The simulation results indicate matrix cracking is the first damage form which occurs at the bottom of the laminate, and then delamination is induced when the matrix crack propagates to the interface, followed by fibre pull-out and fibre breakage. The simulation results are compared with available experimental results from literatures, with good agreements achieved between them on the damage morphologies. Thus the ability of the presented multiscale model to reveal the damage mechanisms of composite laminate under low velocity impact is validated.",

Pure mode I tests are carried out on several carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy woven composites configurations and the differences observed are discussed from a fractographic point of view. A novel experimental method is designed to perform dynamic pure mode I tests. The study illustrates the high fracture toughness of the composites made of woven fabrics as well as the influence of the orientation of the plies, the nature of the fibers and the addition of an adhesive film on the fracture toughness in mode I.

The paper presents the results of the FEM/Strain energy investigations carried out to predict anisotropic-damping matrix comprising of loss factors η11, η22, η12 and η23 considering the dissipation of energy due to fiber and matrix (two phase) and correlate the same with various micromechanical theories. Damping in three phase (i.e., fiber-interphase-matrix) composite is also calculated as an attempt to understand the effect of interphase. The contribution of energy dissipation due to sliding at the fiber-matrix interface is incorporated to evaluate its effect on η11, η22, η12 and η23 in fiber-reinforced composite having damage in the form of hairline debonding. Comparative studies of the various micromechanical theories/models with FEM/Strain energy method for the prediction of damping coefficients have shown consistency when both the effect of variable nature of stress and the fiber interaction is considered. Parametric damping studies for three phase composite have shown that the change in properties of fiber, matrix and interphase leads to a change in the magnitude of effectiveness of interphase, but the manner in which the interphase would affect the various loss factors depends predominately upon whether the hard or soft interphase is chosen. Analysis of the effect of damage on composite damping indicates that it is sensitive to its orientation and type of loading. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

A tangent operator consistent with the integration procedure is derived to ensure a computational efficiency of the Newton-Raphson method in the finite element analysis. The algorithm is implemented in Abaqus as a user-defined subroutine.

These materials have the potential for becoming load bearing structural members, therefore a wide array of structural and non-structural applications are possible. However, their heterogeneous, laminated, fibrous nature complicates the understanding of their fracture behavior. During bending, the developed stresses lead to the activation of damage mechanisms like matrix cracking, fiber pull-out delamination and in succession or in overlap. In this study, the flexural behavior of TRC laminates is monitored by acoustic emission (AE). AE sensors record the elastic waves radiated from the damage sources and enable the characterization of the fracture behavior in any stage. The aim is to examine if AE is sensitive enough to provide feedback on the applied stress field in such heterogeneous systems. Therefore, the three-point bending span is varied to modify the stress field and specifically the proportion of shear to normal stress. AE waveform parameters like duration and frequency reveal information about the mode of fracture for the different spans, while the stress field is derived by a finite element model (FEM). The results show that AE is suitable to characterize the stress field even from the early loading stages, monitor the corresponding damage mechanisms and provide valuable feedback to the material modeling. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First deterministic optimization is used to investigate possible weight reduction measures. Reducing axial loads on walls by auxiliary stiffening mechanisms led to significant weight reduction. Reliability-based optimizations were performed to identify the uncertainties in composite material properties with the largest influences on the optimum design.

This study uses a three-dimensional finite element (FE) method and experimental measurements to provide physical insight into the scattering phenomena. Good agreement is found between simulations and experimental measurements. The results show that the A(0) Lamb wave scattering at a delamination in composite laminates is much more complicated than the scattering at a defect in isotropic plates. Scatter amplitudes and scatter directivity distributions depend on the delamination size to wavelength ratio and the through-thickness location of the delamination damage. The study also investigates the feasibility of the common experimental practice of simulating delamination damage by bonding masses to the surface of composite laminates for guided wave damage detection and characterization methodologies verifications. The results suggest that care is required to use bonded masses to simulate delamination damage for verifying and optimizing damage characterization techniques. In summary, the results of the investigation help to further advance the use of the A(0) Lamb wave for damage detection and characterization.",

The functions of PFCT as an embedded sensor inside the composite structure are threefold: (i) to detect all loading conditions acting on to the structure, (ii) to predict the occurrence of damage while in-service under dynamic loads, and (iii) to monitor the pre-existing damages in the composite structures so that the severity can be ascertained to avoid eventual catastrophic or brittle failures. PFCT will be an ideal choice for composite structures applications, as they are highly flexible, easily embeddable; their high compatibility to the composite manufacturing techniques, and more importantly, it is expected that they will produce significantly less interfacial stresses when embedded inside the composite structures. Two types of PFCTs (macro fiber composite (MFC – from Smart Materials Corp.), and piezoelectric fiber composite (PFC – from Advance Cerametrics Inc.)) have been selected and calibrated by investigating their sensor performances based on characteristics; like transfer function, sensitivity, nonlinearity, resolution, and noise levels. Dynamic loads (transverse and longitudinal) have been applied and their corresponding output response is evaluated. The sensitivity of these products to the changes in frequencies and strain levels of input dynamic loads is investigated through the constant strain and frequency curves. Healthy voltage output response is observed even at low strain level domains, which indicates their high sensitivity and high resolution as a sensor. Comparing the results, it can be concluded that these sensors demonstrated their superior sensitivity and better performance over the traditional strain gauges. After a detailed sensor performance assessment, a case study has been conducted on the composite beam structure, where the ability of the PFCTs to detect the delamination of various levels inside the composite beam structure through modal analysis has been investigated. Then tests were performed to investigate the ability of the embedded PFCT sensors to detect the changes in the applied input mechanical stress/strain when embedded inside glass fiber–epoxy composite laminate samples. It is found that these sensors are effectively able to detect the changes in the applied input mechanical stress/strain. A linear relationship has been observed between the applied input mechanical stress and the sensor generated voltage output.",

          "abstract": "The effect of fiber arrangement on transverse tensile failure in unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composites with a strong fiber-matrix interface was studied using a unit-cell model that includes a continuum damage mechanics model. The simulated results indicated that tensile strength is lower when neighboring fibers are arrayed parallel to the loading direction than with other fiber arrangements. A shear band occurs between neighboring fibers, and the damage in the matrix propagates around the shear band when the interfacial normal stress (INS) is sufficiently high. Moreover, based on the observation of Hobbiebrunken et al.; we reproduced the damage process in actual composites with a nonuniform fiber arrangement. The simulated results clarified that the region where neighboring fibers are arrayed parallel to the loading direction becomes the origin of the transverse failure in the composites. The cracking sites observed in the simulation are consistent with experimental results. Therefore, the matrix damage in the region where the fiber is arrayed parallel to the loading direction is a key factor in understanding transverse failure in unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composites with a strong fiber/matrix interface. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To this purpose, a series of quasi-static indentation experiments was conducted on AS4D/TC350 carbon/epoxy specimens. The induced damage at different indenter displacements was characterized using electron microscopy and C-scan, while the residual indentation profiles were captured with a 3D surface roughness machine. The indentation depth was shown to have relaxed after the test, reaching a steady value after 14 days. For the conditions explored, the relaxation was not dependent on the damage extent. The results showed that matrix cracking is in fact the crucial damage mechanism as it is responsible for the first sudden loss of load capacity and triggers the progressive growth of delaminations.",

Specimens with 15??, 30??, and 45?? off-axis angles were prepared and tested under monotonic and incremental cyclic tension and compression loads. The obtained results were compared with those of uniaxial tension, compression, and shear specimens. The relationships between the damage modes and the stress state were analyzed based on scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) observations and acoustic emission (AE) data. The test results reveal the remarkable axial anisotropy and unilateral behavior of the material. The off-axis tension test results show that the material is fiber-dominant and the evolution rate of damage and inelastic strain is accelerated under the corresponding combined biaxial tension and shear loads. Due to the damage impediment effect of compression stress, compression specimens show higher mechanical properties and lower damage evolution rates than tension specimens with the same off-axis angle. Under cyclic tensioncompression loadings, both on-axis and off-axis specimens exhibit progressive damage deactivation behaviors in the compression range, but with different deactivation rates.",

Experimental models are scaled as one-story steel shear panel models with hinge type connections as boundaries at four corners. In the first test, unstiffened steel infill plate is used for the testing as a reference test. However, in the next four tests, strengthened steel infill plates were used with different numbers and orientation of GFRP layers. Each test was performed under fully reversed cyclic quasi-static loading in the elastic and inelastic response zones of the specimens, in compliance with the ATC-24 (1992) test protocol. The experimental results indicated that by strengthening the infill steel plates yield by laminates strength, ultimate shear strength and cumulative dissipated energy can be significantly increased.

Ultrasonic C-scans and micrographs were used for the post-test damage inspection, where matrix cracking and delaminations were observed as the major impact damage modes. Tensile preloading was found to reduce the extent of delaminations, while compressive preload led to an increased extent of delaminations resulting from a higher bending deflection of the plate under impact.

          "abstract": "The impact response of fiber metal laminates ({FMLs)}, has been investigated with experiments and numerical simulations, which is reported in this article. Low-velocity impacts were carried out to study the effects of metal type and thickness within {FMLs.} Glare5-3/2 laminates with two aluminum layer thicknesses and a similar {FML} containing magnesium sheets were impacted by drop weight tests. Also, a major part of this study was to accomplish a dynamic non-linear transient analysis to study the impact response of {FMLs} using the commercial finite element ({FE)} analysis code {ABAQUS.} By reviewing different approaches of modeling constituents of an {FML}, it is shown that the appropriate selection of elements has more significant role than failure criterion to predict acceptable results for this type of laminate and loading. The good agreement obtained between experimental and numerical results verifies the possibility of relatively simpler simulation by {FE-analysis} to predict overall response of {FMLs} under impact loading.",

          "abstract": "This work aims at determining whether thermoplastic-based composites can be used in secondary aircraft structures to replace thermosetting-based composites or not. In order to answer this question, the mechanical behaviors of carbon fiber fabric reinforced thermoplastic (PPS or PEEK) and thermosetting (epoxy) laminates subjected to different stress states under severe environmental conditions (120??C after hygrothermal aging) have been compared. In addition to usual mechanical tests (tensile, open hole tensile), single-bolt double lap joint and single-bolt single lap joint tests were also performed. Severe conditions help enhance the ductile behavior of the epoxy matrix, but degrade the fiber/matrix interface, resulting in lower stiffness and strength of laminates with a quasi-isotropic lay-up. In thermoplastic-based laminates, the degree of retention of mechanical properties is quite high even for PPS-based laminates when T&gt;Tg. In laminates with a [45]7 lay-up, severe conditions adversely affect the mechanical properties of the three composite systems. However, the combination of matrix ductile behavior, and the strain gradient near the hole, lead to an extensive plastic deformation along the ??45?? oriented fibers bundles in notched A-P laminates. It results in decreasing significantly the hole-sensitivity of C/PPS and C/Epoxy under severe conditions. In bolted joints, a severe environment has a limited impact on the bearing strength of epoxy-based laminates. In the case of thermoplastic-based laminates, it increases the strength of double lap joints, but is detrimental to the strength of single lap joints. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The chapter represents the Part B of the Exercise, where the laminate response and failure predictions for 14 different cases are presented and compared with actual experimental test data. The cases include prediction of the effective nonlinear stress vs. strain responses of laminates and initial and final ply failure envelope predictions under multiaxial loading. Correlation between the theoretical predictions and experimental results are discussed. While reasonable correlation is achieved, the failure analysis employed by the authors is not universally accurate in predicting the laminate failure response for the broad range of test cases considered.

Selected geometries of sandwich beams were tested to illustrate these collapse modes, with good agreement between analytic predictions and measurements of the failure load. Finite element (FE) simulations of the three-point bending responses of these beams were also conducted by constructing a FE model by laying up unidirectional plies in appropriate orientations. The initiation and growth of damage in the laminates were included in the FE calculations. With this embellishment, the FE model was able to predict the measured load versus displacement response and the failure sequence in each of the composite beams.",

Questions related to delamination resistance of CFRP composites with implications for composite structural design and testing include, e.g., the determination of threshold values in cyclic fatigue, the question of conservative mode (mode I versus mode II), approaches for data analysis, and possible analogies in short crack cyclic fatigue between fracture behavior of structural metal alloys and CFRP. The scatter in Paris-type law data analysis of cyclic fatigue tests and the resulting apparent threshold behavior that has implications for composite structural design will be presented.

This is achieved by introducing a general form of mapping function and an arbitrary biaxial loading condition into the boundary conditions. In addition, the basic formulation is extended for multilayered plates. By introducing into the computer program, the constants of the mapping function, the arbitrary biaxial loading factor, the orientation angle and the complex parameters for the laminate, the stresses around the hole can be easily obtained. This solution is useful to study the effect of the above parameters on stress distribution. To illustrate the usefulness of the solution, results are obtained for various shapes of holes, loading conditions and laminate geometry. Failure strength is determined using different failure criteria. It is noted that the stress distribution around a given a shape of hole depends on the combined effect of hole geometry, type of loading and laminate geometry.",

The thickness of the cross-ply skins varies from 8 to 16 plies, whereas the density of the 12.7-mm thick aluminum honeycomb core varies from 50 to 70 kg/m3. Clamped panels with a 100-mm testing area are loaded quasi-statically either in bending or on a rigid base. The effects of varying these parameters on damage mechanisms are examined through response curves as well as cross sections of selected specimens. Special emphasis is placed on their potential change induced by the variation of skin thickness and core density with a specific indenter. Damage mechanisms are identified as core crush, top-skin delamination, and fracture or shear-out. The threshold and ultimate loads as well as the initial slope increase significantly either on increase of skin thickness or change of the nose shape of indenter from a hemisphere to a flat-end. The increase in the post-initial-damage slope is small and can be attributed to membrane stretching of the damaged top skin. Increasing the core density affects substantially not only the threshold load, but also the initial slope associated with the FE indenter. Changing the nose shape of the indenter has an overriding effect on the nature of damage mechanisms. In particular, top-skin delaminations occur after core crush. The panel deflection contributes to 20-53% sandwich deformation. The bottom skin in all the tests remains intact.",

The porosity is varied through impregnation and pyrolysis of a ceramic precursor solution. Mechanical tests are performed to assess the role of the matrix in both matrix-dominated and fiber-dominated loading configurations. The results demonstrate a loss in damage tolerance and tensile strength along the fiber direction as the porosity is reduced. Concomitantly, some improvements in interlaminar strength are obtained. The latter improvements are found to be difficult to quantify over the entire porosity range using the standard short beam shear method, a consequence of the increased propensity for tensile fracture as the porosity is reduced. Measurements of interlaminar shear strength based on the double-notched shear specimen are broadly consistent with the limited values obtained by the short beam shear method, although the former exhibit large variability. In addition, effects of precursor segregation during drying on through-thickness gradients in matrix properties and their role in composite performance are identified and discussed. An analysis based on the mechanics of crack deflection and penetration at an interphase boundary is presented and used to draw insights regarding the role of matrix properties in enabling damage tolerance in porous-matrix composites. Deficiencies in the understanding of the mechanisms that enable damage tolerance in this class of composites are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Impact tests with a falling dart and flexural measurements were carried out on polypropylene based laminates reinforced with glass fibers fabrics. Research has shown that the strong fiber/matrix interface obtained through the use of a compatibilizer increased the mechanical performance of such composite systems. The improved adhesion between fibers and matrix weakly affects the flexural modulus but strongly influences the ultimate properties of the investigated woven fabric composites. In fact, bending tests have shown a clear improvement in the flexural strength for the compatibilized systems, in particular when a high viscosity/high crystallinity polypropylene was used. On the contrary, the low velocity impact tests indicated an opposite dependence on the interface strength, and higher energy absorption in not compatibilized composites was detected. This result has been explained in terms of failure mechanisms at the fiber/matrix interface, which are able to dissipate large amounts of energy through friction phenomena. Pull-out of fibers from the polypropylene matrices have been evidenced by the morphological analysis of fracture surfaces after failure and takes place before the fibers breakage, as confirmed by the evaluation of the ductility index. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

During ageing under a constant stress above the threshold level necessary for the first crack initiation in the matrix, a significant decrease of Young&#039;s modulus with time occurs, correlated with acoustic emission, which indicates a damage evolution. Additionally it is found that both elastic and inelastic strains increase with time. These static fatigue effects depend on the loading conditions (loading rate and maximum stress level) and lead either to an equilibrium state or to delayed failure for sufficiently high stresses. An interfacial shear stress dependence upon the load level is the most probable mechanism to explain these phenomena.",

Mode I crack growth specimens were used to study branching through 0??, 90?? and 45??plies. The results showed that crack growth through 0??plies could be promoted by a ply gap, but this was not as controllable as combining a ply gap with a pre-crack to create a &quot;crack branch flaw&quot;. Crack branching through 45??plies could be controlled using crack branch flaws, and also promoted controllably using ply gaps. Crack branching through 90??plies was seen without any flaws, but was better controlled with embedded delaminations. Using these outcomes, crack branching through two quasi-isotropic laminates was demonstrated.

Hysteresis loops were captured during these tests and the form of stress versus number of cycles to failure (S-N) curves was established. Reversed loading is the most damaging mode of cyclic stress application. In terms of static strengths, the wood laminate is weaker in compression than in tension. However at low levels of stress, following many fatigue cycles, the fatigue life is greater in compression-compression than in tension-tension. The shape of captured hysteresis loops is strongly influenced by loading mode. As subcritical damage develops, loop area increases and dynamic modulus falls. In reversed loading, loop bending and distortion is observed depending on whether the damage is tension- or compression-dominated or both. Maximum and minimum fatigue strains, the dynamic modulus and loop area have been plotted as a function of the number of fatigue cycles. The majority of damage occurs towards the end of the sample life but property changes can be detected throughout fatigue tests. Normalisation of fatigue data demonstrates that the fatigue behaviour of wood-epoxy laminates is consistent.",

In this paper, extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are embedded in carbon/epoxy composite laminates and used to monitor the cure process simultaneously. Furthermore, measurements of residual strains of composite laminates during the cure have been performed. The results show that both EFPI and FBG sensors can be used to monitor the strain development of composite laminates with and without damage during cure.

Stress relaxation tests are performed at 100 ??C for 5 h on plain coupon specimens of three types of angle-ply laminates [??30]3S, [??45]3S and [??60] 3S under displacement controlled conditions. For each ply orientation, the stress relaxation tests are carried out at three different strain levels. Stress relaxation phenomena clearly appear in all kinds of angle-ply laminate. The average stress in the angle-ply laminates rapidly relaxes to approach a steady-state value associated with the strain sustained. The rate of stress relaxation in the angle-ply laminates substantially diminishes in the tested time range. Stress relaxation simulation of the angle-ply laminates is performed using the classical laminated plate theory and a phenomenological viscoplasticity model for individual plies. Material constants involved in the ply viscoplasticity model are identified on the basis of the off-axis creep behavior for a unidirectional laminate based on the same kind of carbon/epoxy prepregs. Excellent agreements between the predicted and observed results are obtained by taking into account a local recovery of total strain in the gauge-length part of specimens as well as a fiber rotation induced by deformation. The successful application of the ply viscoplasticity model confirms that the stress relaxation behavior is consistent with the creep behavior in the same composite system. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The technique is implemented for 8-ply and 16-ply quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy laminates with embedded Teflon film patches and damage induced by low velocity impact loading. The technique shows excellent improvement in the time resolution so that it can be used effectively for extracting exact time-of-flight information and then constructing accurate B-scan and three-dimensional images of defects in thin composites.

A finite element modeling framework is proposed for the sandwich composite comprising continuum damage, cohesive layers and crushable foam model with isotropic hardening for the core. The model shows how progressive damage in the facesheets, interlaminar damage between the layers and the crushable foam can be used to model low velocity impact and temperature effects. Ultrasonic testing and high speed cameras are used to determine the damage and delamination characteristics. The higher exposure temperatures result in larger damage zones for both the low and high impact energies. The elevated temperature enhanced the penetration rate and indentation depth showing degradations in the out of plane properties. The visible damage test results in significant damage in the core and facesheets dependent on the temperature ranges tested. In the barely visible damage category, the composite facesheet layers attached to the foam experience a tension failure under low energy impact despite surface indications showing no fiber fracture.",

Here, pyramidal truss sandwich cores with relative densities ρ¯ in the range 1–10% have been manufactured from carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates by employing a snap-fitting method. The measured quasi-static shear strength varied between 0.8 and 7.5MPa. Two failure modes were observed: (i) Euler buckling of the struts and (ii) delamination failure of the laminates. Micro-buckling failure of the struts was not observed in the experiments reported here while Euler buckling and delamination failures occurred for the low (ρ¯⩽1%) and high (ρ¯&gt;1%) relative density cores, respectively. Analytical models for the collapse of the composite cores by these failure modes are presented. Good agreement between the measurements and predictions based on the Euler buckling and delamination failure of the struts is observed while the micro-buckling analysis over-predicts the measurements. The CFRP pyramidal cores investigated here have a similar mechanical performance to CFRP honeycombs. Thus, for a range of multi-functional applications that require an “open-celled” architecture (e.g. so that cooling fluid can pass through a sandwich core), the CFRP pyramidal cores offer an attractive alternative to honeycombs.",

The use of composite laminates necessitates the inclusion of fiber orientation angle of the layers as well as total thickness of the laminate as design variables in the design optimization problem. The wing box design problem is decomposed into several independent local panel design problems. In general such an approach results in a nonblended solution with no continuity of laminate lay ups across the panels, which may not only increase the lay up cost but may also be structurally unsafe due to discontinuities. The need for a blended solution increases the complexity of the problem many fold. In this paper we impose the blending constraints globally by using a guide based design methodology within the genetic algorithm optimization scheme and compare the results with the published ones. Two different blending schemes - outer and inner blending are presented. The result shows that the optimum design obtained using the current methodology has better continuity of laminate lay ups and also the reported weight of the composite wing box is on the lower side. Finally, a parametric study of the effect of global deflection constraint on the total weight of the optimum design is presented. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The fiber is made of a nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) shape memory alloy (SMA), while the matrix consists of a shape memory thermoset epoxy polymer (SMP). The use of an SMP matrix provides large strain compatibility with the SMA fiber, while being active at high temperatures without losing its elastic properties. Additionally, the SMP matrix is also able to produce similar pseudoelastic and shape memory effects, which are noticed in SMAs. In the analysis, a two step homogenization scheme is followed. In the first step the effective properties of each layer are determined via a micromechanics approach with iso-strain conditions. In the second step the effective properties of the SMF-SMP composite are computed making a thin plate theory assumption, which takes into account the transverse shear deformations. The possible elastic couplings for SMF-SMP laminates are discussed, and the laminate force and moment resultants are computed for various laminate configurations. The analysis takes into account the effects of phase transformations and the resulting change in the fiber-matrix modulus. The results have been compared by considering different fiber volume fractions, temperatures, fiber orientations, and lamina stacking sequences. The results show that adaptive SMA-SMP composites laminates can be developed that provide shape controllability via tunable laminate stiffnesses leading to optimal response. Furthermore, the work presents the necessary framework for a reliable and efficient analysis of SMA-SMP laminates for practical applications. The theory can be directly used in established plate and shell formulations of finite element analysis. Finally, the variations in force and moment resultants with respect to fiber orientations and stacking sequences are presented, which are useful to study the bending and buckling characteristics of active composites for shape control of adaptive structures. The work concludes that efficient adaptive laminate development for high performance composite applications, exhibiting large shape adaptivity, high stresses, and increased stiffness, are feasible as compared to SMA composites without active matrix.

          "abstract": "This chapter compares the theoretical predictions published in Part A of the failure exercise, with the experimental results and discusses how modifications can be introduced to obtain better fit between the theoretical and experimental results. The theoretical results presented by Gotsis et al. are compared with those of the other models used by ten different groups who participated in the failure exercise. All these groups used the same input data to analyze the same 14 test problems. Two computer codes, Integrated Composite Analyzer (ICAN) and Composite Durability Structural Analyzer (CODSTRAN), are applied to predict the damage initiation, damage growth, and global structural fracture in a wide range of multidirectional laminates. ICAN is only capable of predicting the initiation of damage in a lamina or a laminate while CODSTRAN is capable of predicting the progression of damage in any composite structure. It is employed to predict seven biaxial failure envelopes of [0??] unidirectional and [0??/ ?? 45??/90??]&lt;inf&gt;s&lt;/inf&gt;, [ ?? 0??/90??]&lt;inf&gt;s&lt;/inf&gt;, and [ ?? 55??]&lt;inf&gt;s&lt;/inf&gt; multilayered composite laminates.

In general, CODSTRAN gave reasonable predictions for cases where final failure is dominated by fiber fracture. There is, however, large discrepancy between the predicted and measured failure strengths and strains for cases where failure is dominated by matrix failure. Some of the discrepancy is attributed to the effect of residual matrix stiffness that is discounted in the simulations and sensitivity of the specimens to the presence of biaxial stress state in certain cases.",

A recently developed p-version finite element, which follows third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT), is employed. Large deflections are considered, hence, the analysis is in the geometrically non-linear regime. To predict damage onset, Tsai-Wu criterion and an associated damage onset index, described in this paper as a safety factor, are used.

Thus, the complex process and state of delamination damage can be simulated practically with high efficiency for both analysis and modeling. Based on the self-adapting delamination method, linear dy-namic finite element damage analysis is performed to simulate the low-velocity impact damage process of three types of mixed woven composite laminates. Taking the frictional force among sublaminations during delaminating and the transverse normal stress into account, the analytical results are consistent with those of the experimental data.",

          "abstract": "The electro-mechanical response (Electrical Resistance Change method) as a damage index of quasi-isotropic Carbon Fiber Reinforced (CFRPs) laminates under fatigue loading was investigated. The effect of dispersed Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) into the epoxy matrix was additionally evaluated and compared with neat epoxy CFRPs. The longitudinal resistance change of the specimens was monitored throughout the fatigue experiment. Three different stress levels were tested. The frequency and the ratio (R) of the minimum applied load (stress) to the maximum applied load (stress) were kept constant for the different stress levels. The temperature of the specimen was also monitored throughout the process in order to deduce its effect on the electrical resistance of the specimen. The electrical behavior of the quasi-isotropic CFRP deviated from the commonly observed electrical response of unidirectional or cross-ply CFRPs due to the presence of the 45?? layers. During initial stages of loading the resistance drops and afterwards it follows a positive slope up to final fracture. This repeatable pattern was observed for both the neat and the CNT-doped specimens, with the latter having smoother electrical recordings. The effect of temperature was calculated to be limited for the specific material and test/measurement configuration. The electro-mechanical response was correlated to stiffness degradation and acoustic emission findings enabling the identification of the specific regions during the fatigue life referring to specific mechanisms of damage accumulation. More specifically the experimental results revealed that the occurrence of the initial drop of the electrical resistance is linked with the occurrence of the Characteristic Damage State (CDS), associated with a specific percentage of stiffness reduction. This finding was used in order to predict the remaining life independently from the applied stress level with a high degree of confidence, assuming a constant stress level throughout the whole lifetime. The remaining life prediction for the CNT-doped specimens had higher coefficient of confidence (R2). ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The use of different resin systems is considered so that potentially complex and expensive fibre treatments are avoided. The resin systems used include a polyester, a vinyl ester and an epoxy. Laminates of 15%, 22.5% and 30% fibre volume fraction were manufactured by resin transfer moulding. The laminates were tested for strength and modulus under tensile and flexural loading. Additionally, tests were carried out on laminates to determine the impact energy, impact strength and water absorption. The results revealed that properties were affected in markedly different ways by the resin system and the fibre volume fraction. Polyester laminates showed good modulus and impact properties, epoxy laminates displayed good strength values and vinyl ester laminates exhibited good water absorption characteristics. Scanning electron microscope studies show that epoxy laminates fail by fibre fracture, polyester laminates by fibre pull-out and vinyl ester laminates by a combination of the two. A comparison between kenaf and glass laminates revealed that the specific tensile and flexural moduli of both laminates are comparable at the volume fraction of 15%. However, glass laminates have much better specific properties than the kenaf laminates at high fibre volume fractions for all three resins used. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

They offer large potential for application in primary structures as they give excellent performance at low production costs. However, before NCF composites will be efficiently used in design, detailed understanding of governing micro mechanisms must be accumulated and described by predictive models. In the present study, NCF cross-ply laminates have been tested in tension. Intralaminar cracks caused in the 90?? fibre bundle layers and their effect on laminate mechanical properties have been monitored. Occurrence of &#039;novel&#039; type of cracks propagating in the load direction (longitudinal cracks) is explained by a thorough FE analysis using an Representative Volume Element (RVE) approach, revealing stress concentrations caused by 0?? fibre bundle waviness. Effects of damage on mechanical properties are modelled using modified micro mechanical models developed for analysis of conventional laminated composites. The analysis reveals mechanical degradation to be ruled by the crack opening displacement (COD). However, unlike traditional composites, transverse cracks do not generally extend through the entire thickness of the 90?? layer, but are rather contained in single fibre bundles, limiting the COD. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A serial of impact tests was performed with different thicknesses of narrow CFRP laminates to examine the damage process and extent from initiation to complete breakage. The quasi-static three-point bending tests were carried out to characterize the degradation of residual flexural properties induced by the impact. The overall impact energies are clearly separated into three regions by the penetration threshold and crack threshold respectively determined by the EPD. The main damage modes are matrix cracking for lower impact energies, delamination and fiber breakage for middle impact energies and complete breakage for higher impact energies. It is also found that the degradation of normalized residual flexural properties can be divided into three regions using these abovementioned two thresholds, of which the greatest loss occurs in the middle energy region, whilst the maximum reductions of normalized flexural strength and flexural modulus are smaller than 20% in the first region. By comparison, the 6-ply specimens are of lower impact resistance and lower residual flexural properties than the 9-ply specimens under same impact energy; and the residual flexural strength is more sensitive to impact loading than flexural modulus. ?? 2014.",

An elastoplastic damage model was developed to describe the behavior of these structures in the greatest detail possible. The damage is modeled on each elementary constituent. Then a complete model at meso (intermediate) scale is obtained by applying a homogenization method. This model takes into account the transverse tensile and shear damage of matrix and fibre - Matrix interface, as well as the nonlinear behavior of the fibre under axial compression. Plasticity develops only in the matrix and its flow is blocked in the direction of the fibres. It is modeled by an anisotropic yield criterion (of the HILL type) which takes not only the transverse and shear stress into account but which also includes isotropic and nonlinear kinematic hardening. The model developed was included in the nonlinear finite element &quot;Castem 2000&quot; to allow comparisons between numerical and experimental results. There is a good agreement between the simulated and experimental data. However, the model could advantageously be extended to take the phenomena such as viscoplasticity into account. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Experimental and finite element study is carried out to understand the damage propagation and ultimate strength of scarf patch repaired CFRP laminates under uni-axial tensile load here. The ultimate strength and damage propagation in scarf repaired laminates has been investigated with respect to change in scarf angle and patch diameter. It is revealed from the results that damage is initiated in adhesive film at the bonded interface of 0?? plies of parent laminate and patch in and then propagates in circumferential direction around scarf patch. It is found that some damage occurs in the parent laminate before the damage initiation in the adhesive film. After the adhesive film failure, the damage in parent laminate quickly propagates transversely to the free edge sides of the laminate and failure occurs. The results of this investigation provide further insight into the damage mechanisms in scarf repairs of composite structures under tensile load.

It is shown that, in T300/914 material, the important development of large amounts of damage enables the material to accommodate efficiently overstresses which are present near the hole. In the APC-2 composite, the presence of scarce damage and plastic strains very close to the hole is less efficient for accommodating overstresses.

This paper discusses the influence of the forming pressure and coupler concentration on the mechanical behavior of glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composite laminates. The Design of Experiments’ (DOE) full factorial approach was adopted for conducting the composite laminate fabrication experiments. The thermoplastic composite laminates were fabricated in a hot compression molding machine, using the film stacking technique. This is an innovative approach to develop thermoplastic composite laminates, using the available low cost raw materials, instead of high end prepreg materials. As per the ASTM standard, the tensile and flexural tests were carried out, in order to evaluate the influence of the parameters on the mechanical behavior of the composite laminates. The Tensile and flexural strengths of the thermoplastic composite laminates were the responses measured to identify the most influencing parameter. The experimental results show that the increase in forming pressure and coupler concentration initially increases both the mechanical properties, and then decreases the properties of the composite laminates. Compared to the coupler concentration, the forming pressure greatly improves both the tensile and flexural properties. Using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), a morphological analysis was carried out to observe the bonding between the matrix and reinforcement.",

          "abstract": "Low-velocity impact damage to composite laminates causes a complicated pattern of matrix cracks, fibre cracks and delamination. A significant effect of this damage is to reduce the strength of the laminate, particularly in compression; however, owing to the complexity of the damage the precise mechanisms controlling the strength reduction are unclear. In this paper a technique is described for replicating impact damage artificially by including PTFE film delaminants and cut plies during lay-up. Comparisons between real and artificially reproduced damage are made to demonstrate the validity of the technique. Experimental methods of X-radiography and resin injection are developed to allow the mechanisms controlling strength reduction to be assessed, both under tensile and compressive loading. Under tensile load the reduction in strength caused by impact damage is found to be entirely due to fibre cracks and may be estimated by using a net-section calculation. Meanwhile under compression, strength reduction is largely caused by the redistribution of stress resulting from buckling of delaminated plies and may be predicted by calculating stresses in the undelaminated part of the laminate.",

          "abstract": "Fiber Metal Laminates are a class of materials that have a promising future in aerospace, the combination of metal and composite layers gives excellent properties. One aspect under investigation is the forming of these laminates. The prediction of the forming limits of Fiber Metal Laminates differs from that of normal monolitical sheet due to the complex stress distribution and the multiple failure modes. One of the failure mechanisms of Fiber Metal Laminates is the interlaminar shear failure. This failure occurs when the shear stress in a layer or an interface of the laminates exceeds its maximum. For the understanding of this phenomenon three point bending tests were performed on Glare® laminates and other laminates. The results show that there are different failure modes depending on the process parameters and the laminate composition. It was concluded that the interlaminar shear failure not only depends on the shear force but also on the bending moment. The results of this research are used in the brake forming process to avoid interlaminar shear failure.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a robust framework for computational modelling of the response of composite laminates to blast loads. The numerical test-bed for the simulations is the explicit finite element code, LS-DYNA. Delaminations are modelled using a cohesive type tie-break interface introduced between sublaminates while intra-laminar damage mechanisms are captured using a continuum damage mechanics approach. In the latter case, a non-local regularization scheme is proposed in order to address the spurious mesh dependency and mesh orientation problems that occur with all smeared crack based constitutive models. The preliminary results for the predicted damage patterns are encouraging and qualitatively agree with the measurements obtained from sectioned post-mortem panels.",

In order to develop the model, results from a previous experimental study that investigated compression failure mechanisms in special ‘uniply’ composite laminates were used as motivation. The FEA model and geometry were defined based on these experimental results that showed failure to initiate in the form of a narrow kink band near the hole edge and to be confined in extent to a distance within one half of the hole radius. A finite size rectangular region adjacent to the cutout edge corresponding in size to the area in which the kink banding occurs is analyzed. The values of boundary loads on this rectangular region that correspond to kink banding is related to the far-field loading on the boundaries of the specimen via an available closed form analysis for orthotropic laminates. Good agreement is reported between experiment and analysis.",

This system can send and receive broadband Lamb waves efficiently in a specific direction, and the MFCs and FBGs can be integrated into composite laminates because of their flexibility and high fracture strain. In this research, this system was applied to detect an interlaminar delamination in carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates. One MFC and one FBG were bonded on each surface of the CFRP laminate to generate and receive the symmetric modes and the anti-symmetric modes separately for identification of the multiple modes of Lamb waves in the laminate. Then we investigated the mode conversion of Lamb waves at both tips of a delamination in the middle of the thickness of the lamimate, through an experiment and finite element analysis (FEA). On the basis of the knowledge about the mode conversion, an index to evaluate the delamination length was proposed using velocity changes by the mode conversions. From the results of experiments and FEA for the laminates with an artificial delamination, this new index was found to be effective to evaluate the delamination progress in the laminate quantitatively.",

The effects of interfacial microstructure on debone and friction strengths are also discussed using results from fiber push-out tests. Fatigue damage initiation and propagation mechanisms are elucidated via optical/scanning electron microscopy and acoustic emission analysis of specimens that were deformed to failure in incremental cyclic loading steps. The effects of cyclic deformation on matrix hardness and composite modulus are also examined prior to the presentation of a fracture mechanics (micromechanics) approach for the prediction of fatigue life, and the effects of crack-tip shielding via bridging mechanisms. The paper highlights the potential for the development of accurate life prediction methodologies that are based on experimental observations of damage in titanium matrix composites.

To aid in this goal surrogate or “dummy” AFC (DAFC) using a composite core and Kapton® outer layers (to match the longitudinal mechanical and interface properties of the AFC) were employed. These DAFC were used in place of real AFC to expedite test specimen manufacture and evaluation. This allowed efficient investigation of the impact of an integrated AFC-like inclusion on laminate mechanical integrity. Laminates with integrated AFC were additionally tested with signal monitoring to assess AFC health during the test. Investigation into laminate failure was accomplished via a finite element model of the system which was created in ANSYS to investigate failure in the composite plies. Tsai-Wu failure criterion was calculated to investigate laminate failure characteristics. Integration of AFC into CFRP laminates degraded laminate strength by 13.3% using insertion integration and 7.8% using the interlacing integration technique. The finite element model showed that interlacing integration enabled distribution of critical forces over the entire laminate while insertion integration led to critical forces concentrating over the integration region.",

          "abstract": "Piezoelectric fiber composite sensors (PFCSs) made from micro-sized lead zirconate titanate (PZT) fibers have many advantages over the traditional bulk PZT sensors for embedded sensor applications. PFCSs as embedded sensors will be an ideal choice to continuously monitor the stress/strain levels and health conditions of composite structures. PFCSs are highly flexible, easily embeddable, have high compatibility with composite structures, and also provides manufacturing flexibility. This research is focused on examining the effects of embedding PFCS sensors (macro-fiber composite (MFC) and piezoelectric fiber composite (PFC)) on the structural integrity of glass-fiber-epoxy composite laminates. The strengths of composite materials with embedded PFCSs and conventional PZT sensors were compared, and the advantages of PFCS sensors over PZTs were demonstrated. Initially a numerical simulation study is performed to understand the local stress/strain field near the embedded sensor region inside a composite specimen. High stress concentration regions were observed near the embedded sensor corner edge. Using PFCS leads to a reduction of 56% in longitudinal stress concentration and 38% in transverse stress concentration, when compared to using the conventional PZTs as embedded sensors. In-plane tensile, in-plane tension-tension fatigue, and short beam strength tests are performed to evaluate the strengths/behavior of the composite specimens containing embedded PFCS. From the tensile test it is observed that embedding PFCS and PZT sensors in the composite structures leads to a reduction in ultimate strength by 3 and 6% respectively. From the fatigue test results it is concluded that both embedded PFCS and PZT sensors do not have a significant effect on the fatigue behavior of the composite specimens. From the short beam strength test it is found that embedding PFCS and PZT sensors leads to a reduction in shear strength by 7 and 15% respectively. Overall the pure PZT sensors seem to have low compatibility with composites when compared to PFCSs.",

          "abstract": "This paper represents the continuation of our research on built-in piezoelectric sensor for structural health monitoring of composite materials. Experimental research is focused on examining the effects of the embedded sensors on the structural integrity of composite laminates subjected to mechanical tests. A series of composite specimens with and without embedded sensor are tested in fatigue loading while constantly monitoring the response by acoustic emission technique. The acoustic signals are analysed using the classification k-means method in order to identify the different damage mechanisms and to follow the evolution of these mechanisms for both types of composite materials (with and without sensor). The mechanical behaviour of composites with and without embedded sensor shows no difference in the form. The incorporation of piezoelectric sensor causes low degradation of mechanical properties of composites. Comparing embedded sensor to sensor mounted on the surface, the embedded sensor showed a much higher sensitivity. It is thus verified that the embedded acoustic emission sensor had great potential for acoustic emission monitoring in fibre reinforced composite structures.",

This paper focuses on the experimental characterization of the damage resistance of laminates made from T800/3900-2 carbon/epoxy tape material to impact by high velocity ice spheres, i.e., simulated hail ice (SHI). The failure threshold energy (FTE) defining the onset of damage was found for three panel thicknesses (1.59, 3.11, and 4.66 mm), each impacted by three ice diameters (38.1, 50.8, and 61.0 mm). Non-destructive investigation techniques were used to detect, map, and characterize the delaminated area. A regression analysis was used to quantitatively determine the FTE of the tape laminates, which was found to closely match previous woven carbon/epoxy FTE data. Both data sets were found to exhibit a linear and common relationship to the ratio of panel thickness to ice diameter (H/D). The resulting delamination patterns of the current and previous panels were found to be similar at damage initiation, but to differ for higher damage states. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is based on the concepts of continuum damage mechanics. Since the material macroscopic thermo-mechanical response under large strain and high strain rate deformation loading is governed by different physical mechanisms, a multi-dissipative approach is proposed. It incorporates thermo-mechanical coupling effects as well as internal dissipative mechanisms through rate-dependent constitutive relations with a set of internal variables. In addition, the effect of stress triaxiality on the onset and evolution of plastic flow, damage and failure is discussed. Furthermore, the algorithm for numerical integration of the coupled constitutive rate equations is presented. It relies on operator split methodology resulting in an inelastic predictor-elastic corrector technique. The explicit finite element program LS-DYNA augmented by an user-defined material subroutine is used to approximate boundary-value problems under dynamic loading conditions. Numerical simulations of dynamic experiments with different specimens are performed and good correlation of numerical results and published experimental data is achieved. Based on numerical studies modified specimens geometries are proposed to be able to detect complex damage and failure mechanisms in Hopkinson-Bar experiments. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Indenters with various shapes and sizes were used in this study. For line-type Charpy indenters, the effect of angles between indenter and fiber were also investigated. Both the nondestructive ultrasonic and mechanical sectioning techniques were used to evaluate impact damage in the laminates. The results showed that cross-ply Glare 3 FML’s offer higher impact resistance than unidirectional Glare 2 FML’s. The first failure at low-velocity impact occurred as delamination between the non-impacted side aluminum face-sheet and the adjacent fiber-epoxy layer. It followed by a visible crack in the outer aluminum face-sheet at the non-impacted side with a crack length increasing with the higher impact energy. The more severe local damages appeared with smaller indenters whereas larger global deflection occurred if larger size indenters were used. This implies that for fiber-metal laminates impacted by smaller size indenters, the energy dissipated mainly through delamination and cracks whereas for their counterparts impacted by larger size indenters, more energy may be absorbed due to large global deformation.",

However, due to the expensive and time-consuming nature of variable-amplitude experiments, their effect is often assessed by performing block loading experiments with various low-high and high-low sequences. In this article, the effects of load sequence and block loading on the fatigue damage development in fiber-reinforced polymer composites is investigated. First it is shown that the opinions in the open literature on the damaging effect of low-high and high-low load sequences are divided. Next the effect of block loading on the bending fatigue behavior of composites is experimentally tested and numerically simulated with a newly developed fatigue damage model. Finally, numerical simulations show that the transitions from low to high stress levels are the most damaging, and that the number of transitions and their relative importance in particular determine which block loading sequence (low-high or high-low) is the most devastating.",

In this study, two different fiber materials, namely, E-glass and carbon, with different architecture are chosen.

These composites were subjected to quasi-static and high strain rates of loading utilizing different testing methodologies. In quasi-static testing, the tensile, compressive and shear properties were studied using existing ASTM standard testing procedures and the results are reported. The carbon composite showed higher tensile and compressive modulus. In-plane shear properties of both the composites were comparable and inter laminar shear properties of E-glass composites were observed to be better than the carbon composite because of the better nesting between the E-glass fabric layers. A shock tube and a controlled explosion tube were utilized in the study of dynamic damage behavior of these composite materials.

The proposed effective yield criterion, in conjunction with the assumed overall associative plastic flow rule and hardening law, provides analytical foundation for the estimation of effective elastoplastic behavior of ductile matrix composites.

          "abstract": "A numerical flow-compaction model is developed and implemented in a Þnite element code to simulate the multiple physical phenomena involved during the autoclave processing of Þbre-reinforced composite laminates. The model is based on the eective stress formulation coupled with a Darcian ßow theory. A Galerkin approach is employed to discretize the weak form of the governing equations. The current formulation successfully describes the compaction behaviour of complex shape laminates caused by ßow of the resin. A parametric study is performed to investigate the eect of the material properties on the compaction of angle-shaped composite laminates. It is found that the Þbre bed shear modulus signiÞcantly aects the compaction behaviour in the corner sections of curved laminates while the resin viscosity and Þbre bed permeability aect the compaction rate of the laminate.

          "abstract": "High-temperature creep behavior of symmetric angle-ply laminates made of unidirectional T800H/3631 carbon/epoxy composite is examined at relatively high stress levels. Constant-stress creep tests in tension are performed at 100 ??C for 5 h on plain coupon specimens of three types of angle-ply laminates [??30]3S [??45]3S and [??60]3S under load control conditions. For each angle-ply laminate, creep tests are carried out at three different stress levels. Creep strain recovery following the 5-h creep is also observed for 5 h at the same temperature, after completely removing the creep stress. Creep responses are clearly observed in all kinds of angle-ply laminates. The creep strain rate in the angle-ply laminates tends to rapidly disappear as the creep strain increases. The transient creep is thus dominant in the angle-ply laminates, regardless of the fiber orientations. The prior creep strain does not completely recover with time after removing the creep stress, which indicates certain inelastic mechanisms have operated with creep. Similar features are also observed for the off-axis creep behavior of the unidirectional laminates of the same composite system. A whole history consisting of the prior instantaneous elastoviscoplastic behavior at a constant strain rate and the subsequent creep response at a constant stress level is simulated using the classical laminated plate theory and a phenomenological viscoplasticity model for individual plies. Material constants involved by the ply viscoplasticity model are identified on the basis of the off-axis creep behavior for unidirectional laminates. It is demonstrated that excellent agreements between the predicted and observed results are obtained by additionally taking into account the fiber rotation induced by deformation. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, bagasse fiber has been used as reinforcing component for unsaturated polyester resin (USP) to open up further possibilities in waste management.

The effect of different fiber treatment and the fiber content on the composite properties were investigated. At different fiber loadings, AA treated fiber composites shows better mechanical properties compared to those of NaOH treated fiber composites. SEM investigations show that the surface modifications improve the fiber-matrix interaction. Moreover, the storage modulus of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) indicated that NaOH and AA treated fibers based composites enhance the storage modulus of the composites. From water absorption study, it was observed that the treated fiber composites show lower water absorption properties compared to those of untreated fiber based composites. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model is implemented into the Finite Element (FE) code ABAQUS/Explicit for one-integration point solid elements and validated against low velocity impact experimental results. Mesh-regularisation of the impact results is one of the greatest challenges in impact damage modelling of composite targets. Currently published mesh-regularisation strategies can produce mesh-size-independent impact results for a very limited range of mesh-sizes. The originality of the model presented in this paper is based on a novel mesh-regularisation strategy, which is applicable to predicting mesh-size-independent impact results for any target discretisation. Accurate modelling of composites’ impact damage using a relatively coarse mesh, and thus at a much reduced computational cost when compared to existing techniques, can be achieved with the proposed method.",

          "abstract": "High performance composite materials, such as Carbon-Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) composites, are being increasingly used in aerospace industry, such as fuselage primary structures in Boeing 787 or Airbus 350, where high strength and stiffness are required at minimum weight [1]. The design of composite structures frequently includes discontinuities such as cut-outs for access and fastener holes for joining and they become critical regions under thermo-mechanical loading. Understanding of notched specimen behaviour is necessary for the design of complex structures where parts are mostly connected with bolts and rivets [2]. The effect of these discontinuities on the behaviour of composite materials is an important topic because it causes a relatively large reduction in strength compared to the unnotched laminate [3]. In the first part of the current work, the assessment of the damage process taking place in notched (open-hole) specimens under uniaxial tensile loading was studied. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) Digital Image Correlation (DIC) techniques were employed to obtain full-field surface strain measurements in carbon-fibre/epoxy M21/T700 composite plates with different stacking sequences in the presence of an open circular hole. Penetrant enhanced X-ray radiographs were taken to identify damage location and extent after loading around the hole. DIC strain fields were compared to numerical predictions. In the second part of the study, DIC techniques were used to characterise damage and performance of adhesively bonded patch repairs in composite panels under tensile loading. This part of work relates to strength/stiffness restoration of damaged composite aircraft that becomes more important as composites are used more extensively in the construction of modern jet airliners. In the current work, external bonded patches have been studied. Adhesively bonded repairs are the most common type of repair carried out with composite materials [1,4]. The behaviour of bonded patches under loading was monitored using DIC full-field strain measurements. Location and extent of damage identified by X-ray radiography correlates well with DIC strain results giving confidence to the technique for structural health monitoring of bonded patches. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to understand the specific damage behavior of such materials under severe environmental conditions, AE analysis was accompanied by microscopic observations to detect the damage initiation threshold as well as the damage mechanisms within the composite material. Once the AE source mechanisms have been separated into classes thanks to the pattern recognition software Noesis, they have been identified to match physical phenomena. Earliest cracks events occur at the crimps where the rotation of warp/weft fibres takes place, followed by the intra-bundles splitting on free surface. It is observed that the onset of intralaminar cracking and debonding is affected by the presence of matrix-rich regions between the plies, because of an extensive plasticization of the PPS matrix. The study of the specific acoustic activity of neat PPS resin specimens confirms that the local plastic deformation in matrix-rich areas contributes to delay the initiation of damage, and subsequent AE signals. Finally, AE proved to be a relevant technique to investigate damage mechanisms and to determine accurately the damage threshold in TP-based composites to be used in aeronautical applications at T &gt; Tg. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The response of hybrid composites to low-velocity impact loading has been investigated. The energy absorbing mechanisms of laminates containing various fibers were studied primarily by means of the instrumented falling dart impact testing technique. Static indentation tests and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were also employed to assist in the identification of failure mechanisms. The composites containing polyethylene (PE) fibers, which were of high strength and high ductility, were found to be effective in both dissipating impact energy and resisting through penetration. Polyester (PET) fiber reinforced epoxy also exhibited superior impact characteristics even though the PET fabric layers without epoxy did not have good modulus or ductility. Good energy absorbing capability was also observed in epoxy reinforced with woven fabrics made of high-performance Nylon fibers. Nylon, PE and PET fibers were found to enhance the impact resistance of graphite fiber composites. Upon impact loading, the composites containing either PE or PET fibers in general exhibited a great degree of flexural plastic deformation and some level of delamination, thereby dissipating a significant amount of strain energy. Hybrids containing Nylon fabric showed analogous behavior, but to a lesser degree. The stacking sequence in hybrid laminates was found to play a critical role in controlling plastic deformation and delamination. This implies that the stacking sequence is a major factor governing the overall energy sorbing capability of the hybrid structure. The penetration resistance of hybrid composites appeared to be dictated by the toughness (strength plus ductility) of their constituent fibers. The fiber toughness must be measured under high strain rate conditions. ?? 1989.",

          "abstract": "Alumina fiber (ALF)/epoxy composites are possible candidates for the structural components of superconducting magnets because of their low thermal conductivity in addition to their higher specific strength and modulus. Since laminate structures are applied to the load support system for superconducting magnets, the evaluation of interlaminar strength both under static and fatigue loadings is essential from the view point of structural integrity. In the present study, mode I and II interlaminar fracture toughness and delamination fatigue crack growth behavior were investigated with unidirectional ALF/epoxy laminates using double cantilever beam specimens and end notched flexure specimens both with a special loading device. The fracture toughness values and the fatigue crack growth resistance of ALF/epoxy laminates were higher than those of CF/epoxy laminates with similar matrices. The analysis of the stress-ratio dependency showed that the contribution of the maximum stress was higher for ALF/epoxy than that for CF/epoxy laminates. The fractographic observation indicated that the interfacial fracture was dominant on the fracture surfaces of fatigue fracture, suggesting that the microscopic mechanism was different from that of CF/epoxy laminates.",

The strain-rate sensitivity of composite samples at 4% strain, tested parallel and normal to the plane of reinforcement, was found to be higher than that of unreinforced alloy in the strain-rate range studied. Quantitative analysis of fiber fragment lengths from samples tested to different strain levels showed that, at small strains, high strain-rate testing induced a relatively shorter fiber fragment length distribution in the composite compared to quasi-static testing. At quasi-static strain rates, the fiber strengthening effect was found to increase with increasing Vf% and was higher in samples tested parallel to the planar random array. The observed anisotropy of the composite at quasi-static strain rates was also observed to continue into the high strain-rate regime. Microscopic observations on composite samples tested quasi-statically and dynamically to a range of strains showed that the major damage process involved during compression testing was fiber breakage followed by the microcracking of the matrix at relatively large strains. Fiber breakage modes were found to be mostly shearing and buckling.",

To date, several optimization methods have been introduced to solve this challenging problem, which is often non-linear, non-convex, multimodal, and multidimensional, and might be expressed by both discrete and continuous variables. These optimization techniques can be studied in two parts: constant stiffness design and variable stiffness designs.

The position as well as the strain field ahead of the crack tip during the loading stage was determined using a digital speckle photogrammetry system. The limitation on the applicability of the standard data reduction schemes for the determination of intralaminar toughness of composite materials is presented and discussed.

The method accounts for material anisotropy and finite specimen dimension effects regardless of the geometry. The approach has been validated for alternative non-standard specimen geometries. A comparison between different methods currently available for computing the intralaminar fracture toughness in composite laminates is presented and a good agreement between numerical and experimental results using the proposed methodology was obtained. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Variation of the fiber orientation angle as a function of the position in the panel results in a composite laminate with stiffness properties that are functions of the panel coordinates.

The fiber orientation is assumed to vary only in one spatial direction, although the analysis can be extended to fiber orientations that vary in two spatial directions. The Ritz Method has been used to find the buckling loads and buckling modes for the variable stiffness panels for two different cases. In one of the cases the fiber orientation is assumed to change in the direction of the applied load. The other case is the one in which the fiber orientation varies in a direction perpendicular to the loading direction. Improvements in the buckling load of up to 80% over straight fiber configurations were found. Results for three different panel aspect ratios are presented.",

          "abstract": "It is desirable in composite helicopter blades ,  airframes ,  and fuselage to detect incipient material damage and track the growth of structural damage as the aircraft undergoes rotordynamic and structural loading . In this paper ,  damage in composites is identified using vibration measurements to detect the presence of modulation between the low-frequency harmonic vibration response that is excited by the rotordynamics and the high-frequency acoustic response that is excited by a ceramic actuator . The hypothesis is that modulation between these two forced response components occurs if the composite material is damaged because the damage introduces nonlinear stiffness or damping restoring forces . For example ,  a delamination will produce clapping ,  buckling ,  or rubbing of the composite material when it is loaded depending on the direction and frequency range of the static and dynamic loads . One merit of this proposed approach for detecting incipient damage is that the low-frequency vibration is of sufficient energy to &quot;pump&quot; the composite structure to stress the damaged region whereas the high-frequency acoustic waves are of small enough wavelength to &quot;probe&quot; the structure to detect the damage . In addition ,  this approach to composite damage detection would ideally not be affected by the complexity of the composite structure ( geometry ,  material configuration - sandwich ,  stiffened laminate ,  etc. ) or variability in the operating regime of the aircraft . In order to determine the feasibility of using this damage detection method on military aircraft ,  experimental testing was conducted on a similar carbon fiber composite material to what is used on modern military helicopter structural components .

The particular model studied consists of a double cantilever beam (DCB) in which voids are placed ahead of the crack tip and the Mode I Strain Energy Release Rate (SERR) is calculated. The standard beam-on-elastic-foundation theory is modified to account for shear compliance and material orthotropy, and the new formulation is used to evaluate the deformed shape, elastic deformation energy and SERR. The presence of the voids is simulated as an unsupported zone in the elastic-foundation. The validation of the new analytical model, in terms of the deformed shapes and SERR values, is successfully carried out by suitable 2D finite element (FE) analyses. The effect of size, location and shape of the voids is investigated by a parametric study that showed that the enhancement of SERR increases with the size of the voids and the proximity to the crack tip and that elongated (elliptical) voids are more critical than the circular voids. Finally, the influence of more complex void distributions on the fracture toughness is evaluated by FE analysis. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The tolerance of composites to damage induced by cyclic loading and moisture ingress is of utmost importance. This study highlights the effects of short-term cyclic moisture aging on the strength and fatigue performance of a glass/vinyl ester pultruded composite system. In particular, it addresses the change in quasi-static properties and tension-tension (R = 0.1) fatigue behavior of a commercial glass/vinyl ester system in fresh and salt water. The quasi-static tensile strength was seen to reduce by 24% at a moisture concentration of 1% by weight. This reduction in strength was not recoverable even when the material was dried, suggesting that the exposure to moisture caused permanent damage in the material system. Even though the fatigue damage process of the unaged or `as-delivered&#039;, fresh-water- and salt-water-saturated material was similar, the cyclic moisture absorption-desorption experiments altered the fatigue performance of the composite system tested. Results were consistent with Mandell&#039;s postulate that fatigue failure in glass-fiber-reinforced polymeric composites is a fiber-dominated mechanism with a characteristic slope of 10% UTS/decade.",

Off-axis creep rupture data on plain coupon specimens are obtained within the time range up to 10 h for four kinds of off-axis fiber orientations. The log-log plots of the creep stress against the rupture time can approximately be described by straight lines with negative slopes over the range of creep life for all the fiber orientations. The static tensile strengths extrapolated from those straight lines almost agree with the experimental results for respective fiber orientations. The creep rupture data normalized with respect to the static strength approximately falls on a single creep rupture curve.

The creep fracture occurs along reinforcing fibers in a brittle manner without accompanying the appreciable secondary and tertiary creep stages, regardless of the fiber orientations, and thus the off-axis creep deformation prior to fracture is characterized by the primary creep stage for all the fiber orientations. Then, a phenomenological model for the creep deformation and rupture behaviors of the unidirectional composite is developed, with a view to making preliminary predictions of creep life from a limited amount of data. It is demonstrated that the proposed model can moderately describe the observed features of the creep deformation and creep rupture behaviors under off-axis loading conditions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Inherent in introducing CNTs into existing polymer-matrix composites are new multifunctional attributes such as significantly enhanced electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity that may be used for damage sensing and inspection. Here, fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix laminates with aligned CNTs grown in-situ are coupled with a non-invasive sensing scheme utilizing the enhanced electrical conductivity of the laminates to infer damage based on resistance changes. The laminates contain long (∼10 micron) aligned CNTs throughout the woven plies of the laminate, including at the ply interfaces. Electrodes are written onto the laminate surfaces using a direct-write process, and 3D damage inspection (in-plane and through-thickness) is demonstrated for impacted composite plates.

Currently the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test is being used for determining the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of unstitched and lightly stitched composite laminates. But the standard DCB test method is not suitable for laminates with medium to high density s titches. Due t o the high bending moment at the crack-tip, the specimens fail due to compressive stresses before the delamination could propagate. In order to overcome this limitation, a new fixture has been developed and used to perform Mode I fracture toughness tests on laminates with high density stitches. An analysis method has been developed to determine the load-deflection and the load-energy release rate relationships in the new test. The new test method has been found to be successful in testing graphite/epoxy laminates containing Kevlar stitches with a density of 64 stitches per square inch. The apparent fracture toughness of these specimens is about 45 times that of unstitched specimens.",

          "abstract": "There are inherent difficulties in the direct measurement of the thermal conductivity of fibers. The need to determine the thermal conductivity of fibers for design purposes has been the motivation of the present work. Four empirical formulas are developed to predict the thermal conductivities of fiberreinforced composite laminates (FRCLs) and their constituents. Two of these models utilize the parallel and series thermal models of composite walls in predicting the thermal conductivity of the fibers. The models are tested at different fiber-to-resin volume ratios (30/70, 45/55, 50/50, 60/40, and 75/25) and various fiber-to-resin thermal conductivity ratios (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). These ranges indicate the physically possible fiber to resin volume thermal conductivity ratios including the extreme possible cases. The effect of the air void volume ratio on the thermal conductivity of the composite laminates is investigated. The range of the investigated void fractions also represent the practical ranges. The predicted thermal conductivity of the fiber can be accurately predicted throughout the spectrum via three models. The first model is a first-order formula (R 2 = 0.9148) based on the parallel series structure of the constituents within the composite laminate. The second model is a second-order formula (R 2 = 0.9308) which is also based on the parallel series structure of the constituents. A third model is developed to predict the fiber thermal conductivity as a direct function of the composite thermal conductivity and other composite constituents and volume ratios. This correlation has a coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0.9632). A fourth model is developed to predict the effective thermal conductivity of the laminate. The effective thermal conductivity of the FRCL is predicted with very high accuracy (R 2 = 0.9948). Another use of these models is to determine the fiber to resin volume ratio or air void volume fraction (if all thermal conductivities of fiber, resin, and laminate are known).",

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0??/90??] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies. Predictions of residual velocity, development of deformation and delamination correlate well with experimental results. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The uniaxial fiber orientation provided property enhancement of the LNPC. The randomly oriented kenaf fibers, regardless of fiber contents in the laminates, provided an equal performance compared to the composites made of 25% fiber glass reinforced polyvinyl ester resin in the same laboratory processing conditions. Thermal properties of the laminates obtained from thermal gravimetry with differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) showed that the melting point (Tm) of the polypropylene (PP) film laminates decreased, and the crystallization peak increased as the kenaf fiber content in the laminates increased. The surface morphology results of the kenaf fiber and fractures of the laminates showed that some fibers pulled out from the matrix. The mechanical properties increased as the kenaf fiber content increased.

The present work is the first part of a study that investigates the effect of the drilling on the residual mechanical behavior of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) laminates when the hole is subjected to bearing load. In the first part, the influence of drilling parameters on the type and extension of the damage is analyzed. The damage is described at the macro level (delaminated area) and at the micro level (cracks, fiber-matrix debonding, etc.). The Design of Experiments and Analysis of Variance techniques are used in order to determine the statistical influence of the drilling parameters on the delamination area. Moreover, the effects of drilling with or without a support beneath the specimens are analyzed and discussed. Results indicate that the degree of peel-up delamination depends on the feed rate and on the helix angle of the twist drill. Push-down delamination is mainly affected by the feed rate, by the presence of support beneath the specimen, and by the twist drill temperature.",

Based on the analytical models from 1D and 3D moisture diffusion theories, the moisture diffusion coefficients are determined by the best least-square curve fitting to experimental data. Finite Element models are further developed, which subsequently validate the analytically obtained moisture diffusion coefficients.

AE energy results were found to correlate with damage indicated by ultrasonic C-scanning and microscopic inspection in terms of type, location and accumulation of damage and to provide indications of effective failure states before catastrophic failure. AE energy recorded along the gauge length indicated important critical intra and inter laminar damage occurring as early as 27% of ultimate tensile strength (UTS), typically 0.3% ultimate strain, for laminates with 90° layers. Considering these thresholds of significant AE as effective intermediate failure states suggests that the arbitrary choice of fatigue stress levels at a high percentage of UTS should be re-considered in order to avoid the destruction of relevant damage states in the first cycles of fatigue loading. Using relatively low stress levels as guided by the effective failure levels of static tests, blocked fatigue cycle tests provided AE energy data which could be extracted for each block type to reveal fatigue damage accumulation trends and effective fatigue failure states. It is therefore concluded that AE energy provides a valid and useful damage parameter and effective failure criteria for fatigue life prediction, accounting for the material’s current damage state, its response to variations in loading and effective intermediate failures.",

In order to evaluate these properties, the Split Cantilever Beam (SCB) fracture test is performed. The load is applied to a test specimen through a set of identical grips in order to reduce (in some degree) the mode II loading at the free edges. A three-dimensional finite element analysis is used to study the stress and strain state of the specimens and to interpret the experimental measurements. The strain energy release rate is calculated by using the virtual crack closure technique. It is found that the strain energy release rate is dominated by the mode III component. A non-uniform distribution of the strain energy release rate along the delamination front is obtained with mode III component having maximum at the center of the delamination front, while mode II component increases towards the free edges. The strain energy release rate is also determined using the crack closure technique. A finite element analysis is also carried out to calculate the stress intensity factors for the SCB specimens. The fracture surfaces are examined by scanning electron microscopy to identify the fracture mechanisms. The most important conclusion from the present study is that at temperature lowering from 293 to 20 K the mode III fracture toughness increases, further cooling to 4 K produces a toughness decrease.",

In our previous study, the conventional double cantilever beam (DCB) tests were performed to investigate the effects of temperature and fiber orientation in CFRP laminates. It was shown that G&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; was obviously affected by the temperature and fiber orientation. Especially, in case of the specimen with [45//-45] interface, G&lt;sub&gt;IR&lt;/sub&gt; was considerably affected by both failure mechanisms of crack jumping and fiber bridging. Therefore, in the present study, to suppress the effects of crack jumping and fiber bridging occurred in multidirectional laminates, the side notched double cantilever beam (SN-DCB) specimen is used. DCB tests of [22.5//-22.5] and [45//-45] SN-DCB specimens are conducted at three temperatures, that is, -100°C, 25°C and 150°C. G&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt; was affected by temperature and fiber orientation, obviously and slightly, respectively.

In transversely stitched composites, the delamination is not completely separated but is held together by the stitches. In this paper, the influence of stitching on the buckling of and delamination extension in laminates is examined on the assumption that the stitches follow a Winkler elastic foundation type of stress-separation relation. Delamination extension is governed by the Griffith fracture criterion in which the total elastic strain energy release rate, G, calculated from the sum of contributions from bending, axial compression, stitching and residual axial compression exceeds the fracture toughness, Gc, of the matrix material. It is shown that adequate stitching can significantly increase the strength of composite laminates under edgewise compression. ?? 1993.",

          "abstract": "The effect of the helical wood fiber structure on in-plane composite properties has been analyzed. The used analytical concentric cylinder model is valid for an arbitrary number of phases with monoclinic material properties in a global coordinate system. The wood fiber was modeled as a three concentric cylinder assembly with lumen in the middle followed by the S3, S2 and S1 layers. Due to its helical structure the fiber tends to rotate upon loading in axial direction. In most studies on the mechanical behavior of wood fiber composites this extension-twist coupling is overlooked since it is assumed that the fiber will be restricted from rotation within the composite. Therefore, two extreme cases, first modeling fiber then modeling composite were examined: (i) free rotation and (ii) no rotation of the cylinder assembly. It was found that longitudinal fiber modulus depending on the microfibril angle in S2 layer is very sensitive with respect to restrictions for fiber rotation. In-plane Poisson&#039;s ratio was also shown to be greatly influenced. The results were compared to a model representing the fiber by its cell wall and using classical laminate theory to model the fiber. It was found that longitudinal fiber modulus correlates quite well with results obtained with the concentric cylinder model, whereas Poisson&#039;s ratio gave unsatisfactory matching. Finally using typical thermoset resin properties the longitudinal modulus and Poisson&#039;s ratio of an aligned softwood fiber composite with varying fiber content were calculated for various microfibril angles in the S2 layer.

          "abstract": "A thermodynamically-based work poten- tial theory for modeling progressive damage and failure in fiber-reinforced laminates is presented. The cur- rent,multiple-internal state variable (ISV) formulation, referred to as enhanced Schapery theory, utilizes sep- arate ISVs for modeling the effects of damage and failure. Damage is considered to be the effect of any structural changes in a material that manifest as pre- peak non-linearity in the stress versus strain response. Conversely, failure is taken to be the effect of the evolu- tion of any mechanisms that results in post-peak strain softening, resulting in a negative tangent stiffness. It is assumed that matrix microdamage is the domi- nant damage mechanism in continuous fiber-reinforced polymer matrix laminates, and its evolution is con- trolled with a single ISV. Three additional ISVs are introduced to account for failure due to mode I trans- verse cracking, mode II transverse cracking, and mode I axial failure. Typically, failure evolution (i.e., post- peak strain softening characterized through a negative tangent stiffness) results in pathologically mesh depen- dent solutions within a finite element (FE) framework. Therefore, consistent characteristic lengths are intro- duced into the formulation to govern the evolution of the three failure ISVs. Using the stationarity of the total work potential with respect to each ISV, a set of thermodynamically consistent evolution equations for the ISVs are derived. The theory is implemented in association with the commercial FE software, Abaqus. Objectivity of total energy dissipated during the failure process, with regards to refinements in the FE mesh, is demonstrated. The model is also verified against experimental results from two laminated, T800/3900-2 panels containing a central notch and different fiber- orientation stacking sequences.Global load versus dis- placement, global load versus local strain gage data, and macroscopic failure paths obtained from the mod- els are compared against the experimental results. 1",

This test allows to identify material strength and/or toughness characteristics as well as to establish relation between damage level and the composite stiffness reduction. The transverse ply cracking is an inherently stochastic process due to the random variability of local material properties of the plies. The variability affects both crack initiation (governed by the local strength) and propagation (governed by the local fracture toughness). The primary aim of the present study is elucidation of the relative importance of these phenomena in the fragmentation process at different transverse and longitudinal ply thickness ratios. The effect of the random crack distribution on the mechanical properties reduction of the laminate is also considered. Transverse ply cracking in glass fiber/epoxy cross-ply laminates of the lay-ups [02/902]s, [0/902]s, and [0/904]s is studied. Several specimens of each lay-up were subjected to uniaxial quasistatic tension to obtain crack density as a function of applied strain. Crack spacing distributions at the edge of the specimen also were determined at a predefined applied strain. Statistical model of the cracking process is derived, calibrated using crack density vs. strain data, and verified against the measured crack spacing distributions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

At the first step, a representative element of the stiffened panel (superstiffener) is optimized using mathematical programming and lamination parameters subjected to combined loading (in-plane and out-of-plane) under strength (laminate or ply failure), buckling and practical design constraints. Ply blocking constraints are imposed at this step to improve convergence towards practical laminates. At the second step, the actual superstiffener’s laminates are obtained by using a genetic algorithm. Results, for the case considered, show that the inclusion of transverse shear effects has an associated 2.5% mass penalty and that neglecting its effects might invoke earlier buckling failure.

The mechanical performance of FRPCs is affected by multi-mechanism damage evolution under loading which in turn is affected by microstructural randomness in the material. Although the micro-scale fracture of a FRPC is a stochastic process, most analyses of these materials have treated them in a deterministic way. In this paper the effect of stochasticity in FRPCs is investigated through the application of cohesive zone elements in which random properties are introduced. These may be termed &#039;stochastic cohesive zone elements&#039; and are used in this paper to investigate the effect of microstructural randomness on the fracture behaviour of composite double cantilever beams. It is seen from this investigation that microstructure can significantly affect the macroscopic response of FRPC&#039;s, emphasising the need to account for microstructural randomness for accurate prediction of the performance of laminated composite structures. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A micromechanical analysis based on Eshelby inclusion theory and the Mori-Tanaka method has been performed. It is intended to evaluate the interfacial stress tensor by considering the local perturbation due to the onset and the growth of matrix microcracks. However, as developed previously, the interfacial degradation effects are modelled by using the damage participation rate. The latter is determined on the basis of an experimental damage methodology. This methodology is based on the amplitude treatments and microscope observations, which lead to an identification and a schematic classification of damage mechanisms. The model developed is then used to predict stiffness reduction and to simulate the behaviour of a composite with degraded interfaces and containing matrix microcracks. The model simulations agree well with experimental results, notably for the materials referred to as 600 tex and 1200 tex. Indeed, the simultaneous integration of matrix degradation and interfacial debonding has improved the numerical results because for these two materials the damage development is mainly governed by both failure processes as confirmed by the experimental findings. ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.",

The analysis of the experimental observations of the damage initiation and development is supported by finite element analysis. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Spectrophotometric experiments were performed on unidirectional and cross-ply glass fiber-reinforced polymer specimens with fiber volume fractions ranging from 0.20 to 0.45. Numerical ray-tracing analysis was used to investigate the experimentally observed wavelength dependency of the diffuse light transmittance. Refractive index mismatches between glass fibers and resin and the presence of air flaws in the laminates were the major parameters increasing light diffusion. Based on the experimental data, analytical models were developed to predict the translucency (haze) of glass fiber-reinforced polymer laminates as a function of the reinforcement weight and total light transmittance. The developed models demonstrate the feasibility of conceiving glass fiber-reinforced polymer skylights with a translucency of 0.90 and a total light transmittance of 0.50 for the daylighting of energy-efficient buildings. It is also shown that laminates with translucencies of lower than 0.30 satisfy minimum total transmittances of 0.83 as required for the encapsulation of photovoltaic cells.",

The first method assumes that the wrinkle length is very small and the pre-wrinkled state of the wrinkling layer is straight. During the forming process, each layer in the laminate is assumed to be under in-plane load as a consequence of the global bending of the laminate. The analysis shows that there are a set of loads under which the top layer may undergo wrinkling. The minimum of this load is the critical load, and there is a wrinkle length associated with this load. The wrinkling would take place only if the applied load is larger than the critical load. The second method is based upon the hypothesis that the wrinkling is triggered by the buckling of one layer experiencing maximum compression; remaining layers simply provide support to the unwrinkled part of the wrinkling layer. The analysis is performed using large-deflection theory and a variation in the potential energy of the wrinkle layer as a function of its perturbed states is used for predicting the formation of wrinkles.",

By means of finite element approach, the laminae stiffnesses are constructed independently from their interface, where a well-defined virtually zero-thickness interface element is discreetly adopted for delamination simulation. The present model has the advantage of simulating a localized interfacial condition at arbitrary locations, for various degeneration areas and intensities, under the influence of numerous boundary conditions since the interfacial description is expressed discretely. In comparison, the model shows good agreement with existing results from the literature when modeled in a perfectly bonded state. It is found that as the local delamination area increases, so does the magnitude of the maximum displacement history. Also, as top and bottom fiber orientations deviation increases, both central deflection and energy absorption increase although the relative maximum displacement correspondingly decreases when in contrast to the laminates perfectly bonded state.",

The formulation is implemented as a material model in Abaqus applicable to laminated composite plates and shells. Material defects are simulated by inserting an initial crack density in a small region of the specimen. Stress raisers are simulated by an open hole. The predictions are shown to be insensitive to mesh density. Further, damage localizes near stress raiser and material defects, thus numerically demonstrating the objectivity of the proposed model.

This is particularly true of the ply and laminate thickness, and hole diameter. Interrupted tests have been performed on open hole tensile specimens at different load levels to determine the progressive damage development, evaluated through non-destructive testing (X-ray and C-scanning). The tests were also analysed using a novel Finite Element Modelling technique. This was able to accurately predict the wide range of ultimate strengths measured with variation in test parameters, principally through incorporation of the sub-critical damage in the analysis. A significant damage mechanism was seen to be delamination at the hole edge which generally occurred at a lower stress for a smaller hole diameter to ply block thickness ratio. Delaminations allowed damage to join up through the thickness of the laminate and propagate. In ply-level scaled specimens, the delamination propagation was the ultimate failure mode of most of the specimens. In sub-laminate level scaled specimens, localised damage relieved stress in the 0?? fibres at the hole edge, delaying the onset of fibre failure. Less damage was seen for larger holes, thus leading to a decreasing failure stress with increasing hole diameter. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Recent studies have revealed that specimen size and material orthotropy has a major effect on the open hole tension (OHT) strength of composite laminates. The aim of this investigation is develop a progressive failure model for orthotropic composite laminates, employing stepwise discretization of the traction-separation relationship, to predict the effect of specimen size and laminate orthotropy on the OHT strength. The results show that a significant interaction exists between delamination and in-plane damage, so that models without considering delamination would over-predict strength. Furthermore, it is found that the increase in fracture toughness of blocked plies must be incorporated in the model to achieve good correlation with experimental results. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In developing such approach, stress analysis was conducted first for a 4. mm thick quasi-isotropic laminate to determine the potential failure modes and locations under the critical impact force. Three finite element models were subsequently built to simulate the damage in the upper, middle and lower interfaces and investigate the effect of each damage mode on the laminate stiffness. It is found that delamination adjacent to the impact point is suppressed by the high compressive through-thickness stress resulting in negligible reduction of the laminate stiffness. Both the delamination in interfaces adjacent to the mid-thickness plane and matrix fracture on the lower face can cause the first load drop, which corresponds to the critical impact force. The former is the main causative mechanism for the laminate studied in this paper. A simplified and efficient finite element model, which takes account of the delamination damage adjacent to the mid-thickness plane and the lower face, is developed that is computationally affordable and delivers acceptable prediction of the critical impact force, damage shape and size, by both quasi-static load and dynamic impact analyses.",

          "abstract": "This research aims at the high speed Mode I delamination characterisation of carbon Non Crimp Fabric composites (NCF) with and without through the thickness reinforcement. The dynamic delamination response under Mode I is investigated using visual and force measurements as well as numerical analysis to minimize errors due to the dynamics of this test. For loading speed larger than 3. m/s the double cantilever beam (DCB) is subjected to mixed Mode loading (Mode I/II). This result is inherent to the nature of the test and the impactor that introduced the load in the lower DCB arm. Numerical simulations show that this effect would also occur for UD laminates. Consequently the validity of the tests is limited to loading speeds below 3. m/s until which pure Mode I loading is achieved. For those loading rates optical analysis shows rate effects only at the crack initiation state which are stronger for the tufted interface. To avoid mixed mode effects at higher loading rates (&gt;3. m/s), the DCB specimen must be loaded at both arms simultaneously. Load cell recordings are not necessary as optical analysis is confirmed as a reliable technique for rate effect investigations. ?? 2012.",

The author&#039;s experiences are confined to the structures of transport aircraft; phase changes in metals and self-destruction of laminates during curing are not covered. Doing so would need additional material properties, and probably a different failure theory. SIFT does not cover environmental attack on the interface between fibers and resin; it covers only cohesive failures within the fibers or resin, or within a homogeneous piece of metal. In the SIFT model, each damage mechanism is characterized by its own critical value of a strain invariant. Each mechanism dominates its own portion of the strain domain; there is no interaction between them. Application of SIFT to metals is explained first. Fiber–polymer comp...",

CFRP tubes were compressed in a hydraulic press of 1000 kN loading capacity at very low-strain rate typical for static testing. The influence of the most important specimen geometric features such as the tube axial length, aspect ratio and wall thickness on the compressive response and collapse modes of the tested tubes is thoroughly analysed. In addition, the effect of the laminate material properties such as the fibre volume content and stacking sequence on the energy absorbing capability of the thin-wall tubes is also examined. Particular attention is paid on the analysis of the mechanics of the tube axial collapse modes from macroscopic and microscopic point of view, emphasizing on the mechanisms related to the crash energy absorption during the compression of the composite tubes. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Three notch configurations representing various damage levels were identified, and the beam specimens were retrofitted using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates and a recently developed Carbon-fiber Hybrid-polymeric Matrix Composite (CHMC) that has been termed CarbonFlex, and that exhibits superior energy dissipation and ductility properties. The peak-load deflections of the CarbonFlex-retrofitted beams were calculated to be between 67.8% and 73.1% higher than their CFRP-retrofitted counterparts. The results are attributed to the substantially higher damage tolerance of CarbonFlex than conventional carbon-fiber reinforced polymer. Finite element models were developed to investigate the damage mechanism and loading carrying capacities of the beams, and the strain/ stress distributions near the notch tips. The numerical results match closely with the experimentally determined load-deflection curves and the strain fields obtained by the digital imaging correlations (DIC) technique. Both experimental and numerical results clearly indicate the effectiveness of CarbonFlex, as a candidate retrofitting material, for damaged steel structures. Lastly, the micro-mechanisms by which CarbonFlex could sufficiently sustain a significant amount of the peak strength at large deformations are discussed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nano-indentation studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Carbon fibres-epoxy cross-ply prepreg layers were interleaved with thin (26 ??m) poly(ethylene-terephthalate) (PET) films. Before the composite preparation, circular holes 1 mm in diameter were drilled in the PET films at several densities (from 0 up to 44 holes/cm2) in order to selectively increase the interlaminar contact area between the epoxy-carbon laminae. In this way, the interlaminar contact area was gradually varied from 0%, corresponding to the case in which non-perforated PET films were used, up to 100% in the case of non-interleaved laminates. The Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the resulting laminates was determined according to the ASTM D-5528-01 standard test method on double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. The critical values of the strain energy release rate determined at the point at which the load versus opening displacement curve becomes non-linear (GIC,NL) resulted to vary from 40 up to 260 J/m2, depending on the interlaminar contact area. All the laminates were then characterized by three point bending tests performed both under quasi-static (5 mm/min) and impact (2 m/s) loading conditions. The elastic modulus of the laminates resulted to be practically independent of the level of interlaminar adhesion, while the bending strength decreased as the interlaminar fracture toughness decreased. The total energy to fracture evaluated under impact conditions showed a non-monotonic correlation with the interlaminar fracture toughness, reaching a maximum level in correspondence of a GIC,NL value of about 60 J/m2. At the same time, the ductility index, i.e. the ratio between the propagation and the initiation energies, evaluated by instrumented Charpy impact tests, markedly increased as the interlaminar fracture toughness decreased. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A numerical analysis strategy based on material property degradation method (MPDM) and cohesive elements (CE) is developed to model progressive failure of scaled double-notched composite laminates, where the material property degradation method is used to model the intralaminar failure and the cohesive elements are employed to account for the delamination at the interfaces. Different failure theories are considered in the material property degradation method-cohesive element approach and a comparative study of these failure theories is presented. The mesh dependency of the material property degradation method-cohesive element approach is investigated with different notch and element types for the double-notched composite laminates. Size scaling effects are also studied by traditional fracture models and the material property degradation method-cohesive element approach, significantly revealing a trend in strength reduction of notched composites with increasing specimen size. The predictions are compared with the experimental results and reasonably good agreement is observed.",

          "abstract": "An oxy-acetylene flame spray torch was used to deposit thin layers of aluminum onto cured glass and basalt fiber-reinforced epoxy tubes. The composite specimens were fabricated by filament winding. Surface coatings embedded in composite laminates were produced. The composite substrates were grit blasted to promote adhesion of the molten aluminum particles. It was found that adhesion increased significantly when the composite substrate was lightly grit blasted, with no adhesion on smooth composite surfaces. The number of passes of the flame spray torch was varied to change the coating thickness and uniformity over the substrate. The electrical resistance of the coatings was measured to assess the suitability of a coating as a conductor. It was found that uniform, electrically conductive coatings were produced with a minimum of two torch passes. Optical images were captured to characterize the coating microstructure and thickness. This investigation did not reveal any visible evidence of damage to the composite substrate. To assess possible degradation effects from the grit blasting and flame spraying processes, the tube specimens were subjected to mechanical testing by applying internal pressurization with hydraulic oil. The tests indicated that the grit blasting and flame spraying processes must be carefully executed to mitigate degradation of the strength of the composite material substrate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

The BAPh/PEN-OH/GF composite laminates exhibit tensile strength (272.4-456.5 MPa) and modulus (4.9-10.0 GPa), flexural strength (507.1-560.9 MPa), and flexural modulus (24.0-30.4 GPa) with high thermal (stable up to 538.3 degrees C) and thermal stabilities (stable up to 475.5 degrees C). The dielectric properties of BAPh/PEN-OH/GF composite laminates have also been investigated, which had little dependence on the frequency. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy results show that the BAPh/PEN-OH/GF composite laminates display excellent interfacial adhesions between the matrix and GFs.

Calculation of the lamina reliability under a multi-axial stress state can be approached by either assuming that the strengths act separately (modal or independent action), or that they interact through a quadratic interaction criterion. The independent action reliability may be calculated in closed form, while interactive criteria require simulations; there is currently insufficient data to make a final determination of preference between them. Using independent action for illustration purposes, the lamina reliability may be plotted in either stress space or in a non-dimensional representation. The sensitivity of the lamina reliability to material properties and stresses is derived. For the typical laminated plate structure, the individual lamina reliabilities may be combined in order to produce formal upper and lower bounds of reliability for the laminate, similar in nature to the bounds on properties produced from variational elastic methods. These bounds are illustrated, and expressions for their sensitivities to variations in the applied load and material strength parameters are given and illustrated. ?? 1991.",

          "abstract": "The dynamic delamination in woven glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP) composite is studied with a 3D finite deformation anisotropic viscoplastic model in conjunction with contact/cohesive laws. The large deformation of the material during impact loading is described through an anisotropic plasticity model in total Lagrangian co-ordinates whose coefficients are determined experimentally. The interaction between lamina is analyzed through a contact/interface model. The tensile and shear tractions in zero thickness interface elements, embedded between lamina, are calculated from interface cohesive law. The interface cohesive law describes the evolution of these tractions in terms of normal and tangential displacement jumps and other interface parameters. The compressive traction at the interface is calculated through the impenetrability conditions employed in the contact module. Once the effective displacement jump exceeds a specified critical value, the interface elements are assumed to have failed, i.e., delamination is said to have taken place. Three interface cohesive laws are proposed to describe the delamination process. It is assumed that loading of interface takes place reversibly up to a specified value of the displacement jump followed by irreversible loading beyond this value. This feature represents a partial damage of the interface in the event of unloading. Dynamic delamination in the woven GRP composite is studied through analyses of plate-on-plate impact experiments. The heterogeneity of composite materials leading to wave dispersion and scattering is modeled by considering a layered composition of the GRP plate. Each lamina is assumed to be made of three layers of materials. The middle layer of half the thickness of lamina is considered as GRP and the two end layers of equal thicknesses are considered to be of matrix material, i.e., polyester resin. The possible delamination of the composite material under compressive shock loading is shown to occur due to local shear effects. This is modeled by considering waviness of the interface between lamina. Interfaces with flat as well as two types of wavy structures are analyzed. Analyses are carried out to establish the effect of critical displacement jump, mixed mode coupling parameter employed in interface laws, interface waviness and the effect of interface laws. The response of GRP composite during impact is characterized in terms of the free surface velocity, delamination event vs. time and interface normal and shear stresses. The interface normal and shear stresses are obtained directly from the interface cohesive laws, as well as, by extrapolating continuum stresses from integration points of the neighboring triangular elements to the interface. It is shown that the finite element model predicts the response of the material in confirmation with available experimental results. The wave dispersion and scattering effects are obtained in the form of attenuation of shock stress and free surface velocity. The model predicts partial delamination during compressive shock loading above a certain threshold due to local shear and mode coupling. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A major concern affecting the efficient use of carbon fibre reinforced composite laminates in the aerospace industry is the low velocity impact damage which may be introduced accidentally during manufacture, operation or maintenance of the composite structures. It is widely reported that the contact behavior of composite laminates under low-velocity impact can be obtained under quasi-static loading conditions. This paper focuses on the study of the correlation of the dent depth to the maximum contact force and damage of composite laminates under quasi-static loading. Analytical and finite element simulation approaches were employed to investigate relations between the contact force and the dent depth. Experimental investigations on the correlation between dent depth, maximum contact force and damage include quasi-static indentation testing, optical and scanning electron microscopic examination of the damage under different loading levels. The effect of damage initiation and growth on the contact behaviour has been discussed. Results show that consistent correlations between the dent depth, maximum contact force and damage exist and can be predicted with the analytical and numerical approaches. Dent depth can be used as an engineering parameter in assessing the severity of damage for composite structures that are subjected to low-velocity impact. This may lead to the development of a cost-effective technique for the inspection and maintenance of composite structures in aerospace applications.",

Impact tests were done at two velocities, viz., 4.49 m/s and 3.78 m/s for both thickness scaled composite specimens with and without nano-composite addition. It was observed that ply-level scaled laminates absorbs more impact energy compared to sub-laminate level scaled specimens. The residual tensile strength was found out by conducting tensile test on the impacted specimens.

Development of matrix cracks in the CFRP laminate under biaxial loadings and permeability of helium gas through the laminate were acquired. In this acquirement, the permeability was measured in relation to crack density and applied biaxial loads. The results of the experiments indicate that stacking sequences of CFRP laminate influence not only matrix crack development but also leakage prevention. Gas permeability through damaged CFRP composite laminates is influenced mainly by crack densities and crack opening displacements, because matrix cracks play a role as leakage path. Permeability through the damaged laminates increases in accordance with damage development, and increasing rate of permeability in connection with the strains is approximately dominated by the external biaxial loads. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The characterisation of the damage state of composite structures is often performed using the acoustic behaviour of the composite system. This behaviour is expected to change significantly as the damage is accumulating in the composite. It is indisputable that different damage mechanisms are activated within the composite laminate during loading scenario. These “damage entities” are acting in different space and time scales within the service life of the structure and may be interdependent. It has been argued that different damage mechanisms attribute distinct acoustic behaviour to the composite system. Loading of cross-ply laminates in particular leads to the accumulation of distinct damage mechanisms, such as matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fibre rupture at the final stage of loading. As highlighted in this work, the acoustic emission activity is directly linked to the structural health state of the laminate. At the same time, significant changes on the wave propagation characteristics are reported and correlated to damage accumulation in the composite laminate. In the case of cross ply laminates, experimental tests and numerical simulations indicate that, typical to the presence of transverse cracking and/or delamination, is the increase of the pulse velocity and the transmission efficiency of a propagated ultrasonic wave, an indication that the intact longitudinal plies act as wave guides, as the transverse ply deteriorates. Further to transverse cracking and delamination, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing the catastrophic failure of the composite and is expected to be directly linked to the acoustic behaviour of the composite, as the stiffness loss results to the velocity decrease of the propagated wave. In view of the above, the scope of the current work is to assess the efficiency of acoustic emission and ultrasonic transmission as a combined methodology for the assessment of the introduced damage and furthermore as a structural health monitoring tool.",

          "abstract": "In recent years the use of carbon fiber-reinforced organic composite materials for highly loaded military and civil aircraft components has continuously increased. Because of these applications it is becoming even more important to be able to predict the material properties of composite laminates with different levels of material anomalies. One of the most common defects found in continuous carbon fiber composite laminate is porosity. The analytical techniques to determine porous laminate stiffness and residual strength are not available. Therefore, a variety of expensive and time-consuming structural tests have to be performed to include different laminate thickness and stacking sequence effects for each composite material. A new analytical approach to determine porous laminate stiffness for various levels of porosity which employs state of the art N.D.T. (nondestructive testing) techniques and photomicrographic examination to determine the porosity/voids distribution through the thickness of the laminate, and a thermomechanical constitutive theory for elastic composites with distributed damage is proposed, originally proposed by Allen et al. (1987a, b) Int. J. Solids Structs 23(9), 1301-1338. The model utilizes second-order tensor valued internal state variables to represent porosity. The equations for engineering constants are developed. ?? 1993.",

The tested sandwich panels were constructed trying four types of polymer foam core (more specifically PMI foam, two grades of linear PVC foam and polyurethane foam) and two types of FRP faceplate laminates made of glass fibre reinforcements impregnated in modified acrylic resin in eight different material combinations. Three modes of collapse were recorded in the compressive tests, one of which being progressive end-crushing of the sandwich panel featured by significant crash energy absorption, feature that was a highly desired since the tested hybrid composites were candidate materials for the manufacture of parts of transportation vehicles. The influence of the most important material properties of the faceplate laminates and foam core and the sandwich construction geometry on the compressive response and the crushing characteristics of the tested sandwich panels such as the peak load, crash energy absorption and collapse modes is extensively examined and analysed. Particular attention is paid on the analysis of the mechanics of progressive deformation and crumpling of the sandwich panels in each of the three collapse modes and especially of the end-crushing mode, emphasizing on the mechanisms related to the crash energy absorption during the edgewise compression of the sandwich panels. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Interface between metal and polymer layer plays a significant role. FMLs have both low density and high relative strength, and other good properties as high damage tolerance: fatigue and impact characteristics, corrosion, and fire resistance. In present work, the microstructure of the aluminum-epoxy/glass and aluminum-epoxy/carbon composites is characterized. The interface between metal and polymer composites with surface treatment and without surface treatment at different pressures was examined. It was observed that pretreatment of the aluminum has a significant effect on the zone between metal and polymer composite. In the interface, there is a direct contact between anodizing layer and resin without fibers, the same for epoxy/glass and epoxy/carbon laminates. The low pressure in autoclave process has a detrimental effect on the structure. It is responsible for the formation of the porosity and delamination in polymer layer and interface between aluminum and polymer composites. Untreated surface of aluminum sheet is characterized by too low adhesion to epoxy composite, especially with carbon reinforcement.",

In this paper, damage in carbon fiber-reinforced concrete (CFRC) under uniaxial compression and three-point-bending conditions was monitored by both electrical resistance measurement and acoustic emission (AE) analysis. The research showed a good correlation existing among curve of load-deflection, changes in electrical resistance and AE hits. For CFRC, the electrical conductivity depends on the percolation network formed by the contacting carbon fiber. The damage occurring inside materials causes breakdown of percolation network and results in an increase in electrical resistance. Therefore, the change in electrical resistance reflects the damage during the entire loading process. On the other hand, AE technique can detect and possibly identify damage mechanisms in fiber-reinforced composites by analyzing AE parameters. These two techniques are complementary for the monitoring damage in CFRC. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In laminated tape composites microcracks in various layers connect and form an easy path for gas leakage. Composites wherein plies of different orientations are dispersed rather than grouped show excellent performance even after cryogenic cycling.

The anisotropy of the homogenized material model results from the homogenization method and from the reformulation of the non-local continuum damage theory to account for the material anisotropy. As a result the damage propagation direction in each ply is predicted with accuracy as compared to the experimental results, while the problems of losing uniqueness and strain localization, which occur in classical finite element simulations when strain softening of materials is involved, can be avoided.To model the delamination process, the hybrid discontinuous Galerkin/extrinsic cohesive law method is introduced at the ply interfaces. This hybrid method avoids the need to propagate topological changes in the mesh with the propagation of the delamination while it preserves the consistency and stability in the un-cracked interfaces.As a demonstration, open-hole coupons with different stacking sequences are studied numerically and experimentally. Both the intra- and inter-laminar failure patterns are shown to be well captured by the computational framework.",

A traction-separation law has been applied to predict theoretically the progressive damage of fiber tow interfaces.

According to the damage contours at different global strain levels, the damage development of fiber tows and interlaminar delamination damage of interface are obtained, explicitly analyzed and correlated with experimental observations. The comparison of model prediction and experimental observations indicate that the model can accurately simulate the damage development of this composite material, i.e. fiber bundle splitting, interaction of free-edge effect and delamination, and final failure of the specimen.

          "abstract": "Fiber metal laminates are the frontline materials for aeronautical and space structures. These composites consists of layers of 2024-T3-aluminum alloy and composite prepreg layers. When the composite layer is a carbon fiber prepreg, the fiber metal laminate, named Carall, offers significant improvements over current available materials for aircraft structures. While weight reduction and improved damage tolerance characteristics were the prime drivers to develop this new family of materials, it turns out that they have additional benefits, which become more and more important for today&#039;s designers, such as cost reduction and improved safety. The degradation of composites is due to environmental effects mainly on the chemical and/or physical properties of the polymer matrix leading to loss of adhesion of fiber/resin interface. Also, the reduction of fiber strength and stiffness are expected due to environmental degradation. Changes in interface/interphase properties leads to more pronounced changes in shear properties than any other mechanical properties. In this work, the influence of moisture in shear properties of carbon fiber/epoxy composites and Carall have been investigated by using interlaminar shear (ILSS) and Iosipescu tests. It was observed that hygrothermal conditioning reduces the Iosipescu shear strength of CF/E and Carall composites due to the moisture absorption in these materials. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Formation of the stitching loop results in a certain disturbance of the uniform placement of the fibres. These deviations in fibre placement produce resin-rich zones that can influence the mechanical behaviour of the composite part. Tensile tests on quadriaxial (45??/90??-45??/0??)s laminates are performed accompanied by acoustic emission (AE) registration and X-ray imaging. Early initiation of damage (matrix cracking) in plies with different fibre orientation has been detected. Damage sites correlate with the resin-rich zones created by the stitching. Finite element (FE) analysis is carried out to develop a model that describes damage of the NCF composites. Numerical multi-level FE homogenization is performed to obtain effective elastic orthotropic properties of NCF composite at micro (unit cell of unidirectional tow) and meso (fabric unit cell) levels. A hierarchical sequence of FE models of different scales is created to analyze in detail the 3D stress state of the NCF composite (meso unit cell). A multi-level submodeling approach is applied during FE analysis. Zones of matrix-dominated damage are predicted. A comparison of non-destructive testing results with computational model is performed. Fracture mechanics parameters of matrix crack are computed and cracks growth stability is studied. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed the MWCNTs shortened by ball milling. The neat and nano-hybrid films were used as interleaves for carbon fiber/bismaleimide (BMI) composite laminates. C-scan results showed that impact damage area decreased for PEK-C film interleaved laminates and further reduced by modification of MWCNTs. The compression after impact (CAI) strength was significantly improved for interleaved composite laminates when compared to baseline composite laminate. Maximum improvement (∼33%) of CAI value was achieved by interlayer of hybrid film with 10wt% MWCNTs. The toughening micromechanism of enhanced resistance to low-energy impact with the incorporation of MWCNTs were investigated based on scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of the fracture surfaces of the tested specimens. It is suggested that thermoplastics, BMI particles and MWCNTs had combined action to reduce interlaminar impact damage and thus to improve CAI strength.",

A homogenized continuum is adopted for the constitutive theory of anisotropic damage and elasticity. Internal variables are introduced to describe the evolution of the damage state under loading and as a subsequence the degradation of the material stiffness. The corresponding rate-equations are subjected to the laws of thermomechanics. Emphasis is placed on a suitable coupling among the equations for the rates of the damage variables with respect to different damage modes.

The developed model is integrated into a progressive approach to predict the transverse stiffness degradation of 30?? unidirectional plies made of AS4/3501-6 carbon/epoxy under both constant and variable amplitude cyclic tensile loading. Also, the stress history in 0?? and 90?? plies and transverse stiffness degradation in 90?? plies of a cross-ply laminate are predicted by using the developed model. The generalized model, in contrast to original one, is capable of simulating stiffness reduction under high stress states where failure occurs in transverse plies of a cross-ply laminate during the first cycles of the fatigue loading.

A thin glass fiber veil impregnated with ammonium polyphosphate was bonded onto the composite surface intended for heat exposure. There was no significant change in the time-to-ignition with the introduction of the fire retardant glass fiber veil. While similar PHRR values were measured in both flax/epoxy laminates and balsa-core sandwich composites, the total heat release was significantly higher in the later. It is noteworthy, the heat release rates (including the peak values) measured for fire-protected composites were significantly lower than those measured for their unprotected counterparts. Through-thickness temperature profiles across the sandwich composite revealed the effectiveness of the fire retardant veil in minimizing thermal damage of underlying substrate composites. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

The model is then used to analyze the splitting mode (mode II) fracture in dynamic loading of a 0° lamina. Appropriate scaling factors are used in the model in order to have the elastic strain energy, for a fixed nonlocal interaction distance (the peridynamic horizon), match the classical one. No special criteria for splitting failure are required to capture this fracture mode in the lamina. Convergence studies under uniform grid refinement for a fixed horizon size (m-convergence) and under decreasing the peridynamic horizon (δ-convergence) are performed. The computational results show that the splitting fracture mode obtained with peridynamics compares well with experimental observations. Moreover, in the limit of the horizon going to zero, the maximum crack propagation speed computed with peridynamics approaches the value obtained from an analytical classical formulation for the steady-state dynamic interface debonding found in the literature. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.",

Initial tests were conducted on simple FML sandwich structures based on 2024-O and 2024-T3 aluminium alloy skins and a polypropylene fibre reinforced polypropylene (PP/PP) composite core. Here, it was shown that laminates based on the stronger 2024-T3 alloy offered a superior perforation resistance to those based on the 2024-O system. Tests were also conducted on multi-layered materials in which the composite plies were dispersed between more than two aluminium sheets. For a given target thickness, the multi-layered laminates offered a superior perforation resistance to the sandwich laminates. The perforation resistances of the various laminates investigated here were compared by determining the specific perforation energy (s.p.e.) of each system. Here, the sandwich FMLs based on the low density PP/PP core out-performed the multi-layer systems, offering s.p.e.&#039;s roughly double that exhibited by a similar Kevlar-based laminate. A closer examination of the panels highlighted a number of failure mechanisms such as ductile tearing, delamination and fibre failure in the composite plies as well as permanent plastic deformation, thinning and shear fracture in the metal layers. Finally, the perforation threshold of all of the FML structures was predicted using the Reid-Wen perforation model. Here, it was found that the predictions offered by this simple model were in good agreement with the experimental data. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The great diversity of the damage mechanisms and their patterns of evolution makes it extremely difficult to estimate the strength margins. It is still impossible, for instance, to perform simulations on industrial structures made of unidirectional ply laminates up to rupture. The strategy adopted in this study on designing laminated composite structures is based on the choice of materials (woven or unidirectional plies) and the use of simple models (focusing on the rupture of the first ply) with which industrial structure analyses can be carried out. The choice of materials (woven or unidirectional plies) does not depend only on mechanical criteria but also on the simplicity of the corresponding modelling procedures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
