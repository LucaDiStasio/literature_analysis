          "abstract": "Fatigue delamination growth of multidirectional laminates with 45??/-45?? fracture interface was experimentally studied. Delamination tests under three mixed I/II mode ratios were carried out via mixed mode bending test apparatus. Significant R-curve effects on the fatigue crack growth rates and thresholds due to fiber bridging and crack branching were observed, which make the traditional Paris Law unsuitable. In this paper, a formerly developed modified Paris Law with the normalized strain energy release rate as the fracture governing parameter is investigated again. The results from the multidirectional delamination tests fit the modified Paris Law very well, and hence have validated it by experiments. Moreover, the thresholds normalized to delamination resistance were utilized to evaluate the critical fatigue crack growth conditions. By the combination of test data for both 0??/5?? and 90??/90?? laminates, an interface-independent normalized threshold was proposed, which was found linearly decreasing with mode mixture ratios. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The numerical model includes lamina and interface elements. The description of the delamination crack growth rate is based on the cyclic degradation of bilinear interface elements linking the evolution of the damage variable with the delamination crack growth rate. The constitutive cyclic damage model is calibrated by means of mixed mode fatigue experiments and reproduces the experimental results successfully and with minor error. It is concluded that only with implementing a cyclic damage variable in the cohesive interface element the experimentally observed crack growth and stiffness degradation can be captured properly. Scanning electron microscopy of fracture surfaces after cyclic loading revealed that abrasion of crack bridging surface roughness is the main microscopical cause of weakening and degradation of the interface. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiments were performed to investigate the variations of cutting forces with or without onset of delamination during the drilling operations. The effects of tool geometry and drilling parameters on cutting force variations in CFRP composite materials drilling were also experimentally examined. The experimental results show that the delamination-free drilling processes may be obtained by the proper selections of tool geometry and drilling parameters. The effects of drilling parameters and tool wear on delamination factor are also presented and discussed. Cutting temperature has long been recognized as an important factor influencing the tool wear rate and tool life. An experimental investigation of flank surface temperatures is also presented in this paper. Experimental results indicated that the flank surface temperatures increase with increasing cutting speed but decreasing feed rate. Optimal cutting conditions are proposed to avoid damage from burning during the drilling processes.",

For this purpose, digital image correlation has been used as strain measurement technique to record the delamination shapes in situ testing. An explanation is put-forward in order to understand the effects of variable amplitude loading on the formation of delamination shapes.

          "abstract": "Composite laminates (CFRP, GFRP, and fiber metal composite laminates) are attractive for many applications (such as aerospace and aircraft structural components) due to their superior properties. Usually, mechanical drilling operation is an important final machining process for components made of composite laminates. However, composite laminates are regarded as hard-to-machine materials, which results in low drilling efficiency and undesirable drilling-induced delamination. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the cost-effectiveness of currently-available drilling processes and to develop more advanced drilling processes for composite laminates. Such improvement and development will benefit from a comprehensive literature review on drilling of composite laminates. This review paper summarizes an up-to-date progress in mechanical drilling of composite laminates reported in the literature. It covers drilling operations (including conventional drilling, grinding drilling, vibration-assisted twist drilling, and high speed drilling), drill bit geometry and materials, drilling-induced delamination and its suppressing approaches, thrust force, and tool wear. It is intended to help readers to obtain a comprehensive view on mechanical drilling of composite laminates. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

At elevated temperature, the threshold values in the fatigue loading were only about 10% of the critical values in the static tests. A fractographic analysis of the delamination growth revealed that the fracture surfaces generated at elevated temperature generally were similar to the fracture surfaces generated at room temperature.

With the presence of high crack-tip local stresses, the effect of inherently nonlinear composite material constitutive properties on the delamination becomes an interest and important issue. In this paper, a nonlinear anisotropic laminate elasticity formulation is introduced to establish governing field equations for a delamination between dissimilar fiber-composite plies. In the context of nonlinear fracture mechanics, the dominant stress singularity and asymptotic solution structure are determined for a delamination in a composite laminate with nonlinear ply constitutive properties. A computational method is used to analyze the delamination field in a composite with complex lamination variables. Delamination energy release rates associated with individual modes are obtained for symmetric angle-ply composite laminates for illustration. Several case studies are conducted to compare the solutions for nonlinear delamination problems with those of corresponding linear interface-crack problems. Unique features of nonlinear composite delamination mechanics are presented, including the order of stress singularity, coupled tearing-mode contributions, and large delamination closure due to strong ply material anisotropy, discontinuity and Poisson&#039;s effect. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The damage characteristics of a composite material subjected to subperforation impact can be classified as indentation, fiber breakage, matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding and delamination. Among these damage modes, delamination has been found to be important for all cases of loading. In this study, the damage characteristics of many composite plates made of glass/epoxy, Kevlar/epoxy, and graphite/epoxy were investigated. Delaminations in the impacted composite plates were inspected by high-intensity light, X-ray radiog- raphy, ultrasonic imaging system and edge replication. It was found that delamination in every interface of impacted composite plates had a peanut-like shape. Since membrane ef- fect could be ignored in this study, stresses caused by bending were the major stresses which should be responsible for the delamination. Although the interlaminar stresses had been analyzed by many investigators for the determination of delamination, in this study, however, the mismatching of bending stiffness between two adjacent laminae was pro- posed as an indicator of delamination in the composite laminates subjected to subperfora- tion impact. The effects of material properties, stacking sequence and thickness on the delamination were discussed. The justification of the hypothesis of bending stiffness mis- matching was also presented.",

In-plane compression tests at strain rates around 400/s quasi-isotropic laminates were performed using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). The material system used was Texipreg® HS160 REM, comprising high strength unidirectional carbon fiber and epoxy resin. The dynamic strength of quasi-isotropic laminates exhibits a considerable increase when compared to the static values. The finite-element model used ABAQUS™ three-dimensional solid elements C3D8I with 8 nodes and user-defined interface finite elements with 8 nodes [Gonçalves JPM, de Moura MFSF, de Castro PMST, Marques AT. Interface element including point-to-surface constraints for three-dimensional problems with damage propagation.

Influence of intralaminar cracking on the apparent interlaminar mode I fracture toughness of cross-ply laminates. Fatigue Fract Eng Mater Struct 2004;27(9):759-66.]. These interface elements which connect the three-dimensional solid elements modeling the composite layers, include a cohesive damage model allowing the simulation of delamination initiation and propagation. Hence the present model assumes that the phenomenon of failure under these conditions is mainly dictated by interface delamination. This is supported by experimental tests which showed that all quasi-isotropic laminates split into several almost intact sublaminates. The model compares very well with experimental results, confirming the formulated hypothesis that the internal layer damage does not markedly contribute to the quasi-isotropic laminate failure. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The outside diameters of the cladding and polyimide coating are 40 and 52 ??m, respectively. First, a brief summary is presented for applications of small-diameter FBG sensors to damage monitoring in composite structures. Then, we propose a new damage detection system for quantitative evaluation of delamination length in CFRP laminates using Lamb wave sensing. In this system, a piezo-ceramic actuator generates Lamb waves in a CFRP laminate. After the waves propagate in the laminate, transmitted waves are received by an FBG sensor attached on or embedded in the laminate using a newly developed high-speed optical wavelength interrogation system. This system was applied to detect interlaminar delamination in CFRP cross-ply laminates. When the Lamb waves passed through the delamination, the amplitude decreased and a new wave mode appeared. These phenomena could be well simulated using a finite element analysis. From the changes in the amplitude ratio and the arrival time of the new mode depending on the delamination length, it was found that this system could evaluate the delamination length quantitatively. Furthermore, small-diameter FBG sensors were embedded in a double-lap type coupon specimen, and the debonding progress could be evaluated using the wavelet transform. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The mixed mode delamination behavior of through-thickness reinforced carbon-epoxy laminates was investigated using two different test specimens, a T-stiffener and a mixed-mode bending (MMB) specimen. Small quantities of titanium or carbon z-fibers (short rods) substantially improve delamination resistance in both types of specimen. Reinforcement raises the ultimate strength of the MMB specimen by a factor of three. However, the failure sequence and therefore the ultimate load in the T-stiffeners depend strongly on the test configuration. No change in ultimate load is seen in some cases but up to 40% improvement is observed in others. Improved delamination resistance results from crack bridging by the z-fibers, which reduces the driving force for crack growth. Mode I crack displacement is suppressed more effectively than mode II displacement, resulting in purely mode II cracking in what without z-fibers would be a mixed mode or primarily mode I loading situation. This important consequence of so-called large scale bridging effects confirms recent theoretical results for delamination specimens. The mechanisms of bridging and crack propagation are described here in detail. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In order to make use of a simple loading device, a mode-II case is used as the basis of the experimental study. The position of the crack is recorded quantitatively by means of a high-speed camera and dedicated image processing techniques. The delamination process is modeled by means of an interfacial Continuum Damage Model (CDM), similar to Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) approaches. In order to make suitable comparison between test and explicit finite element simulation of the test, criterai of proper temporal and spatial discretization have been derived. They ensure a fine description of the process zone and a proper description of the degradation evolution of the interface. Using such simulations and direct comparisons with the tests results, it is shown that the experimental results cannot be reproduced numerically without introducing rate effects. Then, it is proposed and identified by means of comparison between experiments and numerical simulation a bounded-damage-rate interfacial model. The main consequence of the proposed rate-dependent model is that it introduces a maximum crack velocity which is a function of the maximum damage rate. The dependence of the critical energy release rate on the crack’s velocity is analyzed, which leads to the identification of an equivalent rate-dependent fracture mechanics criterion.",

The aim of the investigation described in this article was to develop a model capable of predicting the fatigue delamination growth in a general case, under varying mode mix conditions. The crack growth development in essentially unidirectional laminates of carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy was analysed in terms of the Paris law for different constant propagation modes: mode I (double-cantilever beam test), mode II (end-notched flexure test) and different mixed-modes I/II (mixed-mode bending test). The dependence of the Paris law parameters on mode mix is compared with the existing models in the literature. It is shown that these models do not reproduce the non-monotonic dependence on mode mix which has been observed in experimental data. Therefore, an improved phenomenological model is introduced and compared with the experimental data obtained by other researchers. To check the ability of the model to predict variable mixed-mode fatigue delamination, the mixed-mode end-loaded split test was employed and the experimental results were compared to the predictions of the model. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the dependency of the crack propagation rates on the degree of mode mix are also discussed on the basis of fractographic analysis. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The most serious is the delamination that may occur during drilling, and which severely compromises the mechanical characteristics of the material around the hole. The main cause of delamination is generally held to be the thrust force exerted by the drill point; the most commonly used method for reducing delamination is to place a support under the workpiece. Paradoxically, while this practice does limit delamination, the force exerted by the drill point is actually greater than in unsupported drilling. The presence of the support does influence the delamination mechanism, but exactly how that mechanism works does not seem to be fully understood yet. This study analyzes the differences in delamination mechanisms when drilling with and without a support placed under the workpiece. This investigation has led to hypothesize two main differences in the mechanism. On the basis of this analysis, a new device was designed that counters the hypothesized delamination mechanism. A simple prototype of this device was built, and its effectiveness verified. The results show that the proposed device can drastically reduce delamination. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "Despite the recent success of modeling progressive damage of open-hole fiber reinforced composites subjected to tension (OHT), it is still a challenging task to predict the strengths and the damage progression of open-hole composite laminates under compressive loading (OHC). Herein, we propose a progressive damage model for OHC based on our early model for OHT and apply it to study the size effects of OHC. In the proposed model, continuum shell elements are used to account for both in-plane and out-of-plane deformation and delamination is modeled using cohesive elements. A smeared crack model is used to model the progressive failure of composite plies. It is found that the proposed model can predict accurately the experimental strengths and damage patterns with the assumption that the translaminar fracture toughness for blocked plies increases. The different failure mechanisms of the sublaminate scaled laminates of the stacking sequence 45/90/-45/0ms and the ply-level scaled laminates of stacking sequence 45n/90n/-45n/0ns are found to be closely related to the in-plane shear stress of the central 0° ply block and the initiation of interface delamination.",

This test system, based on the DCB test specimen, is a mass-spring-specimen dynamic system designed to resonate. The defined operating conditions allow performing delamination propagation tests under imposed load and stopping the test under reproducible conditions, identical to the ones recommended in the ASTM-D6115 standard. This system allows fatigue tests to be driven up to 100. Hz, reducing the time taken by a factor of ten without detrimental heat being generated in the material. The effect of frequency on the fatigue delamination growth on mode I has been investigated through a comparison with standard tests performed at 10. Hz. A decrease in resistance to the propagation of delamination is observed with the increase in frequency for the composite studied. This frequency effect seems to be a strain rate effect and was taken in consideration by using dynamical critical energy restitution rate for the G- N curve plotting. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

A damaged exponential traction-displacement jump relationship is proposed for the cohesive model and an exponential damage evolution law on the evolvement of displacement jump is proposed to describe the irreversible delamination crack propagation. The implementation of cohesive model uses zero-thickness cohesive element and middle-plane isoparametric interpolation technique. The mesh size effect is solved by regulating the delamination fracture toughness by the cohesive length, and the numerical convergence problem for the snap instability is addressed by viscous regularization. Four representative delamination cases of composite laminates are used to validate the proposed cohesive model: (a) double cantilever beam (mode-I), (b) end notch flexure (mode-II), (c) mixed-mode bending fracture, and (d) fixed ratio mixed mode. The effects of the cohesive strengths and mesh sizes on the global load-displacement response for four cases are studied. In addition, the numerical results using proposed cohesive model are also compared with the results obtained by the virtual crack closure technique and other existing cohesive models. The proposed cohesive model is demonstrated to predict the mixed-mode delamination response of composite laminates accurately and effectively. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The influence of Kevlar stitchings on edge delaminations, ultimate tensile strength and tension-tension fatigue life were examined on laminates of two stacking sequences ([??45/0/90]s and [??30/90]s), as representative of two classes of fiber-dominated and matrix-dominated laminates. Through-thickness stitching offered a significant improvement in the static delamination resistance of laminated composites, but had varying effects on the ultimate tensile stress of the laminates under study, with an increase in strength of [??30/90]s laminates and a decrease in strength of [??45/0/90]s laminates. Similarly the fatigue life of matrix dominated [??30/90]s specimens was considerably extended by stitching, while the fatigue resistance of fiber-dominated [??45/0/90]s specimens was reduced, particularly at high fatigue stresses. Stitching appeared very efficient in arresting delamination in [??30/90]s specimens for both static and fatigue loads, but did not prove to be as efficient in stopping fatigue delaminations in [??45/0/90]s specimens, since Kevlar threads were found to be prone to breakage under cyclic loading. As a conclusion, while the static delamination resistance of laminated composites is improved by stitching, this does not automatically result in better fatigue performance for all lamination sequences. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Machining processes are generally used to cut; drill, or contour composite laminates for building products. In fact, drilling is one of the most commonly used manufacturing processes to install fasteners for assembly of laminate composites. The material anisotropy resulting from fiber reinforcement heavily influences the machinability during machining. Machining of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) components is often needed in spite of the fact that most FRP structures can be made to near-net shape and drilling is the most frequently employed secondary machining process for fiber reinforced materials. Therefore, the precise machining needs to perform to ensure dimensional stability and to obtain a better productivity of the component. The drilling parameters and specimen parameters evaluated were speed, feed rate, drill size and specimen thickness. A series of experiments were conducted using TRIAC VMC CNC machining center to machine the composite laminate specimens at various cutting parameters and material parameters. The measured results of delamination at the entry and exit side of the specimen were measured and analyzed using commercial statistical software MINITAB14. The experimental results indicated that the specimen thickness, feed rate and cutting speed are reckoned to be the most significant factors contributing to the delamination. A signal-to-noise ratio is employed to analyze the influence of various parameters on peel up and push down delamination factor in drilling of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composite laminates. The main objective of this study is to determine factors and combination of factors that influence the delamination using Taguchi and response surface methodology and to achieve the optimization machining conditions that would result in minimum delamination. From the analysis it is evident that among the all significant parameters, specimen thickness and cutting speed have significant influence on peel up delamination and the specimen thickness and feed have more significant influence on push down delamination. Confirmation experiments were conducted to verify the predicted optimal parameters with the experimental results, good agreement between the predicted and experimental results obtained to be of the order of 99%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The matrix epoxy with a thickness of 50 ??m was chosen as the interleaf material in order to clarify the effect of resin-rich layer thickness on the delamination fatigue crack growth behavior. Tests under mode I loading were carried out using double cantilever beam specimens. For tests under mode II loading, three-point end notched flexure specimens were used for interlaminar fracture toughness tests, while four-point end notched flexure specimens were used for delamination fatigue tests. The mode I properties (interlaminar fracture toughness and delamination fatigue threshold) of these epoxy-interleaved CFRP laminates were almost identical to those of the laminates without interleaf (base CFRP laminates). The effect of epoxy interleaf was completely different under mode II loading. The mode II interlaminar fracture toughness for the epoxy-interleaved laminates was 1.6 (initial value) and 3.4 (propagation value) times higher than that for the base CFRP laminates. The mode II delamination fatigue threshold of the epoxy-interleaved laminates was 2-2.3 times higher than those of the base CFRP laminates. While the toughness of the interleaf is the key factor under mode I, the thickness of interlayer is the key factor under mode II. The difference in the effect of the self-same epoxy interlayer on the interlaminar fracture properties under modes I and II loadings was discussed on the bases of the fractographic observations and mechanism considerations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

On the edge of laminates, out-of-plane stresses arise, even up to material&#039;s failure. Layer thickness is also known as well to influence delamination onset stress. Making use of a conventional model (that is to say assuming plies homogeneity, elastic linear behaviour, plane interlaminar surface and interface&#039;s infinite stiffness) and of a local stress tensor correction near the edge, allows, thanks to an asymptotic method, an efficient calculation of the full stress tensor. A stress criterion has then been studied. Criterion parameters assessment, from test results, has been focused on, based on conjugate gradient method and experimental thickness effect. Edge Delamination Tests have been performed on several specimens of various layups. Interlaminar shear, tension, as well as shear and tension combination have been investigated. Acoustic emission was used to detect delamination onset. As expected, these tests have exhibited layer thickness influence on onset stress. Shear parameter assessment shows good agreement between theory and experimental results. A single set of parameters is necessary to predict delamination for different layups. But experimental testing for both tensile and mixed mode has shown that failure may not be interlaminar, as expected, but intralaminar. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In an effort to further understand the impact response of composite laminates, various degrees of impact ranging from subperforation to perforation were introduced to glass/epoxy laminates through an instrumented drop-weight impactor. In addition, composite laminates of various in-plane dimensions and thicknesses were examined for in-plane dimensional and thickness effects, respectively. Experimental results showed that in-plane dimensional effect was not as significant as thickness effect. The impacted composite laminates were then subjected to compression after impact (CAI) tests for characterizations of residual mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that perforation was the most important damage stage in composite laminates subjected to impact loading since impact characteristics (peak force, contact duration and absorbed energy) and mechanical properties degradation (residual compressive maximum force and residual compressive absorbed energy) of composite laminates became stable once perforation took place. However. it was also found that delamination played a very important role in the characterizations of mechanical properties degradation. Since the impact response of composite laminates is due to plate bending to some extent, bending analysis was used to explain the greater influence of thickness effect to in-plane dimensional effect. It was also found that bending analysis was feasible for interpretation of delamination in mechanical properties degradation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Delamination was known to be one of the most important damage modes in composite laminates subjected to impact loading. In an effort to further understand the impact response of composite laminates, various degrees of impact ranging from subperforation to perforation were introduced to glass/epoxy laminates through an instrumented drop-weight impactor. In addition, composite laminates of various in-plane dimensions and thicknesses were examined for in-plane dimensional and thickness effects, respectively. Experimental results showed that in-plane dimensional effect was not as significant as thickness effect. The impacted composite laminates were then subjected to compression after impact (CAI) tests for characterizations of residual mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that perforation was the most important damage stage in composite laminates subjected to impact loading since impact characteristics (peak force, contact duration and absorbed energy) and mechanical properties degradation (residual compressive maximum force and residual compressive absorbed energy) of composite laminates became stable once perforation took place. However, it was also found that delamination played a very important role in the characterizations of mechanical properties degradation. Since the impact response of composite laminates is due to plate bending to some extent, bending analysis was used to explain the greater influence of thickness effect to in-plane dimensional effect. It was also found that bending analysis was feasible for interpretation of delamination in mechanical properties degradation.",

          "abstract": "The experimental characterization of the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of multidirectional composite laminates is complicated because the crack tends to migrate from the propagation plane (crack jumping) invalidating the tests. However, the selection of the appropriate bending stiffness of the beam arms can avoid this tendency allowing this characterization. In the present work, six stacking sequences numerically analyzed have been experimentally tested to validate the methodology. The obtained results show that crack jumping can be effectively avoided by increasing the stiffness of the crack arms. Micrographies of the tested specimens show that the delamination is not a perfect interlaminar fracture as fiber tearing is also involved. The obtained toughness values show a dependency upon both the amount of fiber bridging and the interface angles.",

          "abstract": "Impact tests were carried out on composite laminates and composite scarf repairs, while both were subjected to in-plane loading with tensile pre-strain levels up to 5000microstrain. The results show that pre-straining of the composite laminates has no noticeable influence on the size of the delamination area for the given impact energy of 8J, which represents a typical barely-visible impact on thin-skin composite structures. For composite scarf joints, however, resulting damage has been found to be a combination of adhesive disbonding and matrix cracking (delamination and intraply cracking) in the composite laminate. The size of this mixed type of damage increases significantly with increasing pre-strain levels. A finite element model was developed to investigate the interaction between adhesive disbonding and composite delamination. The computational results reveal that both delamination and adhesive disbonding are dominated by the mode II fracture. Since the critical mode II fracture energy release rate for composite laminates (G IIC=1.08kJ/m 2) is much less than that pertinent to the adhesive (G IIC=3.73kJ/m 2), delamination tends to occur first in the composite laminates, which then shield the growth of disbonding in the adhesive. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the results of a series of blast tests on a carbon fiber-reinforced poly-ether-imide (PEI) and a glass fiber-reinforced PEI composite. Initially, the fracture properties of the two composite systems were characterized through a series of flexural and interlaminar fracture tests. Blast testing was then undertaken on a ballistic pendulum facility, capable of measuring the impulse imparted by the plastic explosive. Delamination, localized fiber buckling, fiber fracture, and shear failure at the boundary of the clamped plates were identified as the primary failure mechanisms in the laminates, with their severity depending on the panel thickness and the applied impulse. Delamination was very localized along the center plane of the laminate, a reflection of the very high interlaminar fracture toughness of these composites. The critical impulse for rear surface fiber fracture has been found to increase rapidly with laminate thickness for the range of panels considered here. The impulses associated with the onset of rear-surface fiber fracture and complete failure of the target were similar, suggesting that rear surface fiber fracture is a pre-cursor to complete failure in these laminates. Limited tests on the glass fiber-reinforced PEI system showed that it offers a superior blast resistance to its carbon fiber counterpart. © SAGE Publications 2008.",

The first severe failure induced by the low-velocity drop-weight impact occurred as delamination between the aluminum and fiber-epoxy layers at the non-impact side. It was followed by a visible shear crack in the outer aluminum layer on the non-impact face. Through-thickness shear cracks in the aluminum sheets and severe damage in the fiber laminated layers (including delamination between adjacent fiber-epoxy laminae with different fiber orientations) developed under higher energy impacts. The impact properties of fiber-metal laminates varied with different constituent materials and fiber orientations. Since it was punched through easily, the aramid-fiber reinforced fiber-metal laminates (ARALL) offered poorer impact resistance than the glass-fiber reinforced fiber-metal laminates (GLARE). Tougher and more ductile aluminum alloys improved the impact resistance. GLARE made of cross-ply prepregs provided better impact resistance than GLARE with unidirectional plies.",

This was followed by a series of perforation tests on multilayer configurations.It has been shown that both the composite and the aluminum substrates exhibit a low degree of rate-sensitivity, with both the tensile strength and the perforation energy increasing slightly in passing from quasi-static to dynamic rates of loading. Similarly, FMLs based on combinations of the composite and metal constituents exhibit a low degree of rate-sensitivity, with the impact perforation energy and the maximum impact force being only ten to fifteen percent higher than their quasi-static values. An examination of the cross-sections of the failed laminates indicated that the failure processes were similar at both quasi-static and dynamic rates of strain. Also, similar levels of plastic deformation, fiber fracture and delamination were observed at both rates. Finally, it has been shown that the energy to perforate the various FMLs is directly related to the aggregated perforation energies of their constituent parts.",

The present study considers the variation of the interlaminar failure energy, G C, with the extent of crack jumping, and ensuing fiber bridging, which arises during the growth of the delamination in the multidirectional-laminates under the various modes of loading. The main type of laminate which was studied was a multidirectional fiber composite prepared from 24 ply lay-ups of (-45°/0°/+45°) 2S(+45°/0°/-45°) 2S. The initial delamination was located at the +45°/-45° mid-plane of the specimen. It has been found that when the values of the interlaminar fracture energy, G C, are ascertained as a function of the length of the propagating crack, a, then very complex relationships are observed. This was the case for all the different modes of loading, and these observations reflected the complex failure paths which occurred as the delamination propagated through the multidirectional fiber composites. It was, however, possible to define clearly the onset of crack initiation. These results also revealed that the values for the interlaminar fracture energy, G C (initiation), at crack initiation for the (-45°/0°/+45°) 2S(+45°/0°/-45°) 2S multidirectional laminates were always significantly greater than that for the corresponding unidirectional (i.e., 0°/0°) laminates. © 1999 Technomic Publishing Co., Inc.",

Tension-tension fatigue tests on notched unidirectional FMLs have shown that these laminates offer fatigue lives up to fifty times greater than those offered by a notched monolithic titanium alloy. An examination of the failed FMLs highlighted the presence of delamination between the titanium alloy and the fiber-reinforced composite.

Drilling-induced delamination occurs both at the entrance and at the exit planes. This paper presents an analysis of delamination during drilling. The analysis uses a fracture mechanics approach in which the opening-mode delamination fracture toughness, a material parameter, is used with a plate model of the laminate. The analysis predicts an optimal thrust force (defined as the minimum force above which delamination is initiated) as a function of drilled hole depth. Good agreement is achieved with data obtained from drilling carbon fiber-epoxy laminates. An advantage of the model is that it can predict varying degrees of delamination for other materials, such as glass fiber-epoxy, and for hybrid composites. In addition, the optimal thrust force for no delamination can be used to control a drilling machine with thrust force feedback for maximizing productivity.",

Progressive damage parameters, such as the transverse crack density and the delamination ratio, were measured. A simple modified shear-lag analysis including the thermal residual strains was conducted to predict the transverse crack density and the delamination length. The analysis did not consider the interaction between the transverse cracks and the delamination. In the present paper, a prediction is presented for the transverse crack density including the effect of delamination growth. The prediction shows better agreement with the experimental results, especially for laminates with thicker 90 ?? plies in which extensive delamination occurs. Loading/unloading tests have also been performed to obtain the Young&#039;s modulus reduction and the permanent strain as functions of the damage state. The shear-lag predictions of the Young&#039;s modulus reduction and the permanent strain are compared with the experimental data. Better agreement is obtained when the interaction between transverse cracks and delamination is considered. ?? 1995.",

Simulation of drilling process is an effective method in optimizing the drill geometry and process parameters in order to improve hole quality and to reduce the drill wear. In this research we have developed three-dimensional (3D) FE model for drilling CFRP. A 3D progressive intra-laminar failure model based on the Hashin&#039;s theory is considered. Also an inter-laminar delamination model which includes the onset and growth of delamination by using cohesive contact zone is developed. The developed model with inclusion of the improved delamination model and real drill geometry is used to make comparison between the step drill of different stage ratio and twist drill. Thrust force, torque and work piece stress distributions are estimated to decrease by the use of step drill with high stage ratio. The model indicates that delamination and other workpiece defects could be controlled by selection of suitable step drill geometry. Hence the 3D model could be used as a design tool for drill geometry for minimization of delamination in CFRP drilling. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

This study explored the resistance to delamination under fatigue loading of carbon and glass fiber prepreg laminates with the same resin system, containing various ply drop geometries, and using thicker plies typical of wind turbine blades. Applied stress and strain levels to produce significant delamination at ply drops have been determined, and the experimental results correlated through finite element and analytical models. Carbon fiber laminates with ply drops, while performing adequately under static loads, delaminated in fatigue at low maximum strain levels except for the thinnest ply drops. The lower elastic modulus of the glass fiber laminates resulted in much higher strains to produce delamination for equivalent ply drop geometries. The results indicate that ply drops for carbon fibers should be much thinner than those commonly used for glass fibers in wind turbine blades.",

It is shown how these models associated with the statistical description of strength or energy released in the 90° plies make it possible to describe the development of transverse cracking in monotonic or fatigue loading. According to the nature of cross-ply laminates, transverse cracking is not, however, sufficient for describing the development of transverse cracks in 90° plies in the case of monotonic loading.

The tensile properties of the plain aluminum, the composite materials and the thermoplastic fiber-metal laminates were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. The fatigue tests were also conducted under load control in accordance with the ASTM E466 standard procedure. Various loading cycles were employed for the fatigue tests in order to minimize the possibility of heat generation on the composite materials. Load levels of 40, 60 and 80% of yield strength of each thermoplastic fiber-metal laminate panel were applied with zero to max loading. The glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene hybrid systems exhibited higher fatigue strength than the self-reinforced polypropylene-based fiber-metal laminates. Then, punch-stretch forming tests were performed in order to evaluate the formability of the hybrid systems.

First, a brief summary is presented for applications of small-diameter FBG sensors to damage monitoring in composite structures. Then, we propose a new damage detection system for quantitative evaluation of delamination length in CFRP laminates using Lamb wave sensing. In this system, a piezo-ceramic actuator generates Lamb waves in a CFRP laminate. After the waves propagate in the laminate, transmitted waves are received by an FBG sensor attached on or embedded in the laminate using a newly developed high-speed optical wavelength interrogation system. This system was applied to detect interlaminar delamination in CFRP cross-ply laminates. When the Lamb waves passed through the delamination, the amplitude decreased and a new wave mode appeared. These phenomena could be well simulated using a finite element analysis. From the changes in the amplitude ratio and the arrival time of the new mode depending on the delamination length, it was found that this system could evaluate the delamination length quantitatively. Furthermore, small-diameter FBG sensors were embedded in a double-lap type coupon specimen, and the debonding progress could be evaluated using the wavelet transform.",

In this model, a pre-softening zone ahead of the existing traditional softening zone is proposed. In this pre-softening zone, the initial stiffnesses and the interface strengths at the integration points of cohesive elements are gradually reduced as the corresponding effective relative displacements at these points increase. However, the onset displacement corresponding to the onset damage is not changed in this model. Moreover, the fracture toughness of materials for determining the final displacement of complete decohesion is kept constant. This cohesive model is implemented in the explicit time integration scheme combined with a powerful three-dimensional (3D) hybrid finite element for evaluating the delamination propagations on interfaces in composite laminates. A DCB problem is employed to analyze the characteristics of the present cohesive model. In order to reduce the computational cost for dealing with more complex problems, a stress-based criterion is also adopted in our numerical model for evaluating various in-plane damages, such as matrix cracks, fiber breakage, etc. Finally, two experimental examples are employed to illustrate the validity of the present approach. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper bulletproof laminates were obtained using 30 plies of glass-fiber reinforced-epoxy matrix composites. The ballistic performance of these laminates was varied by modifying the properties of the constituent laminate or by changing the laminate assemblage. An automated digital analysis procedure was developed in order to determine size and shape parameters that characterize the damaged areas. The procedure developed proved to be robust and sensible enough to cope with subtle variations on the damaged areas, which are due to the differences on the mechanical response of the composites caused by modifications on their microstructure. The results obtained show that not only the area of delamination is important to quantify the ballistic performance. The isotropy of the ballistic response, determined measuring the Feret Ratio or the Circular Shape Factor, is also important. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

For another two lay-ups with fibre bridging effect, the R-curve is included using tri-linear and exponential traction-separation laws. Results show that with proper selection of cohesive parameters and inclusion of R-curve effect, the delamination behaviour can be characterised well through numerical simulations.",

In this paper a new micromechanical approach is developed to overcome such shortcomings. For this purpose, a unit cell in the ply level of composite laminate including transverse cracking and delamination is considered. Then, the governing equations for the stress and displacement fields of the unit cell are derived. The obtained approximate stress field is used to calculate the energy release rate for the propagation of transverse cracking and induced delamination. To show the capability of the new method, it is employed for the analyses of general laminates with [0/90]. s, [45/-45]. s, [30/-30]. s and [90/45/0/-45]. s lay-ups under combined loadings to calculate the energy release rate due to the transverse cracking and induced delamination. It is shown that the obtained energy release rates for transverse cracking and delamination initiation are in good agreement with the available results in the literature and finite element method. Furthermore, the occurrence priority of further transverse cracks and/or delamination at each damage state of the laminates will be discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Load-unload tests are performed to identify the sequence and extent of damage and the corresponding displacements at which they occur for a wide range of laminate thicknesses. Energies absorbed at different levels of damage are obtained from the load-unload curves. Two different support spans of 25.4 mm (1 in.) and 101.6 mm (4 in.) diameter with different layers (1, 2, 4, 6, 11, and 22 with 0.6 mm ply thickness) of composite laminates are tested under quasi-static loading to identify compression-shear and tension-shear dominated modes of damage. After each test, the damaged plates are sectioned to visualize the extent of delamination and material damage. Numerical punch-shear experiments are conducted using LS-DYNA 970. The numerical modeling is carried out using a newly developed composite damage model, namely MAT 162, which has been incorporated into LS-DYNA. MAT 162 uses damage mechanics principle for progressive damage and material degradation. Input data required in MAT 162 have been calibrated to match the experimental results of 22-layer composite plate of both spans (25.4 and 101.6 mm). The calibrated material properties have been used to simulate other thicknesses, and the simulated results show good agreement with experiment results. It has been found that the dominant damage mechanisms are delamination and fiber breakage due to shear and tension. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Equilibrium equations that relate the delamination opening/sliding displacements to the bridging forces exerted by the Z-pins on the interlaminar crack edges are derived. The Z-pin failure meso-mechanics is explained in terms of the laminate architecture and the delamination mode. The apparent fracture toughness of Z-pinned laminates is obtained from as energy dissipated by the pull out of the through-thickness reinforcement, normalised with respect to a reference area.

          "abstract": "Composite laminates exhibit very high in-plane strengths but are plagued by delamination damage when subjected to machining. This is due to their poor transverse strengths and low delamination fracture toughness. In drilling, delamination is initiated when the thrust force exceeds a threshold value, particularly at the critical entry and exit locations of the drill bit. To minimize damage, therefore, it is important to monitor process variables such as the machining forces and the position of the tool relative to the workpiece. The availability of a suitable model coupled with an intelligent control scheme would be a large advancement in the machining of composite laminates. This paper explores the development of such models for machining of composites and for coupling the models to intelligent control strategies. Using a machining center, a series of drilling experiments were conducted on carbon fiber-reinforced composite laminates to determine key process parameters for various cutting conditions. An intelligent machining scheme is proposed as the basis for the design of a new machine tool.",

The aim of this work is to identify precisely the interlaminar interface model for ±θ interfaces, with θ=0°, 22.5° and 45° being the relative directions of the fibres of adjacent plies. This identification is based on initiation and propagation delamination tests. Our analysis of the conventional propagation tests makes use of the links existing between the critical-energy release rates and some of the model&#039;s parameters. In taking into account the part of the energy dissipated inside the layers, the interfaces can be classified into two categories: the 0°/0° interfaces of brittle behaviour, and the itnerfaces at disorientated angles whose critical-energy release rate is greater. Standard edge-delamination tension tests are also conducted and analysed in order to identify the other parameters of the interface damage model.",

          "abstract": "The Zanchor process is a novel through-thickness reinforcement technique in which in-plane yarns are entangled with each other using special needles. Mode I interlaminar fatigue crack growth behavior was investigated in carbon fiber (CF)/epoxy cross-ply laminates with Zanchor reinforcement. The laminates were molded with a Zanchor-reinforced CF dry fabric through resin film infusion (RFI). Delamination fatigue tests were carried out using double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. The threshold values of the maximum energy release rates, GImaxth, under R = 0.1 were 70 J/m2 for Zanchor 0 (base laminate without Zanchor reinforcement) and 240 J/m2 for Zancor 2 (the density of Zanchor reinforcement is twice as high as the unit density), respectively; those under R = 0.5 were 80 J/m2 for Zanchor 0 and 400 J/m2 for Zancor 2, respectively. Thus, the threshold values for Zanchor 2 were about 3.4-5 times higher than those without Zanchor reinforcement. This increase induced by Zanchor reinforcement is almost the same or higher than that obtained under static loading (3.5 times). It is common that the increase in the fracture toughness, GIc, induced by replacing the matrix resin with a tougher system only partially contributes to the increase in the fatigue threshold, GImaxth. On the other hand, the increase in GIc induced by Zanchor reinforcement was fully translated to the increase in GImaxth. This is why Zanchor 2 gives one of the highest fatigue threshold values among existing toughened composite material systems. The difference between the reinforcing effects under static and fatigue loadings was discussed in conjunction with the microscopic fracture mechanism. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, sublaminates governed by transverse shear deformable laminate theory are adopted to model such delamination. Oscillatory singular stresses around the delamination tip are avoided as a result. Instead, stress resultant jumps are found in the sublaminates across the delamination tip. It transpires that mode I, II and III energy release rates can then be obtained using the virtual crack closure technique. The results produced by this approach for a homogeneous double cantilever beam and an edge-delamination in a non-homogeneous laminate show good agreement with those available in the literature. The approach produces both total and individual components of energy release rate for delamination, which converge as the sublaminate division is refined and the sizes of the delamination tip elements decrease. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The laminate is 12-ply graphite/epoxy woven fabric L-shaped laminate subject to quasi-static loading perpendicular to one arm. Delamination initiation and propagation are observed using high speed camera and load-displacement data is recorded. The quasi-static shear loading initiates delamination at the curved region which propagates faster than the shear wave speed of the material, leading to intersonic delamination in the arms. In the numerical part, the experiments are simulated with finite element analysis and a bilinear cohesive zone model. Cohesive interface elements are used between all plies with the interface properties obtained from tests. The simulations predict a single delamination initiating at the corner under pure mode-I stress field propagating to the arms under pure mode-II stress field. The crack tip speeds transition from sub-Rayleigh to intersonic in conjunction with mode change. In addition to intersonic mode-II delamination, shear Mach waves emanating from the crack tips in the arms are observed. The simulations and experiments are found to be in good agreement at the macro-scale, in terms of load-displacement behavior and failure load, and at the meso-scale, in terms of delamination initiation location and crack propagation speeds. Finally, a mode dependent crack tip definition is proposed and observation of vibrationsduringdelaminationispresented.

          "abstract": "The fibre geometry resulting from the addition of throughthickness fibres in the form of stitching generates considerable improvement in the mode I delamination toughness of laminated carbon fibre composites. However, interlaminar shear, caused either by direct loading or from eccentricities in the structural load path resulting in out-of-plane loading, is a critical loading condition in many composite structures. This paper investigates the effect of stitching on the mode II delamination toughness. The mode II delamination toughness of a carbon/epoxy composite, both unstitched and stitched, was experimentally determined using an end-notched flexure (ENF) specimen. Specimens with varying stitch density, thread diameter and thread type were studied. The steady-state toughness, GIIRs, of unstitched and stitched specimens were compared. The addition of stitching was found to create an improvement in toughness of up to 4 times. In addition, experimental results were compared with theoretical predictions from a micromechanics-based model developed previously.",

The damage caused at the entrance of the drilled hole is characterized by delamination factor, which is evaluated by considering cutting speed, feed rate and point angle as affecting process parameters. The drilling experiments using cemented carbide (K20) twist drills were performed based on full factorial design of experiments with three levels defined for each of the process parameters. The computed values of delamination factor are empirically related to process parameters by developing a second order non-linear regression model based on response surface methodology (RSM). The effects of cutting speed, feed rate and point angle on delamination factor were analyzed using the models by generating response surface plots. The investigations reveal that the delamination tendency decrease with increase in cutting speed. The study also suggests low values of feed rate and point angle combination for reducing the damage.

The experimental buckling loads of plates are found by clamping from the two edges and then these results are compared with the results obtained by ANSYS11.0 package. In addition, the compressive failure loads of composite laminates containing multiple large delaminations are found by compression test fixture. It is found that the longest and near-surface delamination size influences the buckling load and compressive failure load of composite laminates.

Six types of laminates, chosen for the analysis are selected and described to represent a wide range of parameters. These parameters include the type of composite material (fiber and matrix), the type of laminate lay-up (unidirectional, angle ply, cross ply, and quasi-isotropic), and the loading conditions. The chapter explains the schematic diagrams showing the loading directions, layer and laminate dimensions, and stacking sequence of the laminates. The six laminates chosen for analysis by the participants are considered to be the representative of a wide range of composite laminates encountered in practical use in a variety of industries. The materials selected have been widely used in practical applications and their properties are well characterized. The chapter presents nonlinear stress-strain data and elastic constants for linear elastic analysis and discusses a wide range of practical biaxial loading conditions, which produce a variety of modes of failure. In some cases, a succession of failures may occur before the laminate can no longer carry load. In some cases, the stress-strain behavior of the laminates is expected to be linear and in some other cases, highly nonlinear.",

The dynamic delamination response under Mode I is investigated using visual and force measurements as well as numerical analysis to minimize errors due to the dynamics of this test. For loading speed larger than 3. m/s the double cantilever beam (DCB) is subjected to mixed Mode loading (Mode I/II). This result is inherent to the nature of the test and the impactor that introduced the load in the lower DCB arm. Numerical simulations show that this effect would also occur for UD laminates. Consequently the validity of the tests is limited to loading speeds below 3. m/s until which pure Mode I loading is achieved. For those loading rates optical analysis shows rate effects only at the crack initiation state which are stronger for the tufted interface. To avoid mixed mode effects at higher loading rates (&gt;3. m/s), the DCB specimen must be loaded at both arms simultaneously. Load cell recordings are not necessary as optical analysis is confirmed as a reliable technique for rate effect investigations. ?? 2012.",

This paper studies the effects of drilling parameters on the thrust force, adjusted delamination factor and compressive residual strength of uni-directional glass/epoxy resin. The design of the experiment was based on the Taguchi method. The results highlight the importance of the feed rate for maximizing the compressive residual strength of drilled laminates.

Performance in service of these composites is affected by multi-mechanism damage evolution under loading and environmental conditions. For instance, carbon fibre-reinforced laminates demonstrate a wide spectrum of failure mechanisms such as matrix cracking and delamination. These damage mechanisms can result in significant deterioration of the residual stiffness and load-bearing capacity of composite components and should be thoroughly investigated. The delamination failure mechanism is studied in this paper for a double cantilever beam (DCB) loaded in mode I. Several sensitivity studies are performed to analyse the effects of mesh density and of parameters of the cohesive law on the character of damage propagation in laminates. The microstructural randomness of laminates that is responsible for non-uniform distributions of stresses in them even under uniform loading conditions is accounted for in the model. The random properties are introduced with the use of Weibull&#039;s two-parameter probability density function. Several statistical realisations are carried out which show that the effect of microstructure could significantly affect the macroscopic response emphasizing the need to account for microstructural randomness for accurate predictions of load-carrying capacity of laminate composite structures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Delamination is among the serious concerns during drilling. Practical experience proves the advantage of using such special drills as saw drill, candle stick drill, core drill and step drill. The experimental investigation described in this paper examines the theoretical predictions of critical thrust force at the onset of delamination, and compares the effects of these different drill bits. The results confirm the analytical findings and are consistent with the industrial experience. Ultrasonic scanning is used to evaluate the extent of drilling-induced delamination. The advantage of these special drills is illustrated mathematically as well as experimentally, that their thrust force is distributed toward the drill periphery instead of being concentrated at the center. The allowable feed rate without causing delamination is also increased. The analysis can be extended to examine the effects of other future innovative drill bits. ?? 2005.",

          "abstract": "An accurate laminate model developed by using multilayer shear deformable plate modeling and interface elements, based on fracture mechanics and contact mechanics, is proposed to analyze mixed mode delamination in composite laminates. Perfect adhesion along the undelaminated portion of the delamination plane is simulated by treating interface stiffnesses as penalty parameters, whereas to enforce interface displacement continuity between plate elements constituting each sub-laminate above or below the delamination plane, the Lagrange multiplier method is used. The governing differential equations are derived through a variational procedure by using a modified total potential energy functional. Results are obtained by numerical integration of the non-linear three-point boundary value problem modeling mixed-mode delamination of the laminate plate subjected to end loading, which accounts also for the frictionless contact condition. The coupling of a penalty procedure with the Lagrange multiplier method, results in an accurate and direct energy release rate evaluation. Comparisons with results available from the literature obtained with a local continuum approach, show that mode partition may be performed to the desired accuracy by refining multilayer plate models for each sub-laminate. In addition, original analytical formulas for mode partition are obtained by coupling the interface approach and fracture mechanics concepts, evidencing the effectiveness of the proposed approach and gaining a better insight into the influence of shear effects on mode decomposition. Numerical computations for practical problems, evidence both the relative simplicity and the efficiency of the proposed model to represent mixed mode interlaminar fracturing as well as crack-face interaction. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a technique expands the design space of the laminate, and the ability to tailor local laminate properties may provide a means, for example, to mitigate stress concentrations that arise in places such as along free edges of the laminate. Preliminary fabrication of tiled laminates produced material with an elastic modulus that is nearly equal to that of continuously reinforced laminates; however, the strength of these first specimens was significantly reduced. Finite element analyses were then performed to characterize the effects of features unique to tiled composite laminates, such as the existence of resin-rich tile-to-tile interfaces, and to explore the effects of relative arrangement of tiles through the thickness of the laminate. This led to a novel composite joint geometry as well as recommendations to minimize strength reduction. Strength retention of laminates fabricated using the new design guidelines was experimentally found to exceed 92% in comparison with the traditional analogs. Finally, we discuss the potential application of composite tiling for the suppression of free-edge delamination.",

This paper presents an experimental investigation into damage occurrence in a quasi-isotropic laminate made from thin-ply, bi-axial, Non-Crimp-Fabric (NCF), under different off-axis uniaxial loadings. The NCF layers are positioned through the laminate thickness creating two regions, namely THICK and THIN (with and without ply clustering). Then, the onset and progress of three damage mechanisms (transverse matrix cracking, matrix crack induced delamination and free-edge delamination) for both regions are analyzed by monitoring the specimen&#039;s free-edge. The results show that the critical region where damage occurs is that with ply clustering (THICK), whereas delamination originating from matrix cracks or free edge effects are delayed or even suppressed in the THIN region. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Fibre metal laminates form a class of materials in which homogeneous aluminium sheets are combined with fibre reinforced prepreg layers. Intensive experimental analyses have been carried out to assess the possible application of new design methods which make use of the layered structure of fibre metal laminates. To support the experimental analyses, numerical models have been developed to describe delamination in fibre metal laminates. To achieve this goal, a special continuum element and corresponding interface elements are introduced. Loading functions have been derived to account for delamination. The loading functions are either applied for the continuum or for the interface element. Using this methodology the impact of delamination on spliced fibre metal laminates has been studied numerically and has been compared to experimental results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

The specimens with pristine nanotubes and functionalized nanotubes showed a small effect on the ILFT. The specimens with P-SWCNTs showed stable crack growth and the potential for enhanced crack bridging along with slightly higher GIc than F-SWCNT specimens. Scanning electron microscopy images showed enhanced fiber--matrix interfacial bonding in the specimens with F-SWCNTs. However, large unstable crack propagation was observed in these F-SWCNT specimens from load--displacement curves and crack propagation videos.

          "abstract": "In this paper, the damage progression and failure characteristics of stitched composites under out-of-plane loading are experimentally investigated. Test specimens, stitched with various stitch densities and stitch thread thicknesses, are studied using quasi-static indentation test. Test specimens are loaded and unloaded in 0.5. mm incremental indentation displacement to examine for damage phenomena using non-destructive inspection techniques namely ultrasonic C-scan, X-ray radiography and X-ray micro-computed tomography to elucidate complex damage mechanisms and fracture behavior. Recorded test history of load-displacement curves indicate that damage progression can be characterized into three stages: damage initiation, damage propagation and final damage failure. Results show that damage initiation occurs at a lower load in stitched composites due to the presence of resin-rich regions which act as crack initiation sites. X-ray radiography convincingly shows that stitch-induced matrix crack lines are joined between stitch loops, being particularly evident in densely stitched composites. During damage propagation, stitching becomes highly effective in suppressing delamination growth, resulting in stitched laminates having much smaller delamination area compared to unstitched laminates, and the rate of delamination growth being inversely related to stitch density. It is found out that final failure is distinguished by a sharp load drop in the load-displacement curve. It is revealed that the final failure load increases with increasing stitch fiber volume fraction. The final failure mechanism in unstitched and moderately stitched composite is mainly delamination failure; while densely stitched composite failed by indenter penetration comprising of in-plane fiber fracture and matrix crushing. Energy absorption throughout the quasi-static indentation process is presented and discussed. This work provides novel insight to the damage progression and damage penetration of stitched composites. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

This work is a study of the effect of delaminations in laminates with initial curvature. Initial curvature typically results in an increased buckling load and the hypothesis was that the reduction in compressive strength due to delamination would be less in a curved specimen than a flat one. Glass fibre reinforced plastic test laminates were manufactured containing artificial delaminations of different sizes and through thickness positions. The laminates were either flat or curved, where the plane of curvature was normal to the loading direction. Compressive load was applied to the laminates and measurements of out of plane displacements and failure loads were made. Contrary to expectations, the curved laminates gave lower failure loads than flat laminates, for the same delamination size and through thickness position. Finite element simulation was carried out to predict out of plane displacement and failure load, with failure being assessed using a maximum stress criterion. Good agreement between finite element predictions and experimental measurements of load versus deflection behaviour was observed for both flat and curved laminates. Ultimate failure loads were also well predicted for the flat laminates but relatively poorly for the curved laminates. The finite element predictions depend on modelling accurately the out of plane displacement behaviour, which was found to be very sensitive to the boundary conditions for the case of curved laminates. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The loss in toughness occurs most rapidly at temperatures that are close to the strain point of the matrix phase; this represents the life-limiting temperature for this class of composites.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a study on delamination growth in Mode I, Mode II and mixed mode under fatigue loading in an HTA/6376C composite. The computed slopes of the modified Paris plots were high. Therefore, threshold values of the strain energy release rate for delamination growth were determined. Low fatigue threshold values revealed a significant effect of fatigue loading. The largest effect was found for the ENF test (Mode II) for which the fatigue threshold value was only 10% of the critical strain energy release rate in static tests. Threshold values for MMB (mixed mode) and DCB (Mode I) tests were 15% and 23% of the static values, respectively. Fractographic evaluation revealed identical initial failure mechanisms in fatigue and static loading conditions for the ENF specimen. The ENF specimen failed by formation and coalescence of microcracks. The low fatigue threshold for the ENF specimen was explained by microscopical observations on the specimen edge. It was also shown that the fracture surfaces generated in static and fatigue DCB and MMB tests were similar.",

For this, data from round robin tests conducted at the authors laboratories will be complemented by selected results from literature. Questions related to delamination resistance of CFRP composites with implications for composite structural design and testing include, e.g., the determination of threshold values in cyclic fatigue, the question of conservative mode (mode I versus mode II), approaches for data analysis, and possible analogies in short crack cyclic fatigue between fracture behavior of structural metal alloys and CFRP. The scatter in Paris-type law data analysis of cyclic fatigue tests and the resulting apparent threshold behavior that has implications for composite structural design will be presented. Load measurement resolution yields the major contribution to scatter in displacement controlled fatigue tests. The analogous displacement resolution for load controlled tests is discussed and limitations in test control and of power law displacement data fitting for analysis are pointed out.",

The specimen thickness and lay-up sequence had little effect on the through-the-thickness water absorption behavior of composite laminates, but the other parameters affected the moisture absorption rate and equilibrium water uptake in different ways and intensities. The glass transition temperature of composite laminates was strongly affected and linearly decreased by the quantity of equilibrium water uptake. A characteristic length of moisture migration through the unidirectional laminates was proposed as a function of fiber angle to the exposed laminate surface. In this approach, the fibers imbedded in the matrix were assumed to act as a barrier to the penetrating water molecules, and the developed model was well compared with the experimental results.",

They are often investigated separately, and so the interaction between two damage modes has not yet been revealed. In this paper, a simple parallel-spring model is introduced to model the longitudinal stiffness reduction due to matrix cracking and edge delamination together. The energy release rate of edge delamination eliminating the matrix crack effect and the energy release rate of matrix cracking in the presence of edge delamination are then obtained. Experimental materials include carbon- and glass-fibre-reinforced bismaleimide composite laminates under static tension. The growth of matrix cracks and edge delaminations was recorded by means of NDT techniques. Results show that matrix cracks may initiate before or after edge lamination. This depends on the laminate layup, and especially on the thickness of the 90?? plies. Edge delamination may also induce matrix cracking. Matrix cracking has a significant effect on the stiffness reduction in GRP laminates. The present model can predict the stiffness reduction in a laminate containing both matrix cracks and edge delaminations. The mixed-mode delamination fracture toughness obtained from the present model shows up to 50% differences compared with O&#039;Brien&#039;s model for GRP laminates. However, matrix cracking has a small effect on the mixed-mode interlaminar fracture toughness of the CFRP laminates. ?? 1994.",

The technique, which consists of two line scans, is as follows. The first scan measures the arrival times of the transmitted S0 mode along the 0?? direction to detect delamination and evaluate its size. The second scan measures the maximum amplitude of the earliest wave packet in a line, including the longest delamination, to locate its edge. We performed this technique on impacted CFRP cross-ply laminates. A remarkable decrease in the arrival times due to the delamination is detected, and the delamination length can be calculated based on a simple model for Lamb-wave propagation. Furthermore, the delamination edge is located as a sudden decrease in the amplitude. The technique enables detecting the delamination and evaluating its size and location using only the two scans. We demonstrated the validity and usefulness of this technique. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have shown the severe limitations that have to be placed on machining forces when drilling composite laminates due to their propensity for delamination. Delamination, which consists of separation between the plys in a laminate, is due to the relatively poor strength of these materials in the thickness direction. In drilling, delamination is initiated when the drilling force exceeds a threshold value, particularly at the critical entry and exit locations of the drill bit. While abrasive machining results in damage-free holes in most composites, such processes are slow and expensive when compared to drilling with conventional twist drills. Here it is shown that the chisel edge in such drills is a major contributor to the thrust force that is the primary cause of delamination when drilling composite laminates. In this study, a series of drilling experiments were conducted on carbon fiber-reinforced composite laminates to determine quantitatively the effect of the chisel edge on the thrust force. In addition, tests were conducted to determine the effect of pre-drilling the laminate with a pilot hole. The results show a large reduction in the thrust force when a pilot hole is present which, in effect, removes the chisel edge contribution. An analytical model that incorporates the presence of a pilot hole is also described. The results from the thrust force-feed relationships show good agreement with experimentally determined values for the thrust force for a wide range of feeds for drilling tests conducted on laminates with and without pilot holes.",

          "abstract": "A three-dimensional finite element model is created to simulate a mechanically fastened joint in a composite laminate. Using the results from the finite element model, a spline approximation for the through-thickness stress is applied in order to determine the stress state at the interfaces between the layers. A delamination onset criterion is then applied at each interface. After validation, the model is used to assess the effects of stacking sequence and clamping pressure on the delamination onset loads and surfaces. It is concluded that &quot;blocked&quot; laminates lead to lower delamination onset loads and larger initial delaminated regions. Finger-tight and clamped joints have higher delamination onset loads and smaller initial cracked regions than pin-loaded joints. These results are in agreement with experimental observations, but no significant difference is detected between finger-tight and clamped joints. It is therefore concluded that the through-thickness pressure has an effect not only on damage initiation but also on damage growth, as well as in the load transferred by friction between the washer and the laminate.",

Through the thickness delamination phenomena in unidirectional composite laminates are analyzed in the context of the interface methodology, based on the combination of shear deformable beams and interface elements. Analytical solutions of the relevant governing equations are proposed and closed-form expressions for simple cases, involving pure mode I and mode II components, are provided. Moreover, analytical expressions for mixed mode loading conditions regarding the energy release rate modal components are given in terms of beam stress resultant discontinuities, emphasizing the presence of new terms, absent in the static case, which arise from the inertial description of the composite structure. Comparisons between analytical and numerical results show the accuracy of the proposed formulation. Some applications are developed to point out the influence of the crack front speed, the shear deformability, the inertial contributions on the energy release rate and the corresponding mode partition. Special attention is devoted to analyze the maximum speeds of the moving crack. In particular, a parametric study in terms of the main characteristic geometric parameters of the laminate is proposed to show the main features of the crack tip behavior. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

In order to conduct experiments a setup is designed and fabricated to apply both vibrations and rotation to drill bits. Using Taguchi method, a set of experiments is conducted with feed rate, spindle speed, and ultrasonic vibration amplitude as control factors.

          "abstract": "Machining of composites has caught greater attention in manufacturing of structural parts in aerospace, automobile and sporting goods. Composite materials have advantageous features in strength and stiffness coupled with lightweight compared to the conventional metallic materials. Amongst all machining operations, drilling is the most commonly applied method for generating holes for riveting and fastening the structural assembly. Delamination is one of the serious concerns in drilling holes in composite materials at the bottom surface of the workpiece (drill exit). Quite a few references of the drilling of fiber-reinforced plastics report that the quality of cut is strongly dependent on drilling parameter as well as the drill geometry. Saw drills and core drills produce less delamination than twist drills by distributing the drilling thrust toward the hole periphery. Delamination can be effectively reduced or eliminated by slowing down the feed rate when approaching the exit and by using back-up plates to support and counteract the deflection of the composite laminate leading to exit side delaminations. The use of the back-up does reduce the delamination in practice, which its effects have not been well explained in analytical fashion. This paper predicts the effects of backup plate on delamination in drilling composite materials using saw drill and core drill. The critical drilling thrust force at the onset of delamination is calculated and compared with that without backup. The well known advantage of industrial use of backup can be understood fundamentally by the fact that the threshold thrust force at the onset of delamination is increased making the delamination less induced. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

On the edge of laminates, out-of-plane stresses arise, even up to material failure. Layer thickness is also known as influencing delamination onset stress. Making use of (i) a conventional model assuming plies homogeneity, damageable elastic behaviour, plane interlaminar surface also infinite interfacial stiffness and (ii) a local stress tensor correction near the edge, allows an efficient calculation of the full stress tensor, thanks to an asymptotic method. Then, a stress criterion was studied. The assessment of criterion parameters from test results was based on conjugate gradient method and experimental thickness effect. Edge delamination tests were performed on several specimens with various lay-ups and loaded under interlaminar shear, tension and compression. Acoustic emission was used to detect delamination initiation. As expected, these tests have exhibited layer thickness influence on onset stress. The assessment of shear and tension parameters shows good agreement between theory and experimental results. But the influence of interlaminar compressive stresses seems insufficiently taken into account in the criterion formulation. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The analysis is performed within the framework of the finite deformation theory of elasticity to account for the nonlinear stiffening of the thin composite plate and the large rotations which accompany the fracture process. The simulation is dynamic and uses an explicit time stepping scheme. Comparison with existing experiments performed on graphite/epoxy laminates indicates that the cohesive/volumetric finite element scheme is able to capture the complex mechanisms leading to the delamination, including the initial micro-cracking of the matrix, the appearance of critical transverse matrix cracks and the rapid propagation of delamination cracks initiated at the intersections between the critical matrix cracks and the adjacent plies.",

          "abstract": "The present study deals with numerical and experimental investigations on free vibration behavior of woven fiber Glass/Epoxy delaminated composite plates subjected to elevated temperatures and moistures. A composite plate model based on first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) with provision of mid plane square delamination is considered for free vibration of delaminated composite plates subjected to hygrothermal loading. An eight noded quadratic isoparametric element with five degrees of freedom per node is used in the formulation. A series of experiments is conducted to obtain natural frequencies of vibration for woven fiber Glass/Epoxy delaminated composite plates using B&amp;K FFT analyzer with PULSE software, which agree reasonably well with the numerical values. Teflon film is embedded in the laminate, simulating the presence of delamination. The effects of temperature, moisture, delamination size and different boundary conditions on the natural frequencies of composite plates are investigated. The results indicate that the vibration behavior is greatly influenced by the delamination and hygrothermal parameters involved in the study.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of new high-performance thermoplastics to replace thermosets in fiber-reinforced polymers puts up a new challenge: their machining. In this study, carbon fiber-reinforced poly-cyclic butylene terephthalate laminates were manufactured, drilled, and inspected. Different commercial drill geometries and machining conditions were compared. Roughness, microscopy, and non-destructive tests allowed us to determine the hole quality as well as delamination. The surface tests showed better results after working at the most common cutting speed (3000 rpm) than at high speed (15,000 rpm) with a constant feed rate. This fact can be explained based on the viscoelastic properties of the matrix that becomes fragile at high cutting speeds. The Delamination factor obtained by means of Ultrasonics and X-ray Computed Tomography also confirmed that the best results are achieved with a Twist drill bit at 3000 rpm. In contrast to carbon fiber-reinforced thermosets, the detected delamination at high cutting speeds is not as remarkable as expected. These results allow us to conclude that this new composite will certainly increase production rate without delamination damage. Chip formation takes also a special role. It can be recovered to be used as reinforcement in manufacturing processes due to the recyclability of the thermoplastic matrix.",

          "abstract": "One of the causes of a reduction in the compressive strength of a composite material containing delaminations is the buckling of the delaminated plies. To understand the effect of delamination geometry on the compressive behaviour of laminated composite materials, compression tests were carried out on glass-fibre-reinforced plastic (GRP) test specimens containing artificial delaminations of various geometry, created by inserting PTFE film into the laminate during lay-up. Finite-element modelling was also carried out to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of compressive failure. Good agreement between finite-element predictions and experimental measurements were found for the whole range of delamination geometries that were tested. Finite-element and simple closed-form models were also developed for delaminated panels with isotropic properties. This enabled a study of the effect of delamination geometry on compressive failure without the complicating effects of orthotropic material properties. The results of this study can be used to derive a graph of non-dimensional failure load versus non-dimensional failure stress, where the results for any one delamination geometry superimpose on those for all others. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Since delaminations of composite laminates are usually invisible or difficult to detect by visual inspections, delamination causes low reliability for primary structures. Automatic systems for delamination identifications in-service are desired in order to improve this low reliability. The present study employs an electric resistance change method for detection of delaminations. Since the method adopts reinforcement carbon fibre itself as sensors for delamination detections, this method does not cause reduction of static strength or fatigue strength; also, this method is applicable to existing structures. In the present study, a relationship between fibre volume fraction and orthotropic electric conductivities is confirmed by experimentation and the effect of measured orthotropic electric conductance on delamination monitoring is discussed analytically with FEM analyses. Two types of cross-ply laminates are prepared for delamination monitoring analyses: [0/90]s and [90/0]s. Electric resistance changes due to delamination creation are discussed for both specimen types with results of electric current density diagrams. As a result, it can be concluded that the fibre volume fraction has a large effect on electric conductance of the transverse and thickness directions, and electric conductance of the thickness direction has significant effects on delamination detection with the electric resistance change method. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "The dynamic delamination in woven glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP) composite is studied with a 3D finite deformation anisotropic viscoplastic model in conjunction with contact/cohesive laws. The large deformation of the material during impact loading is described through an anisotropic plasticity model in total Lagrangian co-ordinates whose coefficients are determined experimentally. The interaction between lamina is analyzed through a contact/interface model. The tensile and shear tractions in zero thickness interface elements, embedded between lamina, are calculated from interface cohesive law. The interface cohesive law describes the evolution of these tractions in terms of normal and tangential displacement jumps and other interface parameters. The compressive traction at the interface is calculated through the impenetrability conditions employed in the contact module. Once the effective displacement jump exceeds a specified critical value, the interface elements are assumed to have failed, i.e., delamination is said to have taken place. Three interface cohesive laws are proposed to describe the delamination process. It is assumed that loading of interface takes place reversibly up to a specified value of the displacement jump followed by irreversible loading beyond this value. This feature represents a partial damage of the interface in the event of unloading. Dynamic delamination in the woven GRP composite is studied through analyses of plate-on-plate impact experiments. The heterogeneity of composite materials leading to wave dispersion and scattering is modeled by considering a layered composition of the GRP plate. Each lamina is assumed to be made of three layers of materials. The middle layer of half the thickness of lamina is considered as GRP and the two end layers of equal thicknesses are considered to be of matrix material, i.e., polyester resin. The possible delamination of the composite material under compressive shock loading is shown to occur due to local shear effects. This is modeled by considering waviness of the interface between lamina. Interfaces with flat as well as two types of wavy structures are analyzed. Analyses are carried out to establish the effect of critical displacement jump, mixed mode coupling parameter employed in interface laws, interface waviness and the effect of interface laws. The response of GRP composite during impact is characterized in terms of the free surface velocity, delamination event vs. time and interface normal and shear stresses. The interface normal and shear stresses are obtained directly from the interface cohesive laws, as well as, by extrapolating continuum stresses from integration points of the neighboring triangular elements to the interface. It is shown that the finite element model predicts the response of the material in confirmation with available experimental results. The wave dispersion and scattering effects are obtained in the form of attenuation of shock stress and free surface velocity. The model predicts partial delamination during compressive shock loading above a certain threshold due to local shear and mode coupling. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

Complementary finite element analysis was carried out showing the influence of angular misalignments of fiber/matrix delaminations on the laminate stiffness. Fatigue tests were performed in load control for R = 0.05 and R = --1, with a loading frequency of 10 Hz, at room temperature.

Such relations are of particular interest in fracture of laminates consisting of layers of different fiber orientations. In this study, an iterative method based on internal strain measurements and parametric numerical modeling is employed to identify a traction-separation relation in quasi-static mode I dominated delamination of a cross-ply carbon fiber epoxy laminate. The results demonstrate that crack propagation is accompanied by a large bridging zone which is smaller than the zone in a uniaxial composite specimen of the same materials and linear dimensions. While the initiation value of the energy release rate (ERR) is the same, the ERR at steady state propagation and the maximum stress in the bridging zone are respectively 1.7 and 3.1 times larger than the corresponding values of the unidirectional specimen.

Graphite/epoxy prepreg of T800/3900-2 was selected for fabricating the laminates for the tests. The tensile strength and failure response of specimens with an open hole and a bolt-filled hole were evaluated. Both 100% bypass load (no bolt bearing load) and no bypass load (100% bolt bearing load) were considered during the experiments. X-radiographs were taken for specimens after pre-loading at different stress levels for the purpose of characterizing the failure modes and damage progression inside the composite. Experimental results showed that the bolt clamping force can significantly reduce the notch tensile strength of composite laminates which are prone to fiber-matrix splitting and delamination. A reduction in failure load of up to 20% was observed. Higher clamping pressure resulted in higher reductions of notch strength. However, for bolted joints which failed in a net-tension mode, clamping improved the joint strength regardless of the ply orientation.",

Translaminar (fibre direction) mode I fracture toughness has recently been experimentally determined to be thickness dependent. This paper presents a computational study of the tensile strength prediction of open-hole laminates using a cohesive zone model. To the authors&#039; knowledge, it is for the first time in the literature that the thickness-dependence of translaminar fracture toughness is accounted for in the numerical modelling of composites. The thickness size effect in the strength of open-hole composite laminates failed by pull-out is accurately predicted for the first time by a deterministic model. It is found that neglecting delamination in the numerical models will lead to mesh-dependency and over-estimation on the predicted strength. Smeared crack model with cohesive elements to model delamination is able to predict the correct failure mode; but it is found not suitable for accurate strength predictions for laminates failed by delamination. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus of present experimental work is to understand the cutting mechanism and relative effect of cutting parameters and tool geometry on the delamination and burr formation during drilling of GLARE. Thrust force, torque and acoustic emission (AE) signals were acquired for analyzing the cutting mechanism, burr and delamination formation. Also, several measurements of burrs, delamination and hole size were taken in order to understand the hole quality. It has been observed that, 2-fluted drill is the best out of four different geometries used, giving zero delamination and acceptable burr formation followed by the 4-faceted drills. The conventional 3-fluted and 8-faceted drills that are otherwise superior for drilling of fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) composites, performed poorly in drilling of the GLARE laminates. Analyzing the processing parameters, feed again has a dominant role in controlling delamination and burr formation than speed.",

          "abstract": "Delamination is a well-recognized problem associated with drilling fiber-reinforced composite materials (FRCMs). The most noted problems occur as the drill enters and exits the FRCM. Since drilling is often a final operation during assembly, any defects introduced in parts through the drilling process that result in the part being rejected represent an expensive loss. Studies based on linear-elastic fracture mechanics theory have proposed critical cutting and thrust forces in the various drilling regions that can be used as a guide in preventing crack growth or delamination. Using these critical force curves as a guide, a thrust force controller was developed to minimize the delamination while drilling a graphite-epoxy laminate. A neural network control scheme was implemented which required a neural network identifier to model the drilling dynamics and a neural network controller to learn the relationship between feed rate and the desired thrust force. Experimental results verifying the validity of this control approach as well as the robustness of the design are presented. Visual measurements of the delamination zones were used to quantify the benefits of the thrust force controlled drilling process versus the conventional constant feed rate drilling process.

The reduction to the compression modulus, strength and fatigue performance of carbon/epoxy laminates with increasing volume content and diameter of pins is determined. The elastic modulus decreases at a quasi-linear rate with increasing pin content and pin diameter. Softening is caused by fiber waviness around the pins and reduced fiber volume content due to volumetric swelling of the laminate from the pins. A simple model is presented for calculating the compression modulus of pinned laminates that considers the softening effects of fiber waviness and fiber dilution. The compression strength and fatigue life also decrease with increasing volume content and diameter of the pins. The strength and fatigue properties are reduced by fiber kinking caused by fiber waviness around the pins and the reduced fiber content caused by swelling. The deterioration to the compression properties is also dependent on the fiber lay-up pattern of the laminate, with the magnitude of the loss in properties increasing with the percentage of 0° (load bearing) fibers in the laminate.

Through-thickness reinforcement in the form of transverse stitching is an effective way to suppress delamination in these composite laminates. In this paper, the effect of stitching on Mode II delamination toughness is analysed by using two specimen geometries, namely, the end-notch flexure (ENF) specimen geometry and the end-notch cantilever (ENC) specimen geometry. The ENC specimen geometry allows larger crack propagation lengths which may be necessary to develop fully the stitch-thread bridging zone in the case of compliant stitch threads. Initially the energy release rate, GII(??a), is determined by the contour integral method and then the use and equivalence of the stress intensity factor approach is demonstrated. The effect of stitching on both specimen geometries is found to be the same, and identical closed form analytical expressions are obtained for the potential energy release rate, GIIR(??a), required for crack propagation. The effect of stitching is expressed in terms of the stitching parameters ?? and ??. The influence of friction between the crack surfaces is also included in the analysis. A simple design study for sizing the ENF and ENC specimens to minimise geometric non-linear response is presented. The effects of the stitching parameters and various geometric and material properties are examined. ?? 1995.",

Delamination is mostly considered as the principal failure model in drilling of composite materials. Drill wear is a serious concern in hole-making industry, as it is necessary to prevent damage of cutting tools, machine tools and workpieces. The industrial experience shows the worn drill causes more delamination. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of delamination caused by the drill wear for twist drill in drilling carbon fiber-reinforced composite materials. The critical thrust force at the onset of delamination for worn drill is predicted and compared with that of ideal drill. The experimental results demonstrate that though the critical thrust force is higher with increasing wear ratio, the delamination becomes more liable to occur because the actual thrust force increases to larger extent, as the thrust factor (Z) illustrates. Compared to sharp drill, the worn twist drill allows for lower feed rate below which the delamination damage can be avoided. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The Palmgren-Miner rule has been shown to be inexact in many cases for various composite materials. Several empirical models have been conceived to account for this discrepancy, as well as the effect of block sequence. The approach taken here is based on the underlying mechanisms. A cross-ply laminate was used as a model material. In general, composites show both initiatory and progressive mechanisms under fatigue loading. The former is active at high static stresses, whereas the latter predominates at lower stress amplitudes where they are given sufficient time to propagate. Initiatory mechanisms give rise to damage from which the progressive mechanisms can start, and conversely the progressive mechanisms continually alter the local stress state which results in further damage accumulation caused by the initiation controlled mechanisms. In a cross-ply laminate, the initiatory mechanism is the formation of transverse cracks, and the progressive mechanism is mainly delamination growth initiated from the transverse cracks. In an experimental investigation of carbon fiber/epoxy cross-ply laminates, the interaction of these mechanisms has shown why a sequence of high-low amplitude levels results in shorter lifetimes than a low-high order. Such a sequence effect seems to be a common behavior for many other composite materials, and can be mechanistically explained by a similar kind of interaction. Advantages and drawbacks of the mechanistic approach compared with empirical rules are also discussed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Previous works have already proved that this mesomodel can be interpreted as the homogenized result of micromodels involving common microdamage mechanisms: transverse microcracking, delamination at the tips of transverse microcracks and fiber-matrix debonding. Here, we are going one step further by considering microcracking in skin plies of various thicknesses. To fit experimental results better, we introduced a modification of the coupling of the three microdamage scenarios in all plies. Contrary to the classical approach, the critical values of the energy release rate are not associated with a healthy material but with a damaged material; the first damage mechanism to occur is associated with non-transverse microcracks due to nearly uniformly distributed fiber-matrix debonding in the damaged ply. These mechanisms and this coupling are homogenized on the mesoscale, which leads to an improved version of the &quot;damage mesomodel for laminates&quot; involving only a small number of material constants which can be interpreted on the microscale. Thickness effects are taken into account: the improved version, unlike the previous one, is valid for arbitrary values of the thickness.

Drilling is often necessary to assemble different components, but this can lead to various forms of damage, such as delamination which is the most severe. However, a reduced thrust force can decrease the risk of delamination. In this work, two variables of the drilling process were compared: tool material and geometry, as well as the effect of feed rate and cutting speed. The parameters that were analyzed include: thrust force, delamination extension and mechanical strength through open-hole tensile test, bearing test, and flexural test on drilled plates. The present work shows that a proper combination of all the factors involved in drilling operations, like tool material, tool geometry and cutting parameters, such as feed rate or cutting speed, can lead to the reduction of delamination damage and, consequently, to the enhancement of the mechanical properties of laminated parts in complex structures, evaluated by open-hole, bearing, or flexural tests.",

The constitutive model is based on the assumption that the composite material is transversely isotropic, and accounts for the effects of crack closure under load reversal cycles. The damage model is implemented in an implicit finite element code taking into account the requirement to ensure a mesh-independent computation of the dissipated energy. The comparison between the model predictions and published experimental data indicates that the model can accurately predict the effects of transverse matrix cracks on the residual stiffness of quasi-isotropic laminates, the interaction between transverse matrix cracks and delamination, and final failure of the laminate.",

In an effort to further understand the impact response of composite laminates, various degrees of impact ranging from subperforation to perforation were introduced to glass/epoxy laminates through an instrumented drop-weight impactor. In addition, composite laminates of various in-plane dimensions and thicknesses were examined for in-plane dimensional and thickness effects, respectively. Experimental results showed that in-plane dimensional effect was not as significant as thickness effect. The impacted composite laminates were then subjected to compression after impact (CAI) tests for characterizations of residual mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that perforation was the most important damage stage in composite laminates subjected to impact loading since impact characteristics (peak force, contact duration and absorbed energy) and mechanical properties degradation (residual compressive maximum force and residual compressive absorbed energy) of composite laminates became stable once perforation took place. However, it was also found that delamination played a very important role in the characterizations of mechanical properties degradation. Since the impact response of composite laminates is due to plate bending to some extent, bending analysis was used to explain the greater influence of thickness effect to in-plane dimensional effect. It was also found that bending analysis was feasible for interpretation of delamination in mechanical properties degradation.",

Metallographic microscopy was used to observe the damage characteristics of the perpendicular cross-section of the impacted laminates after a micropowder polishing treatment. When the load–time and the energy–time histories were compared with the fractographics, it was found that fiber breakage had occurred prior to the major damage.

          "abstract": "Drilling is the most commonly applied method for hole making of fiber-reinforced materials owing to the need for structure joining. Delamination is the most common defect during drilling because of the heterogeneity of both the fibers and the matrix. The delamination, in general, is an irregular shape and size, containing long and fine breaks and cracks at the exit of the drilled hole, especially in the drilling of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). On the other hand, a core-saw drill is designed to reduce the threat of chip removal in drilling composite materials. Since the thrust force of core-saw drill is distributed toward the periphery, the core-saw drill allows a larger critical thrust force than the twist drill at the onset of delamination when drilling composite materials. The aim of this paper is to present a novel approach of the equivalent delamination factor (F ed) to characterize drilling-induced delamination using a core- saw drill and compare it with the adjusted delamination factor (F da) and the conventional delamination factor (F a). The experimental results indicated that the F ed obtained is considered suitable for characterizing delamination at the exit of a hole after drilling CFRP. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.",

In the present study, a wireless system using a tiny oscillation circuit for detecting delamination of carbon/epoxy composites is proposed. In this system, a tiny oscillation circuit is attached to the composite component. When delamination of the component occurs, electrical resistance changes, which causes a change in the oscillating frequency of the circuit. Since this system uses the composite structure itself as a sensor and the oscillating circuit is very small, it is applicable to rotating components. The electrical resistance change and oscillating frequency change due to delamination is experimentally measured using carbon/epoxy specimens. The effects of temperature changes are also measured. The wireless method is found to successfully detect embedded delamination, and to estimate the size of the delamination. The effect of temperature change is minimized by means of a temperature compensation circuit. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The FMLs were based on an aluminum alloy, a self-reinforced polypropylene composite and a polypropylene film acting as an interlayer adhesive. The investigation focuses on the feasibility of using scale models to predict the full-scale behavior of laminates based on [Aln, 0??/90??n]s and [Aln, ??45??n]s stacking configurations. Tensile tests were undertaken on laminates that were prepared using three different scaling approaches, these being 1D (scaling the thickness dimension), 2D (scaling the in-plane dimensions) and 3D scaling where all of the dimensions were scaled appropriately. Geometrical effects were investigated by monitoring the stiffness, strength, strain to failure and the stress/strain response of the FMLs. In the 1D and 3D-scaled samples, a small decrease in tensile strength was observed with increasing scale size, an effect that was associated with a change in failure mode from tensile fracture to interply delamination. In contrast, the strength of the 2D-scaled samples increased with increasing scale size, an effect that was attributed to the decreasing influence of edge delaminations in the larger test samples. The elastic modulus of the fiber-metal laminates did not exhibit any scale effect, remaining roughly constant over the four sizes of specimen considered here. ?? 2006.",

The material system investigated was a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composite. The thermomechanical properties required for the analysis were obtained from tests on unidirectional laminates. The laminates investigated for damage initiation and growth were [30/-30/90]s and [0/??45/90]s. Mechanical testing was conducted at 23 ??C and -196 ??C. The microcrack and delamination were determined using acoustic emission and/or small incremental step loadings. The residual stresses due to difference in curing and test temperatures were calculated using classical laminated plate theory with thermo-mechanical properties generated, and their effect on the initiation of damage was assessed. The stress levels at the initiation of microcrack and delamination determined by experiment were compared with analytical predictions using the maximum stress criteria. The interlaminar free-edge stresses were analyzed using a global-local model. The results of this stress analysis were compared with the experimental results. While the residual stresses increase with decreasing test temperature, so do the composite transverse and shear strengths, and these two effects compete in their influence on the stress at onset of initial damage. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A plan of experiments, based on the techniques of Taguchi, was established considering drilling with prefixed cutting parameters in an autoclave CFRP composite laminate. The analysis of variance was preformed to investigate the cutting characteristics of CFRPs using cemented carbide (K10) drills with appropriate geometries. The objective was to establish a correlation between cutting velocity and feed rate with the power (Pc) specific cutting pressure (Ks) and delamination factor (Fd) in a CFRP material.

An analytical model was proposed for determining the response of the laminates containing a matrix crack-induced delamination and subjected to a concentrated load through a spherical indenter. Two types of matrix cracks were considered in the model: a surface-bending crack and an internal shear crack. The model consists of three parts: a stress analysis, a contact analysis, and a failure analysis. A nonlinear three-dimensional finite element model based on an updated Lagrange formulation was developed for calculating stresses and strains in composites. An augmented Lagrangian method was utilized to simulate the interfacial contact condition of the embedded delamination and the indentation between the composite and the indenter. Fracture mechanics was applied to predict the delamination growth in three dimensions. In order to verify the model, results of the calculations from the analysis were compared with the existing solutions and test data available in the literature. Experiments were also conducted to further substantiate the model and the predictions from the analysis. Overall, the predictions agreed well with the existing solutions and the test data.",

For the type of impact damage and laminate configuration investigated in this study the fatigue limit is found to be 60% CSAI (compression strength after impact) in constant-amplitude compression-compression loading, and 65% CSAI under the spectrum loading conditions.

However, direct measurement of the bridging tractions is a challenging task. In this work, an iterative methodology based on internal strain measurements and parametric finite element modeling is employed to identify the contribution of fiber bridging to delamination resistance of unidirectional carbon fiber/epoxy laminates. Double cantilever beam specimens with integrated arrays of wavelength-multiplexed fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) are subjected to mode I loading. Non-uniform strain distribution in the vicinity of the interlaminar crack plane is locally monitored by means of the several embedded FBG sensors of 1 mm gauge length. Employing an inverse identification procedure, the measured strain data are used to determine the bridging tractions associated with delimitation growth. It is shown that such an iterative procedure can be effectively applied for characterization of the energy release rate due to the fiber bridging in specimens of different thicknesses. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2014.",

Correlations are established between resistance to and tolerance of impact damage and the delamination resistance of composites. Salient differences are identified between composites made from different fibre configurations in terms of the process of damage development, damage modes/states and residual performance after impact damage. The effects of fibre/matrix interface properties influenced by different silane coupling agents on interlaminar fracture and the impact performance of woven-glass-fabric composites are evaluated. The implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the analysis of elastic waves generated by localized dynamic sources in structural composites. The source can be external, involving acoustic wave loading as in the so called leaky Lamb wave experiment, and low-velocity foreign object impact on the surface of the structure, or internal, as in sudden crack initiation and its rapid growth from existing internal flaws. All three problems are of critical importance in the safe operation of composite structures, due to their vulnerability to hidden delaminations that can occur in composite materials when they are subjected to this type of loads. It is well known that both the dynamic surface loading associated with impact, and the sudden &quot;opening&quot; of an internal crack associated with the extension of a preexisting flaw act as sources of elastic waves in the material of the structure. The research reported here consists of model-based analysis of the guided waves generated by surface loading and microcrack initiation in graphite epoxy composite laminates commonly used in aircraft and aerospace structures. The objective of this study is to develop a mechanics based understanding of the causal relationship between the properties of the source and the characteristics of the waves generated by its initiation and propagation. The results of this research are expected to be useful in developing effective health monitoring systems for new as well as aging aircraft and aerospace structures. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, each layup had different percentages of crack-opening and shear-mode strain-energy-release rates, GI and GII, respectively. Results with composites made from T300 graphite fibers and 5208 epoxy, a brittle resin, indicated that only GI contributed to delamination onset under static loading. However, results with composites made from C6000 fibers and H205 epoxy, a tougher resin, indicated that the total G governed the onset of edge delaminations under cyclic loads. In addition, for both materials, the threshold level of G for delamination onset in fatigue was significantly less than the critical Gc measured in static tests. Furthermore, although the C6000/H205 material had a much higher static Gc than T300/5208, its fatigue resistance was only slightly better. A series of mixed-mode tests, like the ones in this study, may be needed to evaluate toughened-resin composites developed for highly strained composite structures subjected to cyclic loads.",

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0degrees/90degrees] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies. Predictions of residual velocity, development of deformation and delamination correlate well with experimental results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Two different types of polymer-matrix-based Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic laminates were selected to evaluate the effect of resin properties on bearing response. A special measurement system using a non-contact electro-optical extensometer to measure hole elongation is proposed. During static tensile testing, the response of bearing damage was monitored by acoustic emission measurement. Several specimens were observed by means of soft X-ray radiography and SEM at different loading levels to assess internal damage. The observations indicate that the bearing failure can be outlined as a process of compressive damage accumulation, and can be divided into the following four stages: Damage onset; damage growth; local fracture; structural fracture. Major features of bearing failure include fiber micro-buckling, matrix cracking, delamination and out-of-plane shear cracking. Bearing strength and failure mode should also depend on the lateral constraints and the &quot;toughness&quot; of different polymer-matrix based laminates. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Thin-ply composites are rapidly gaining interest in the composite industry, not only because of the larger design possibilities that they offer, but also because of positive size effects that have been shown to improve performance in various loading conditions [1]. In this work, carbon fiber-epoxy composites of different ply thicknesses (30-300g/m2 fiber areal weight) were produced from the same batch of Toray M40JB fiber and NorthTPT TP80ep matrix to study the influence of ply thickness on the ultimate strength and on the onset of damage in lamina, laminates and components. Uniaxial tension, open-hole compression and open-hole tensile fatigue tests on quasi isotropic [45??/90??/-45??/0??]ns laminates showed very significant improvements regarding the on-set of damage, and in some cases ultimate strength, when decreasing the ply thickness. These performance improvements are the result of major changes in the damage progression and failure modes of the laminates caused by a systematic delay or near suppression of transverse cracking and delamination growth in thin-ply composites. On the component level, thin-ply laminates enabled a marked improvement for bolted-joint bearing, especially in hot-wet conditions. Under impact, the 30??m thin ply laminate exhibited a quasi-brittle failure with extensive translaminar cracking while a ply thickness of 100??m was found as optimum to minimize the projected damage area. Ply thickness scaling of transverse and in-plane shear strength was identified based on classical laminate theory and unnotched tensile tests on quasi-isotropic specimens. The empirical scaling was found to follow a linear trend over a range of ply thicknesses from 30 to 250??m. Due to the near suppression of delamination, the strength of thin-ply composites could then be modeled more effectively than thick ply composites using classical laminate theory or standard multilayer shell modeling. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

The distribution of the local strain energy release rate along the delamination front is obtained via the virtual crack closure technique applied to three-dimensional (3D) finite element models of circular delaminations embedded in woven and nonwoven composite laminates. In each case, the delamination is embedded at a different depth along the thickness direction of the laminates. The fibre orientation of the plies bounding the delamination significantly influences the distribution of the local strain energy release rate. There is general qualitative agreement between the predicted directions of delamination growth and C-scan results of the embedded delaminations. It is found that residual thermal stresses have a significant effect on the onset of buckling of the delaminated sublaminate, but negligible influence on the distribution of the local strain energy release rate in the postbuckled regime. Furthermore, the effect of residual thermal stresses is more pronounced for delaminations that are closer to the surface. A method for the prediction of delamination areas and directions using fatigue growth criteria derived from test coupon data is also presented. It is found that growth criteria based on components of the strain energy release rate predict the rate of delamination growth much better than those based on the total strain energy release rate.",

Delaminations are modeled using a cohesive type tie-break interface introduced between sublaminates while intralaminar damage mechanisms within the sublaminates are captured in a smeared manner using a strain-softening plastic-damage model. In the latter case, a nonlocal regularization scheme is used to address the spurious mesh dependency and mesh-orientation problems that occur with all local strain-softening type constitutive models. The results for the predicted damage patterns using the nonlocal approach are encouraging and qualita- tively agree with the experimental observations. The predictive performance of the pro- posed numerical model is assessed through comparisons with available instrumented impact test results on a class of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates. Force-time histories and other derived cross-plots such as the force versus projectile displacement and progression of projectile energy loss as a function of time are compared with available experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the model in capturing the details of the dynamic response. Another case study involving the blast loading of CFRP composite laminates is used to further highlight the capability of the proposed model in simulating the global structural response of composite laminates subjected to distributed pressure pulses.",

Our experiments were performed on bend-test bars that were loaded either in &#039;supported&#039; four-point bending or under &#039;unsupported&#039; conditions with a Hopkinson pressure bar to induce dynamic loading. We found differences in the damage that occurred in specimens loaded by the two techniques, in terms of the number of cracks and the length of the cracks. In the case of quasi-static loading, there were many matrix cracks within individual plies and only a few delamination cracks between plies; the maximum ratio of numbers of matrix to delamination cracks observed was 6:1. Despite their small number, the delamination cracks had a greater total length than the matrix cracks, and specimen failure occurred as a result of delamination crack propagation. During dynamic loading, the ratio between numbers of matrix and delamination cracks was 3:1, and in this case the ratio between the total crack lengths was unity. A quantitative assessment of damage induced during quasi-static bending was made from specimen stiffness results. Using simple beam theory and knowing the location of the damage, we correlated beam stiffness to the materials effective elastic modulus. We found that the composite&#039;s effective modulus decreased rapidly with small amounts of initial damage, but that subsequent increases in damage decreased the effective modulus at a much lower rate.",

In order to simplify the numerical analysis, an interfacial layer was embedded in between the composite laminae. A penny-shape delamination was introduced at the center of the composite laminates and was assumed to have very low modulus to avoid the penetration between delaminated surfaces due to central loading. Based on the three-dimensional finite element analysis, the strain energy release rates at the delamination front were calculated. Because the interlaminar normal stresses were negative in the interfaces, there was no mode I failure in central loading. Numerical results also revealed that GII was higher than GIII in most cases examined. In addition, GII in the fiber direction of the composite lamina beneath the interfacial layer was significantly higher than that in the matrix direction. This result indicated the nature of non-self-similar delamination initiation which was believed to result in the anisotropic delamination in the composite laminates subjected to central loading.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, the correlation between interlaminar fracture toughness and impact energy absorption for the fracture of epoxy-carbon laminates was studied. Carbon fibres-epoxy cross-ply prepreg layers were interleaved with thin (26 ??m) poly(ethylene-terephthalate) (PET) films. Before the composite preparation, circular holes 1 mm in diameter were drilled in the PET films at several densities (from 0 up to 44 holes/cm2) in order to selectively increase the interlaminar contact area between the epoxy-carbon laminae. In this way, the interlaminar contact area was gradually varied from 0%, corresponding to the case in which non-perforated PET films were used, up to 100% in the case of non-interleaved laminates. The Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the resulting laminates was determined according to the ASTM D-5528-01 standard test method on double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. The critical values of the strain energy release rate determined at the point at which the load versus opening displacement curve becomes non-linear (GIC,NL) resulted to vary from 40 up to 260 J/m2, depending on the interlaminar contact area. All the laminates were then characterized by three point bending tests performed both under quasi-static (5 mm/min) and impact (2 m/s) loading conditions. The elastic modulus of the laminates resulted to be practically independent of the level of interlaminar adhesion, while the bending strength decreased as the interlaminar fracture toughness decreased. The total energy to fracture evaluated under impact conditions showed a non-monotonic correlation with the interlaminar fracture toughness, reaching a maximum level in correspondence of a GIC,NL value of about 60 J/m2. At the same time, the ductility index, i.e. the ratio between the propagation and the initiation energies, evaluated by instrumented Charpy impact tests, markedly increased as the interlaminar fracture toughness decreased. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Impact fracture tests were performed by the WIF (wedge-insert-fracture) method with a SHPB (split Hopkinson pressure bar) system for accurate measurement of impact fracture toughness, while quasi-static fracture tests were performed by the DCB (double-cantilever-beam) method with a screw-driven testing machine. In the present composite laminates, the fracture toughness decreased stepwise with increasing loading rate showing a distinct rate-sensitive transition region and two rate-insensitive regions above and below. As a consequence of this stepwise characteristic, the crack growth behaviour varied with loading rate: in and below this transition region, the crack grew unstably accompanied by high-speed propagation and arrest; but above the transition region, the crack grew stably and continuously. This trend was well explained by a simple model incorporating the rate dependence of fracture toughness and the contribution of kinetic energy in the specimen during unstable crack propagation.",

Two manufacturing processes, the autoclave process and the fast heating rated Quickstep process, were employed to cure this material. The Quickstep process is a unique composite production technology which utilizes the fast heat transfer rate of fluid to heat and cure polymer composite components. The manufacturing influence on the mode I delamination fracture toughness of laminates was investigated by performing double cantilever beam tests. The composite specimens fabricated by two processes exhibited dissimilar delamination resistance curves (R-curves) under mode I loading. The initial value of fracture toughness GIC-INIT was 564J/m2 for the autoclave specimens and 527J/m2 for the Quickstep specimens. However, the average propagation fracture toughness GIC-PROP was 783J/m2 for the Quickstep specimens, which was 2.6 times of that for the autoclave specimens. The mechanism of fracture occurred during delamination was studied under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three types of fracture were observed: the interlayer fracture, the interface fracture, and the intralaminar fracture. These three types of fracture played different roles in affecting the delamination resistance curves during the crack growth. More fiber bridging was found in the process of delamination for the Quickstep specimens. Better fiber/matrix adhesion was found in the Quickstep specimens by conducting indentation-debond tests.",

          "abstract": "This study is aimed at comparing the response of TS-based (epoxy) and TP-based (PPS or PEEK) laminates subjected to low velocity impacts. C-scan inspections showed that impact led to diamond-shaped damage resulting from different failure mechanisms: fiber breakages in warp and weft directions, more or less inter-laminar and intra-ply damage, and extensive delamination in C/PEEK and C/epoxy laminates. The permanent indentation can be ascribed to specific mechanisms which mainly depend on many factors including the ultimate out-of-plane shear strength, and the interlaminar fracture toughness in modes I-II-III. In TP-based laminates, the matrix plasticization seems to play an important role in matrix-rich areas by locally promoting permanent deformations. Fiber-bridging also prevents the plies from opening in mode I, and slows down the propagation of interlaminar and intralaminar cracks in modes II-III. Both mechanisms seem to reduce the extension of damages, in particular, the subsequent delamination for a given impact energy. In epoxy-based laminates, the debris of broken fibers and matrix get stuck in the cracks and the adjacent layers, and create a sort of blocking system that prevents the cracks and delamination from closing after impact. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

However, one of the difficulties associated with such a study is the change in overall elastic parameters occurring when modifying local ply orientations. The present work uses laminates with special stacking sequences allowing for isolating the orientation parameter. Multidirectional DCB specimens were designed so as to obtain an uncoupled quasi isotropic and quasi-homogeneous elastic behavior, with the same properties for the entire laminate and the two sub laminates separated by the pre crack at mid-plane. The results show that the toughness in term of GIC is slightly affected by the variation of ply orientations at the crack interface. The differences are more pronounced in the crack propagation behavior after the initiation point. Even with the same orientation at the crack interface, different subsequent ply orientations can also lead to different crack resistance behavior. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Delamination was known to be one of the most important damage modes in composite laminates subjected to impact loading. In an effort to further understand the impact response of composite laminates, various degrees of impact ranging from subperforation to perforation were introduced to glass/epoxy laminates through an instrumented drop-weight impactor. In addition, composite laminates of various in-plane dimensions and thicknesses were examined for in-plane dimensional and thickness effects, respectively. Experimental results showed that in-plane dimensional effect was not as significant as thickness effect. The impacted composite laminates were then subjected to compression after impact (CAI) tests for characterizations of residual mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that perforation was the most important damage stage in composite laminates subjected to impact loading since impact characteristics (peak force, contact duration and absorbed energy) and mechanical properties degradation (residual compressive maximum force and residual compressive absorbed energy) of composite laminates became stable once perforation took place. However, it was also found that delamination played a very important role in the characterizations of mechanical properties degradation. Since the impact response of composite laminates is due to plate bending to some extent, bending analysis was used to explain the greater influence of thickness effect to in-plane dimensional effect. It was also found that bending analysis was feasible for interpretation of delamination in mechanical properties degradation.",

The analysis adopts a first-order shear deformable layer-wise kinematics for the laminate and an interface model simulating mixed-mode fracture in the presence of a bridged delamination. A penalised interface simulates adhesion between layers and provides energy release rates through its strain energy density while a two-parameter softening interface with a limit displacement models bridging stresses. Delamination evolution analysis is performed by solving the non-linear boundary value problem resulting from a stress analysis coupled with opportune propagation conditions. Numerical examples are presented for composite laminates subjected to both pure mode and mixed-mode loading conditions and the results are compared with those obtained adopting classic delamination models. Analytical formulae for energy release rate evaluation are also proposed to carry out an investigation of the main factors governing accuracy in predicting delamination growth. The proposed approach captures important effects which are not included in classic delamination models.

Design/miethodology/approach - This involves experimental investigation of FRP composites with woven roving fibers and matrix. Different types of composites, i.e. glass: epoxy, glass: polyester and (carbon + glass): epoxy are used in the investigation with change in percentage of constituents. The variability of fiber content of the composite is in the range of 0.55-0.65 weight fractions. The matrix dominated property, like inter laminar shear strength (ILSS) has been studied by three point bend test using INSTRON 1195 material testing machine with increasing five cross head velocities. Findings - The variation of ILSS of laminates of FRP composites is significant for low loading speed and is not so prominent for high speed. The variation of ILSS are observed to be dependent on the type and amount of constituents present in the composites. The laminates with carbon fiber shows higher ILSS than that of glass fiber composites. The laminates with epoxy matrix shows higher ILSS than polyester matrix composites for the same fiber. There is no significant variation of ILSS beyond loading speed 200 mm/min and this can be used for specifications of testing. Matrix resins such as polyester and epoxy are known to be highly rate sensitive. Carbon fiber are relatively rate independent and E-glass fibers are rate sensitive. Woven roving carbon glass fiber reinforced polymer shows small rate dependence and woven roving glass fiber reinforced polymer shows significant rate sensitivity. Originality/value - The findings are based on original experimental investigations in the laboratories of the institute and can be used for characterization of composites.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a numerical simulation of interlaminar damage propagation in FRP laminates under transverse loading, using the finite element method. First, we conducted drop-weight impact tests on CFRP cross-ply laminates. A ply crack was generated at the center of the lowermost ply, and then a butterfly-shaped interlaminar delamination was propagated at the 90/0 ply interface. Based on these experimental observations, we present a numerical simulation of interlaminar damage propagation, using a cohesive zone model to address the energy-based criterion for damage propagation. This simulation can address the interlaminar delamination with high accuracy by locating a fine mesh near the damage process zone, while maintaining computational efficiency with the use of automatic mesh generation. The simulated results of interlaminar delamination agreed well with the experiment results. Moreover, we demonstrated that the proposed method reduces the computational cost of the simulation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A classical interface damage evolution law, which is commonly used to predict the static debonding process, is modified further to incorporate fatigue delamination effects due to high cycle loadings. An improved formulation is also presented to incorporate the &#039;R&#039; ratio effects. The proposed fatigue damage model is identified using fracture mechanics tests like double cantilever beam, end-notched-flexure and mixed-mode bending. Then a non-monotonic behavior is used to predict the fatigue damage parameters able to carry out delamination simulations for different mode mixtures. Linear Paris plot behaviors of the above-mentioned fracture mechanics tests are successfully compared with available experimental data on HTA/6376C and AS4/PEEK unidirectional materials. © The Author(s), 2010.",

This damage can result in gouges or damage resembling deep scratches that can impact one or more plies. In this study, the effects of scratch geometry on the delamination of a laminated composite under tensile loading are investigated using experimental and numerical analysis techniques. A numerical approach based cohesive zone models is used to simulate the progressive failure of the composite specimen containing scratches. Scratches at different depths in carbon fiber-epoxy laminates are modeled to study the influence of the scratch tip and its interaction with the stacking sequence. Experimental results show the interlaminar crack propagation has good correlation with the proposed modeling approach for initiation and propagation load levels. These deformation modes are validated with a full-field digital image correlation assessment. The results indicate that the scratch tip location within the stacking sequence is a dominant factor for tension load capacity associated with the scratch depth and geometry and can result in undesirable bending and torsional deformations, further driving the delamination response. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This diminishes the resistance of the structure to failure. In this paper, matrix cracking and delamination propagation in composite laminates are simulated as a part of damage. Two different computational strategies are developed: (i) a cohesive model (CM) based on the classical continuum mechanics and (ii) a continuous damage material model (CDM) coupling failure modes and damage. Another mixed methodology (MM) is proposed using the continuous damage model for delamination initiation and the cohesive model for 3D crack propagation and mesh openings.

A 2-D shear lag method is used to determine stresses in a laminate representative segment containing one crack and two crack tip delaminations. For the calculation of the strain-energy release rate (SERR) associated with delaminations, the damaged layer is replaced with an equivalent homogeneous one with effective elastic properties. Closed-form expressions for the total SERR and its mode I and mode II components as a linear function of the first partial derivatives of the effective elastic properties of the damaged layer with respect to delamination area are derived. Dependence of SERRs and the laminate stiffness properties on delamination area, crack density and ply orientation angle is examined for balanced [O2/??2/-??2]5 and unbalanced [O2/??2]5 carbon/ epoxy laminates. The total SERR obtained in this study is compared to a simple closed-form expression for a uniform local delamination derived in earlier work by O&#039;Brien (Local delamination in laminates with angle-ply matrix cracks: Part II Delamination Fracture Analysis and Fatigue Characterization. NASA Technical Memorandum 104076/AVS-COM Technical Report 91-B-011). It appears that matrix crack density and delamination size influence the SERR value significantly. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Since laminate structures are applied to the load support system for superconducting magnets, the evaluation of interlaminar strength both under static and fatigue loadings is essential from the view point of structural integrity. In the present study, mode I and II interlaminar fracture toughness and delamination fatigue crack growth behavior were investigated with unidirectional ALF/epoxy laminates using double cantilever beam specimens and end notched flexure specimens both with a special loading device. The fracture toughness values and the fatigue crack growth resistance of ALF/epoxy laminates were higher than those of CF/epoxy laminates with similar matrices. The analysis of the stress-ratio dependency showed that the contribution of the maximum stress was higher for ALF/epoxy than that for CF/epoxy laminates. The fractographic observation indicated that the interfacial fracture was dominant on the fracture surfaces of fatigue fracture, suggesting that the microscopic mechanism was different from that of CF/epoxy laminates.",

Interlaminar shear stress was evaluated to assess the delamination tolerance on both virgin (preexposed) and harsh environment-exposed composites specimens. Delamination tests were performed with the pattern of four-point bending and tensile and compression shear tests under different combinations of humidity and temperature exposure, ranging from zero to 32 weeks. During the tests, the stress at the onset of delamination was taken as the first deviation of the load-displacement curve. Experimental study revealed that the delamination load-carrying capability reduced to 40% with the exposure time. Throughout the aging process dimensional stability was almost unchanged; however, 1.29% moisture absorption was noticeable in laminated composites. Microstructures of the delaminated surface revealed that failure occurs suddenly in a macroscopically fragile mode by crack initiation and proliferation. The delamination mechanism involved interlaminar processing flaws that favored the initiation and propagation of the interlaminar cracks, which are responsible for the delamination of the composite. As load carrying capacity dwindles substantially, therefore the effect of temperature and moisture must be taken into account in the experimental characterization of the laminates when establishing a design limit for composite structure.",

The assumption of lamina homogeneity is questionable when predicting failure, though it is suitable for stress analysis. Matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination are inherent to the inhomogeneous nature of the composite, thus the assumption of material homogeneity taints the failure prediction. It is, therefore, essential that the inhomogeneous nature of the composites must be retained in the analysis in order to predict the correct failure modes. Hence, this study considers distinct properties of the fiber and matrix and their volume fractions and fiber orientations while modeling composite laminates. The peridynamic theory is employed to predict the damage in center-cracked laminates with different fiber orientations. The predictions from the peridynamic analysis agree with the experimental observations published in the literature. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The methodology uses post-process criteria, based on fracture mechanics linked with damage mechanics, of computational code by the effective stress tensor. ??? In the second place, the influence of delamination over the overall behaviour of the structure is taken into account. This influence is introduced by locally changing material characterization, quite progressively during the loading phase. These integrated effects change the numerical behaviour on loading and energy curves. The validation is carried out with experimental low velocity impact tests on the bending tests. A satisfactory coherence is shown for damage mechanisms and delamination shapes, in different examples. The methodology developed is recognized a predictive process for several laminates under study.

An examination of the failed FMLs highlighted the presence of delamination between the titanium alloy and the fiber-reinforced composite.

          "abstract": "This paper deals with the thermoelastic effects on mixed-mode delamination growth behaviour emanating from circular holes in laminated Fiber-Reinforced Polymeric (FRP) composites. Two sets of full three-dimensional analyses have been performed (one with the thermal residual stresses developed while curing the laminate and the other without thermal residual stresses i.e., with mechanical loading only) to calculate the displacements and interlaminar stresses along the annular shaped delaminated interface responsible for delamination onset and propagation. Modified Crack Closure Integral (MCCI) method based on the concept of linear elastic fracture mechanics has been followed to calculate the three modes of Strain Energy Release Rates (SERR). The strain energy release rate components GI, GII and GIII along the annular shaped delamination front due to thermal residual stresses developed while curing the laminate (i.e., cooling from an elevated temperature of thermosetting to the room temperature) and the subsequent mechanical loading have been obtained by superimposing their respective effects. Numerical calculations are carried out for multi-layered cross-ply and angle-ply glass/epoxy FRP composite laminates and the strain energy release rate plots demonstrate large asymmetries along the delamination front due to the interaction of residual curing stresses and superimposed mechanical loading. It is observed that the residual curing stresses have the effect of enhancing the behaviour of delamination growth. On subsequent mechanical loading this can be a potential source of causing premature failure due to the superimposed thermomechanical effects. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Fiber breakage, delaminations, matrix cracking, plastic deformations due to contact and large displacements are some effects which should be considered when a structure made from composite material is impacted by a foreign object. Thus, an investigation of the low velocity impact on laminated composite thin disks of epoxy resin reinforced by carbon fiber is presented. The influence of stacking sequence and energy impact was investigated using load-time histories, displacement-time histories and energy-time histories as well as images from NDE. Indentation tests results were compared to dynamic results, verifying the inertia effects when thin composite laminate was impacted by foreign object with low velocity.

The delamination fatigue crack growth resistance of the T800H/3900-2 laminates was about 3 times higher than that of the reference CFRP for Stage I. This ratio decreased to 1.5 times for Stage II. For UT500/111/ionomer laminates, the high level of the fatigue crack growth resistance was kept without respect to the crack length. The threshold value of UT500/111/ionomer laminates was about 3 times higher than base UT500/111 laminates.

          "abstract": "Three-dimensional finite element modeling was used to analyze the delamination between the stiffener flange and the skin of a typical pull-off specimen representing a section of a stiffened skin panel. The finite element analysis results were used to calculate the total strain energy release rate and its Mode I, Mode II, and Mode III components along the delamination front through the width of the pull-off specimen. Three-dimensional modeling makes it possible to represent ply-by-ply lamina properties in the model. However, the ply-by-ply approach should not be used for highly angle ply laminates because of the strong transverse effect from adjacent plies. A smeared properties approach is more robust for the strain energy release rate analysis of delamination between ±45-degree angle ply laminates. The three-dimensional analysis indicates that delamination failure between the stiffener flange and the skin is dominated by Mode I and Mode II delamination modes. The three-dimensional analysis predicts delamination growth from the interior of the pull-off specimen width, and higher pull-off load is required to grow the delamination close to the free edges. The delamination initiation load along the interior of the pull-off specimen width does not change with the change of the width of the pull-off specimen. However, the wider specimen has stronger free edge effects than the narrower specimen. The lay-up of the skin and the flange can have significant effect on the delamination initiation load. Stiffening the skin and maintaining the compliant flange will increase the delamination initiation load.",

In C laminates, a fatigue crack propagated along the interface of the unidirectional tape at positive stress-ratios, while along the interface of the satin-woven fabric at negative stress-ratios. When the stress-ratio was negative, the fracture surface of C laminates was rough because of the resin rich area of fabric intersection, and this roughness gave rise to the constraint of the plastic deformation near the crack tip. Thus the crack growth resistance of C laminates at negative stress-ratios was much higher than that at positive stress-ratios. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

However, problems in drilling, particularly the heterogeneity and anisotropy of composite materials, increase delamination. Several studies have proved that delamination is related to the thrust force in drilling composite materials. The thrust force of step-core drill with drilling parameters (diameter ratio, feed rate and spindle speed) in drilling carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates were experimentally investigated in this study. The results indicate that diameter ratio and feed rate have the most significant influence on the overall performance of step-core drills and step-core-saw drill produces the highest drilling thrust force. The advantages of the step-core drill design are that the thrust force exerted is distributed toward the drill periphery in drilling. The diameter ratio may be a viable alternative for the step-core drill in terms of drilling thrust. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The form of the spectrum changed sensitively depending on the delamination size. Furthermore, the spectra were calculated theoretically for confirmation of the measured spectra. Since the change in the measured spectrum was consistent with that in the calculated spectrum, the relationship between the delamination size and the form of the spectrum could be clarified.

          "abstract": "Fiber reinforced composites have been widely used in aerospace applications due to their functional properties, such as high strength-to-weight ratios. But many challenges remain to be overcome in order to permit more confidence in the performance of composite structures. In particular, composites have different failure types and modes that make damage prediction and propagation a very challenging subject. The main two damage types are matrix micro-cracking and delamination. Matrix micro-cracking develops first, causing delamination. The detection and quantification of matrix micro-cracks would provide the needed information to predict the development of delamination and the correct safety or maintenance decision to be made. The challenge in matrix micro-cracking identification is that it is a distributed damage, while delamination is a localized damage. The state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques are good at detecting and localizing major changes in sensor signals, which usually points to delamination, holes or other localized defects. Furthermore, there are a limited number of features that can be extracted from sensor signals, and most of them are affected by both delamination and matrix micro-cracking. The work presented in this paper aims at finding which features are more sensitive to each damage type (delamination or matrix micro-cracks), and applying machine learning techniques to learn and model a classifier that uses these features efficiently to classify the detected damage.",

Th einfluence of interlaminar reinforcement with chopped Kevlar fibres on toughness has also been examined. The quasi-static or low-speed delamination tests were conducted with the usual double contilever beam, end-notched flexure and mixed-mode flexure specimen. To determine the corresponding mode I, mode II and mixed-mode toughnesses under the impact condition, a special specimen design has been adopted and tests were performed with a Charpy impact machine. The novel aspect of the test scheme in the present study is that a single-plane delamination surface with a well-defined fracture mode has been obtained. The dynamic and static delamination characteristics of the same fracture mode were then studied by scanning electron microscopy, and special features were compared. While iterlaminar reinforsment with a small amount of chopped Kevlar fibres resulted in a appreciable increase in the quasi-static delamination toughness. It was less effective under the ompact condition.",

Currently Mode-I interlaminar fracture toughness or critical energy release rate of a composite is measured using double cantilever beam (DCB) with unidirectional composites (ASTM D5528). Unlike metals, the energy plot of a DCB specimen shows increase in energy release rate with increase in crack length. Also during testing the steady state energy release rate from each of the samples of the same batch shows a lot of variation due to fiber cross-over bridging that occurs only in unidirectional composites. In this study, a probabilistic Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) is developed to capture steady state energy release rate variations of 51. mm crack size DCB specimens based on unidirectional composite (IM7/977-3) test data. Then using the probabilistic CZM, the energy release rate variations of 76.2. mm crack size DCB model are predicted and compared to the test results. The predictions showed good agreement with the experiments suggesting a probabilistic CZM is capable of simulating the delamination process in unidirectional composites. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Surface free energy has been often treated as a scalar constant without considering its dependence on propagation direction. It is desirable, however, to investigate how surface free energy or fracture toughness of delamination in a single interface varies with both the local mismatch angle of fiber directions and the direction of crack propagation in polymeric laminate composites. As a materials constant, fracture toughness is effectively used for various mechanical analyses of fiber-reinforced composites as well as conventional materials. This study investigates quantitatively and qualitatively the dependence of delamination fracture toughness on mismatch angle and crack propagation direction in laminated structures. AS4-Carbon/Epoxy prepregs were used for fabricating test specimens, and 50 different mismatch angles of fiber direction were applied on the delaminated interface of laminates. Fracture toughness was measured using the Mixed-mode Bending (MMB) test. This test method is composed of fracture mode-I and mode- II, and the mixed-mode ratio (GII/G) can be controlled. The mixed-mode ratios used here were 20, 35, 50, 65, and 80%. The crack path and the delamination fracture toughness were observed and calculated for specimens, and the dependence of the toughness was shown to be related to the mismatch angle of ply fibers at the delaminated interface. The relationship between mismatch angle and delamination fracture toughness was newly revealed and discussed for various angles. These results can be usefully applied to various fracture mechanics analyses in fiber-reinforced laminated composites. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

This paper reviews the current damage mechanics and fracture methods for predicting delamination under impact available in the literature. Many damage mechanics models are available, some providing good delamination predictions. The linear elastic fracture mechanics method has been used extensively where the shape of the delamination front can be predicted and a suitably shaped mesh can be provided. However, as impact events produce irregular shaped delamination fronts, this method requires an adaptive mesh approach that is not yet available in any of the major analysis codes. The cohesive fracture model solves some of the limitation of the linear elastic fracture mechanics method, however a definitive study of its abilities has yet to be found in the literature. The delamination threshold load method is an extremely simple method and provides surprisingly good results. The review concludes that additional development of current techniques is required before a definitive predictive delamination method will be available. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "A numerical model for simulating the process of low-velocity impact damage in composite laminates using the finite element method is presented in this paper, i.e. Part I of this two part series on the study of impact. In this model, the 9-node Lagrangian element of the Mindlin plate with consideration of large deformation analysis is employed. To analyze the transient response of the laminated plates, a modified Newmark time integration algorithm previously proposed by the authors is adopted here. We also proved that the impact process between a rigid ball and laminated plates is a stiff system, therefore a kind of A(α) stable method has been advocated here to solve the motion equation of the rigid ball. Furthermore, various types of damages including delamination, matrix cracking and fiber breakage, etc. and their mutual influences are modeled and investigated in detail. To overcome the difficulty of numerical oscillation or instability in the analysis of the dynamic contact problem between delaminated layers using the traditional penalty methods, we have employed dynamic spring constraints to simulate the contact effect, which are added to the numerical model by a kind of continuous penalty function. Moreover, an effective technique to calculate the strain energy release rate based on the Mindlin plate model is proposed, which can attain high precision. Finally, some techniques of adaptive analyses have been realized for improving the computational efficiency. Based on this model, a program has been developed for numerically simulating the damage process of cross-ply fiber-reinforced carbon/epoxy composite laminates under low-velocity impact load. In Part II, this numerical model will be verified by comparing with the experimental results. Also the impact damage will be investigated in detail using this numerical approach. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In terms of energythe TTR fiber pull-out can be accompanied bysignificant amount of energydissipation due to the frictional work at interface; this process absorbs part of the energythat would otherwise be placed at the delamination front of the structure. The basic objective of this research project was to develop an efficient and accurate finite-element-based numerical tool to simulate the spontaneous propagation of a single TTR pull-out under quasi-static conditions and in the presence of frictional contact between the fiber/ matrix interface. The pull-out phenomenon was studied assuming a constant friction coefficient at the interface along the TTR axial direction and using improved contact-elements to solve the frictional contact problem. Load/displacement bridging curves of the fiber pull-out process, which includes elastic deformation with a fully/partially bonded interface plus frictional sliding, were calculated. Moreover, the effect of friction model was also investigated. Numerical results were validated byexperimental observations of debonding and frictional sliding of a fiber in steady-state pull-out tests under pure Mode I loading conditions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation conducted to study the impact effects on concrete beams strengthened with fiber- reinforced polymer laminates. Two types of composite laminates, carbon and Kevlar, were bonded to the top and bottom faces of concrete beams with epoxy. Five beams were tested: two strengthened with Kevlar laminates, two strengthened with carbon laminates, and one unretrofitted beam as the control specimen. The impact load was applied by dropping a steel cylinder from a specified height onto the top face of the beam. The test results revealed that composite laminates significantly increased the capacity of the concrete beams to resist impact load. In addition, the laminates reduced the deflection and crack width. Comparing the test results of the beams strengthened with Kevlar and carbon laminates indicated that the gain in strength depends on the type, thickness, weight, and material properties of the composite laminate.",

The strength behavior of FRP and FML under in-plane load and out-of-plane load is compared based on the optimization results.

An alternative method, based on variation of the excessive energy (Ee) versus impact energy (Ei), is presented to determine penetration threshold (Pn). The penetration threshold for stacking sequence [0/90/+45/−45]s is found to be smaller than that of [0/90/0/90]s. The primary damage mode was found to be fiber fracture for higher impact energies; whereas, it was indentation resulting in delamination and matrix cracks for smaller impact energies.

This mixed-mode bending (MMB) test was analyzed using both finite-element procedures and beam theory to calculate the mode I and mode II components of strain-energy release rate GI and GII, respectively. A wide range of GI/GII ratios can be produced by varying the load position on the lever. As the delamination extended, the GI/GII ratios varied by less than 5%. Beam theory equations agreed closely with the finite-element results and provide a basis for selection of GI/GII test ratios and a basis for computing the mode I and mode II components of measured delamination toughness. The MMB test was demonstrated using AS4/PEEK(APC2) unidirectional laminates. The MMB test introduced in this paper is rather simple and is believed to offer several advantages over most current mixed-mode test.",

Different types of multiple delaminations are considered and their effects upon buckling behavior are examined. The nonlinear buckling analysis uses a finite element method, including contact elements to prevent the overlapping situation, to predict the buckling stress and the corresponding buckling mode. The results indicate that as the length of the beneath delaminations is not larger than the length of the near-surface delamination, the beneath delaminations have no significant effects on the buckling stress, such that the buckling behaviors of multiple delaminations are almost the same as those of single delamination. When a short delamination appears above the long delamination, three types of multiple delaminations are investigated. If the length of the short delamination is greater than one critical value, the short delamination above the long delamination will reduce the buckling stress and change the buckling mode. When the short delamination approaches the same length as the long delamination, the buckling stress becomes the value of the single delamination case. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The contact phenomenon is different in small and large indentation stages. which is due to occurrence of laminate damage. The contact force corresponding to the onset of laminate damage is found to be independent of the indentor size. In the small indentation stage where the plate is intact. the change of laminate stacking sequence has an insignificant effect on the force-indentation relationship. However. the force-indentor size relationship does not follow the modified contact law for thin laminates indented by large indentors. Beyond the small indentation stage, damage occurs. The size of the delamination area is proportional to the applied loads and the number of repeated loading cycles. The passage of the delamination crack front can be detected using strain gauges. Also. the indentation spring becomes stiffer under repeated loading. Finally, the delamination damage and the strain history in a laminate at lowvelocity impact are found to be very similar to those in the contact test except that vibration was observed in the impact test.",

By means of finite element approach, the laminae stiffnesses are constructed independently from their interface, where a well-defined virtually zero-thickness interface element is discreetly adopted for delamination simulation. The present model has the advantage of simulating a localized interfacial condition at arbitrary locations, for various degeneration areas and intensities, under the influence of numerous boundary conditions since the interfacial description is expressed discretely. In comparison, the model shows good agreement with existing results from the literature when modeled in a perfectly bonded state. It is found that as the local delamination area increases, so does the magnitude of the maximum displacement history. Also, as top and bottom fiber orientations deviation increases, both central deflection and energy absorption increase although the relative maximum displacement correspondingly decreases when in contrast to the laminates perfectly bonded state.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed numerical study of the mode I interlaminar fracture of carbon/epoxy composite laminates with z-fibre reinforcement. The study was performed using a double cantilever beam configuration. A finite element model was developed using thick-layered shell elements to model the composite laminates and non-linear interface elements to simulate the through thickness reinforcements. An existing micro-mechanical solution was employed to model the material behaviour of the interface element. The numerical analysis showed that z-fibre pinning were effective in bridging delamination when damage had propagated into the z-fibre field; these pins provided crack closure forces that shielded the delamination crack from the full delaminating force and moment due to applied loads. Therefore, the z-fibre technique significantly improves the crack growth resistance and hence arrests or delays delamination extension. The numerical results were validated against experimental data. With reference to structural integrity this technique can be used to design a more damage tolerant structure. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Here, pyramidal truss sandwich cores with relative densities ρ¯ in the range 1–10% have been manufactured from carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates by employing a snap-fitting method. The measured quasi-static shear strength varied between 0.8 and 7.5MPa. Two failure modes were observed: (i) Euler buckling of the struts and (ii) delamination failure of the laminates. Micro-buckling failure of the struts was not observed in the experiments reported here while Euler buckling and delamination failures occurred for the low (ρ¯⩽1%) and high (ρ¯&gt;1%) relative density cores, respectively. Analytical models for the collapse of the composite cores by these failure modes are presented. Good agreement between the measurements and predictions based on the Euler buckling and delamination failure of the struts is observed while the micro-buckling analysis over-predicts the measurements. The CFRP pyramidal cores investigated here have a similar mechanical performance to CFRP honeycombs. Thus, for a range of multi-functional applications that require an “open-celled” architecture (e.g. so that cooling fluid can pass through a sandwich core), the CFRP pyramidal cores offer an attractive alternative to honeycombs.",

The finite element analysis indicates that the Gl component (opening mode delamination) is reduced to zero for delamination length greater than one ply thickness; the shear mode (Mode II) dominates the growth of delamination. The total GT increases with increasing delamination length, but eventually approaches a constant asymptotic value, which is close to the GT result calculated from the analytical model. Finally, the analytical and numerical calculations show that G for local delamination decreases notably with increasing matrix cracking.",

It was observed that the delamination growth occurs mainly in transverse direction to the load and that buckles on the backside usually have the same shape as some of the delaminations. This indicates that the buckling which takes place during the compressive part of the load cycle drives delamination growth.

The growth rate of cyclic delamination between the aluminium sheets and the fibre/epoxy composite core could be related to the effective strain energy release rate (Gmax -Gth) by a Paris type equation, dD/dN = c(Gmax - Gth)m, where c and m are fitting constants. The threshold energy release rate Gth could be separated into two terms, G0th and Gr. It was shown that Gr could be related to the strain energy release rate solely due to thermal residual stresses in the laminate, while G0th might represent a parameter related to the intrinsic interfacial characteristics. Interestingly, the three constants c, m and G0th were found to be independent of the volume fraction of carbon/epoxy and the magnitude of thermal residual stress. Therefore, once the constants c, m and G0th were determined, the fatigue delamination growth in the hybrid laminate with various carbon/epoxy contents and/or thermal residual stresses could be predicted readily by this empirical equation.",

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0°/90°] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies. Predictions of residual velocity, development of deformation and delamination correlate well with experimental results.",

          "abstract": "The role of mesh design in the post-buckling analysis of delamination in composite laminates is addressed in this paper. The determination of the strain energy release rate (SERR) along the crack front is central to the analysis. Frequently, theoretical analysis is limited to treatment of the problem in two dimensions, since considerable complexity is encountered in extending the analysis to three dimensions. However, many practical problems of embedded delamination in composite laminates are inherently three-dimensional in nature. Although in such cases, the finite element (FE) method can be employed, there are some issues that must be examined more closely to ensure physically realistic models. One of these issues is the effect of mesh design on the determination of the local SERR along the delamination front. There are few studies that deal with this aspect systematically. In this paper, the effect of mesh design in the calculation of SERR in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) FE analyses of the post-buckling behavior of embedded delaminations is studied and some guidelines on mesh design are suggested. Two methods of calculation of the SERR are considered: The virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) and crack closure technique (CCT). The 2D analyses confirm that if the near-tip mesh is symmetric and consists of square elements, then the evaluation of the SERR is not sensitive to mesh refinement, and a reasonably coarse mesh is adequate. Despite agreement in the global post-buckling response of the delaminated part, the SERR calculated using different unsymmetrical near-tip meshes could be different. Therefore, unsymmetrical near-tip meshes should be avoided, as convergence of the SERR with mesh refinement could not be assured. While the results using VCCT and CCT for 2D analyses agree well with each other, these techniques yield different quantitative results when applied to 3D analyses. The reason may be due to the way in which the delamination growth is modeled. The CCT allows simultaneous delamination advance over finite circumferential lengths, but it is very difficult to implement and the results exhibit mesh dependency. Qualitatively, however, the two sets of results show similar distributions of Mode I and Mode II components of the SERR. This is fortunate, since the VCCT is relatively easy to implement.

Uniaxial tension behaviors of KBFBs and KBFB-reinforced epoxy strands were evaluated statistically using large sample sets. The elastic modulus, tensile strength, as well as failure strains of KBFBs, displayed large scatter statistically ranging from 10% to 30%. The loading rate-dependency was evaluated at three strain rates ranging from approximately 10-4 ??? 10-2/s. The tensile strength increases gradually as the loading rate increases, while the tensile modulus almost remains the same as the loading rate increases until the loading rate reaches 10-2/s, at which a much higher modulus was presented. The high temperatures (170-180 ??C), possibly subjected during fiber processing and composite fabrication, do not impose significant effects on the tensile properties of KBFBs if the duration is less than 1-h. The tensile properties of KBFB were not affected by the conditioning at 130 ??C for 24-h, which mimics the severe service temperature of automotive front-end components. KBFB-epoxy composite strands were further evaluated at various loading rates.

Double-cantilever beam (DCB) tests were conducted to measure the interfacial fracture energy, and an increase in interfacial fracture toughness by up to six times was achieved by using the latter method. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the failure behavior and fracture mechanisms of the CFRMLs. No clear differences were found in laminate mechanical properties such as tensile strength and Young’s modulus. A reduction of 10% in the relative value for the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was observed for the laminate with poor interfacial adhesion associated with the P2-Etch method, in both three- and five-point bend tests. However, the residual strength of the notched CFRMLs is, in general, almost independent of the adhesion status between aluminum sheets and composite prepreg, although a slight increase in residual strength for laminates with weak interfacial adhesion was observed in the presence of small holes, because of the difference in delamination growth.",

The reflection spectra from the FBG sensor were measured at various delamination lengths through four-point bending test. The form of the spectrum changed sensitively, as the delamination length increased. Moreover, the spectrum was calculated theoretically for confirmation of the measured spectrum.

          "abstract": "Abstract  Due to the inherent anisotropy and inhomogeneous nature of polymer-based composite materials, their cutting mechanism differs in many respects from conventional metallic materials. Amongst all machining operations, drilling using a twist drill is the most commonly applied method for generating holes for riveting and fastening structural assemblies. Most of the previous research correlates the drill geometry and feed rate to thrust force and delamination on the performance of a twist drill. The Taguchi method has been used to solve many engineering problems. In this investigation, drilling-induced thrust force and delamination by core-saw drill during drilling CFRP laminates were selected as quality character factors to optimize the drilling parameters to obtain the smaller-the-better characteristics. For thrust force and delamination quality character factors, the optimum conditions in drilling were also A1B1C3, (i.e., diameter ratio = 0.55, feed rate = 8 mm/min and spindle speed = 1,200 rpm).",

The material system used was T800H/3900-2 with polyamide-particle-dispersed epoxy layers at every ply interface. The laminate configurations were quasi-isotropic (0/45/90/-45)(s) and (45/0/-45/90)(s). The onset and growth of transverse cracks and delamination were observed with an optical microscope and by soft X-ray radiography. The transverse crack density was measured as a function of the number of stress cycles by edge observation. By means of X-ray observations, delamination onset and growth in the width direction are detected. A modified Paris-law approach which relates damage growth rate to the associated energy release rate range is applied to a quantitative characterization of both transverse crack multiplication and delamination growth.",

          "abstract": "The transition of delamination growth between different ply interfaces in composite tape laminates, known as migration, was investigated experimentally. The test method used promotes delamination growth initially along a 0/?? ply interface, which eventually migrates to a neighbouring ??/0 ply interface. Specimens with ?? = 60?? and 75?? were tested. Migration occurs in two main stages: (1) the initial 0/?? interface delamination turns, transforming into intraply cracks that grow through the ?? plies; this process occurs at multiple locations across the width of a specimen, (2) one or more of these cracks growing through the ?? plies reaches and turns into the ??/0 ply interface, where it continues to grow as a delamination. A correlation was established between these experimental observations and the shear stress sign at the delamination front, obtained by finite element analyses. Overall, the experiments provide insight into the key mechanisms that govern delamination growth and migration.",

The delamination is a major problem associated with the drilling fiber reinforced composite materials, which reduce the structural integrity of the material. The present work focuses on the analysis of delamination behavior as a function of drilling process parameters at the entrance of the CFRP plates. The delamination analysis in high speed drilling is performed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model with spindle speed, feed rate and point angle as the affecting parameters. A multilayer feed forward ANN architecture, trained using error-back propagation training algorithm (EBPTA) is employed for this purpose. Drilling experiments are conducted as per full factorial design using cemented carbide (grade K20) twist drills that serve as input–output patterns for ANN train- ing. The ANN model so developed is validated by presenting training and new testing input patterns. The validated ANN model is then used to generate the direct and interaction effect plots to analyze the delam- ination behavior. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the ANN models to analyze the effects of drilling process parameters on delamination factor. The analysis also demonstrates the advan- tage of employing higher speed in controlling the delamination during drilling.",

          "abstract": "A technique is presented for measuring the local crack tip displacement fields and the global applied parameters during mode I loading of delaminations in composite laminates up to and including failure. To achieve this objective, an instrumented loading set-up has been designed to fit inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). With this technique, the SEM images of loaded specimens are analyzed to obtain the crack opening displacements (COD) as a function of distance from the crack tip. For mode I tests conducted on AS4/3501-6 unidirectional material, good agreement is obtained between the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) calculations and the measurements, in terms of both general shape and magnitude. The results show that the COD increases linearly with the applied displacement up to failure. Thus, for the case of a brittle material under mode I loading, there is good agreement between the measured and calculated crack tip displacements, and the material behaves in a linear elastic way up to failure. By extending the technique to mode II and mixed-mode loading and by testing other tougher materials in the future, we hope to increase our understanding of mixed-mode failure criteria, which play an important role in the detailed analysis of complex composite structures under realistic loading",

The scaled FML laminates were arranged in a 2/1 configuration, and ply-level scaling of the FML constituent materials was employed to yield specimens with a nominally constant composite volume fraction, as well as correctly scaled in-plane and bending stiffness properties. In the initial part of this experimental program, the tensile and flexural properties of these hybrid materials were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. Here, no significant scaling effects were observed in the mechanical response of the laminates. Following this, simply-supported scaled beams and plates were subjected to low-velocity impact loading in order to investigate scaling effects in the processes of damage development and target perforation. Here, response parameters such as the target deflection, the impact force, and the damage threshold energy were found to obey the scaling law. It is believed that experimental data of this nature will give greater confidence to engineers involved in the design of components based on hybrid materials such as fiber-metal laminates.",

A three-dimensional block element was used to discretize the laminates, and a cohesive element was placed at the same planes as the delaminations.

In this paper, some difficulties regarding revealing damaged zone in drilling of woven carbon fiber-reinforced plastics laminates are discussed. In addition, different NDTs as well as available delamination factors are examined. For NDTs, clarity of pictures, applicability, and reliability are compared to help researchers select proper option. The result of this study demonstrates that compare to other available factors, the adjusted delamination factor Fda varies in wider ranges in normal engineering applications. It is less sensitive to the implemented NDT and it presents different values for different delamination extension patterns. Therefore, pattern-sensitive factor Fda is more suitable to quantify damaged zone. However, for cases with low circularity parameter f, like drilling of unidirectional composite laminates with extended damaged zone, Fda may be replaced by easily measured diameter delamination factor Fd.",

          "abstract": "Delamination is considered one of the most serious problems associated with the machining of fiber-reinforced composite materials. The evaluation of the drilling-induced delamination damage in these materials is rather difficult, particularly for the carbon fiber-based composites. This is attributed to their color that makes the current visual inspection techniques extremely difficult. This paper presents a non-contact nondestructive technique for measuring and determining the extent of delamination in composite materials. The approach developed consists of utilizing a shadow moir?? laser based imaging technique. This technique allows the assessment of the degree of delamination resulting from the machining processes necessary for final set-up and assembly. Mechanical drilling has been implemented on carbon fiber reinforced epoxy (CFRE) composites. The effects of cutting variables (feed and speed) on the delamination size in mechanical drilling of CFRE composites have been investigated. The discussed work should improve reliability and economy in fabrication and assembly of carbon fiber-based composites. Moreover, the results show that the proposed technique is easily adaptable to typical manufacturing environments and possesses promising advantages with respect to accuracy and simplicity. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "A fibre-metal laminate is a composite of metal and fibre-reinforced prepreg layers. An example of such a material is Glare. It consists of alternating layers of aluminium and glass-fibre-reinforced prepreg. The material can be sensitive to delamination buckling, which occurs when a partially delaminated panel is subjected to a compressive force. The interaction of local buckling and extension of the delaminated zone typically results in a decrease of the residual strength and, eventually, in a collapse of the structure. This phenomenon can be observed in experimental tests, but numerical analyses are needed to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms and the critical parameters. In this paper, some experimental observations are discussed regarding delamination buckling in Glare and, on the basis of these observations, a numerical model is constructed at a meso-mechanical level. In this approach, solid-like shell elements are used to model the individual layers. They are connected by interface elements, which are capable of modelling delamination between the layers. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The approach uses experiments to detect the failure mechanisms, two and three-dimensional stress analysis to determine the location of first matrix cracking and computational fracture mechanics to investigate the potential for cracks and delamination growth. The laminates strength and damage mechanisms obtained from both experimental and finite elements analysis are presented for several laminates lay-up configurations. Observations on the performed experiments show matrix crack initiation and propagation in the skin and near the flange tip, causing the flange to almost fully debounded from the skin in some cases, interlaminar debounding and fiber breakage up to the failure of the components. The finite elements analysis is also show that the matrix cracks are initiated in the first skin layer for most of the cases. With increasing the applied load the matrix cracks are propagated through the thickness to reach the next layer and causes delamination between the two layers. With increasing the applied load this delamination is propagated up to the occurrence of unstable delamination growth or the first fiber breakage known as the final failure of the component. The obtained experimental failure loads are compared with those calculated by the finite elements analysis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The tensile strain required to initiate transverse cracking in the 90-deg ply was found to depend on the thickness of the 90-deg layer. For n ≤ 3 delamination was initiated at the edge of the coupon. The onset of delamination occurred before or after transverse cracking, depending on the laminate construction. For n ≥ 4 delamination at the 25/90 interface was initiated across the entire width of the coupon by the formation of a transverse crack in the 90-deg ply. In some laminate constructions the location of specimen separation during final fracture was associated with the growth and coalescence of edge delaminations under either incrementally increasing or constant strain cyclic loading.

          "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced polymeric composites exhibit excellent mechanical properties over conventional engineering materials especially due to their great weight saving. Therefore, by considering the specific attributes of these materials, having a proper knowledge of dynamic behavior as well as static behavior of them is necessary. In order to study the effects of strain rate on the behavior of the materials, special testing machines are needed. Most of the researches in this field are focused on applying real loading and gripping boundary conditions on the testing specimens. This paper discusses the experimental study on the in-plane shear behavior of unidirectional glass fiber-reinforced polymeric composite under quasi-static and intermediate strain rate loading conditions. The symmetric and balanced ??45?? composite laminates are manufactured for characterization of the in-plane shear properties (modulus and strength) at various strain rates. Specimens are tested under uni-axial tensile loading using a servo-hydraulic testing apparatus. For performing the practical tests, jig and fixture are designed and manufactured. The performance of the test jig is evaluated and found to be adequate for composites testing. Dynamic tests results are compared with static tests carried out on specimens with identical geometry. The experimental results show that the mechanical shear properties are quite sensitive to strain rate. Under dynamic loading, the failure shear strength increased with increasing the strain rate but the shear modulus decreased. Based on the results obtained from the experiments, empirical functions for expressing the mechanical shear properties are proposed in terms of shear strain rate. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We give several examples of how sudden &quot;solution jumps&quot; can occur in rate-independent models like the Tvergaard depending on the geometry, interface behavior, and finite element discretization. This kind of instability disappears for the often-used viscous models, but the result is a high rate dependency that deviate from experimental trends. A new kind of viscous regularization is proposed here, which applies to the Tvergaard debonding model or modified ones, and has a limited rate dependency. A few simple examples are given, including the delamination of a double cantilever beam, to show the capabilities of the technique proposed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Three stacking sequences are considered. First, a baseline laminate with conventional 0°, ±45° and 90° orientations and without ply clustering. The other two laminates are dispersed laminates with orientations not limited to the conventional ones. In one of them, four layers of 0° fiber orientation are clustered together at the specimen mid-plane, whereas in the last configuration, two clusters of two layers of 0° fiber orientation are introduced at the specimen top and bottom surfaces. The in-plane and the out-of-plane stiffness of the dispersed laminates match within 2% those of the baseline laminate. Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is used to select the stacking sequences with the desirable clustering and stiffness constraints. The results obtained demonstrate that introducing clustering had a negative effect on the maximum peak load recorded at different impact energies and also on the projected delamination area. Regarding damage tolerance, the residual compressive strength can be improved up to 30% with ply clustering. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

First, monotonic and loading/unloading tensile tests were conducted on dry and wet specimens at ambient and high temperatures to compare the stress/strain response and damage development. The changes in the Young&#039;s modulus and Poisson&#039;s ratio were obtained experimentally from the monotonic tensile tests. The critical stresses for transverse cracking and delamination for the above three conditions are compared. The delamination area is measured by using scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) at various loads to discuss the effects of delamination on the nonlinear stress/strain behavior. Next, the stress distributions under tensile load including hygrothermal residual stresses are computed by a finite-element code and their effects on damage initiation are discussed. Finally, a simple model for the prediction of the Young&#039;s modulus of a delaminated specimen is proposed. It is found that moisture increases the critical stresses for transverse cracking and delamination by reducing the residual stresses while high temperature decreases the critical stresses in spite of relaxation of the residual stresses. The results of the finite-element analysis provide some explanations for the onset of transverse cracking and delamination. The Young&#039;s modulus predicted by the present model agrees with experimental results better than that predicted by conventional models.",

The focus is on the effect of the fiber bundle size and weave density of the fabric.

The carbon fabrics are thus of three types having areal densities between 200 and 600g/m2, and crimp ratios from 0.049 to 0.12. The laminates are manufactured through vacuum infusion process to minimize the effect of voids and poor resin regions. Tensile tests show serious differences in the behavior of the low and high areal density fabrics although the crimp ratio is about the same in some of the laminates. The low density fabric laminates show a linear stress-strain curve up to a sudden rupture of the laminate. The higher density fabric laminates present a stiffness degradation observed in their stress-strain curve which occurs after a plateau region or just a knee behavior. These high density fabric laminates encounter a severe delamination before the final failure.

A three-dimensional analytical method based on the classical lamination theory is developed to quantitatively determine the effective elastic constants of thick composite laminates with ply waviness. Various influential factors associated with ply waviness, such as the waviness geometry, the off-axis angle, the extent of wavy region, and the waviness pattern, are incorporated in the multi-parameter model. Analytical results for the Young’s moduli, the shear moduli and the Poisson’s ratios of wavy fiber composite laminates are obtained and discussed for a specific range of fiber volume fractions and two different lay-ups. Negative Poisson’s ratios are found for unidirectional laminates nested wavy ply/plies.

To this end, a unit cell with random fiber distribution is arranged point-symmetrically with respect to cell facet centers and also Y-periodically. By discussing these two fiber arrangements in terms of standard deviations and a radial distribution function, it is demonstrated that the point-symmetric cell arrangement can enhance the randomness of fiber distribution in comparison with the Y-periodic arrangement. Then, on the assumption that the random fiber distribution generated by the point-symmetric cell arrangement prevails on the transverse section in each lamina, the in-plane elastic-viscoplastic deformation of carbon fiber/epoxy laminates is analyzed using a homogenization theory of nonlinear time-dependent composites. The analysis based on the perfectly periodic hexagonal fiber distribution in laminae is additionally performed for comparison. It is thus shown that the transverse randomness of fiber distribution in laminae has negligible influence on the macroscopic elastic-viscoplastic behavior of laminates, though it markedly affects the microscopic distribution of stress and strain. It is also shown that the analysis predicts very well the macroscopic behavior observed in the corresponding experiments. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights rserved.",

Polished. thin sections removed from plain glass fiber/nylon composites and their corresponding fiber-metal laminates indicated that the prevailing microstructure was strongly. dependent on the rate of cooling from the melt. Mode I and Mode 11 interlaminar fracture tests on the plain glass fiber reinforced nylon laminates indicated that the values of G(Ic) and G(IIc) averaged approximately 1100 J/m(2) and 3700 J/m(2) respectively at all cooling rates. The degree of adhesion between the aluminum alloy and composite substrates was investigated using the single cantilever beam geometry. Here, the measured values of G, were. similar in magnitude to the Mode I interlaminar fracture energy of the composite, tending to increase slightly with increasing cooling rate. The tensile and flexural fracture properties of the plain composites and the fiber metal laminates were found to increase by between 10% and 20% as the cooling rate was increased by two orders of magnitude. This effect was attributed to over-aging of the aluminum alloy plies at elevated temperature during cooling. Finally, fiber metal laminates based on glass fiber/nylon composites were shown to exhibit an excellent resistance to low velocity impact loading. Damage, in the form of delamination, fiber fracture, matrix cracking in the composite plies, and plastic deformation and fracture in the aluminum layers, was observed under localized impact loading. Here, the fast-cooled fiber metal laminates offered superior post-impact mechanical properties at low and intermediate impact energies, yet very similar results under high impact energies.",

The geometrical non-linearity of the deformation of the laminate is also taken into account. Another model is the force-driven model previously proposed by Davies and Zhang. The combination of these two models forms a simplified and straightforward procedure for the prediction of the threshold impact energy for the onset of delamination without relying on a time-consuming dynamic analysis.

In the analysis of post-buckled delaminations, an important parameter is the distribution of the local strain-energy release rate along the delamination front. A study using virtual crack closure technique is made for three-dimensional finite-element models of circular delaminations embedded in woven and non-woven composite laminates. The delamination is embedded at different depths along the thickness direction of the laminates. The issue of symmetry boundary conditions is discussed. It is found that fibre orientation of the plies in the delaminated part play an important role in the distribution of the local strain-energy release rate. This implies that the popular use of quarter models in order to save computational effort is unjustified and will lead to erroneous results. Comparison is made with experimental results and growth of the delamination front with fatigue cycling is predicted. A methodology for the prediction of delamination areas and directions using evolution criteria derived from test coupon data is also described. It is found that evolution criteria based on components of the strain-energy release rate predict the rate of delamination growth much better than evolution criteria based on the total strain energy release rate. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Composite panels are widely used in aeronautic and aerospace structures due to their high strength/weight ratio. The stiffness and the strength in the thickness direction of laminated composite panels is poor since no fibres are present in that direction and out-of-plane impact loading is considered potentially dangerous, mainly because the damage may be left undetected. Impact loading in composite panels leads to damage with matrix cracking, inter-laminar failure and eventually fibre breakage for higher impact energies. Even when no visible impact damage is observed at the surface on the point of impact, matrix cracking and inter-laminar failure can occur, and the carrying load of the composite laminates is considerably reduced. The greatest reduction in loading is observed in compression due to laminae buckling in the delaminated areas. The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of the damage growth of impacted composite laminates when subjected to compression after impact loading. For this purpose a series of impact and compression after impact tests were carried out on composite laminates made of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin matrix. An instrumented drop-weight-testing machine and modified compression after impact testing equipment were used together with a C-scan ultrasonic device for the damage identification. Four stacking sequences of two different epoxy resins in carbon fibres representative of four different elastic behaviours and with a different number of interfaces were used. Results showed that the delaminated area due to impact loading depends on the number of interfaces between plies. Two buckling failure mechanisms were identified during compression after impact, which are influenced more by the delamination area than by the stacking sequence.",

A numerical model has been elaborated in order to simulate the different impact damage types developing during low velocity/low energy impact.

Inter-laminar damage, i.e. interface delamination, is conventionally simulated using interface elements based on fracture mechanics. Intra-laminar damage, i.e. matrix cracks, is simulated using interface elements based on failure criterion. Fiber failure is simulated using degradation in the volume elements. The originality of this model is to simulate permanent indentation after impact with a &quot; plastic-like&quot; model introduced in the matrix cracking elements. This model type is based on experimental observations showing matrix cracking debris which block crack closure. Lastly, experimental validation is performed, which demonstrates the model&#039;s satisfactory relevance in simulating impact damage.

Moreover, the microscopic properties of different composite specimens after fracture are watched and analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM).

This study then estimated laminate damage pattern from reflection spectra and investigated the influence of the sensor debonding on damage identification. The debonding length was estimated from the spectrum simulated with a given debonding length and was successfully identified only when an appropriate damage pattern was assumed. Moreover, greater debonding induced invalid damage-pattern estimates, even if the debonding length was given in the estimation. The damage identification for simulations and for experiments required half of the intact gage section. These estimates indicated that information on the damage pattern disappeared from the spectrum shape because of debonding. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

(1) A given level of microcracking damage causes a greater amount of degradation in mechanical properties in [[90m/0n]s laminates than in the corresponding [0n/90m]s laminates. (2) Although [[90m/0n]s laminates will initiate microcracks at lower loads, the corresponding [0n/90m]s laminates will develop more microcracks after continued loading. (3) A bending effect present in [90m/0n]s laminates but not in [0n/90m]s laminates promotes mode I delamination in [90m/0n]s laminates. ?? 1992.",

          "abstract": "Thick glass fibre reinforced laminates are investigated under both single and repeat static loadings using a flat-ended indenter. It is found that the behaviour of these laminates is dominated by damage mechanisms such as delamination and fibre shear-out. A force-based analytical model is developed to predict the onset of delamination. Under single monotonic loading, the analytical model not only describes the elastic behaviour up to the occurrence of delamination and predicts the critical load level at which delamination occurs, but also describes the post-delamination behaviour with modified stiffnesses. It is observed that the increase of laminate thickness increases the load level of the incipient delamination and is proportional to that of laminate load-bearing capability. Under repeat loading, it is found that the indentation laws are dependent not only on materials but also geometry, and that delamination has no permanent affect on the indentation laws. It is noted that the ultimate static resistance of S-glass/phenolic laminates when normalized with reference to thickness are much more superior than that of E-glass/polyester laminates. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

This study presents a new approach to terminate the interlayer peridynamic bonds. The critical stretch of a bond is implicitly determined by using the measured critical energy release rate values for different modes of deformation, and can vary depending on the degree of deformation. The bond failure occurs when the amount of energy required to remove the bonds across a unit surface equals the critical energy release rate of the interface between the two layers. This approach is applied to model delamination growth in double cantilever beam (DCB) (Mode I) and transverse crack tension (TCT) (Mode II dominated) specimens.

          "abstract": "Diffuse delamination induced by transverse cracking is usually the secondary damage mode when a composite laminate experiences tensile loading. The fist damage mechanism in such a laminate is transverse cracking which has been widely investigated with both analytical methods and &quot; mechanism-based&quot; constitutive laws. Delamination induced by matrix cracking is already studied extensively by analytical approaches, however, a proper homogenization way has not been proposed yet. In this paper, a modification to an available cohesive constitutive law is proposed which is capable of considering the effect of diffuse delamination without the necessity of consideration of an actual discontinuity between the layers. The proposed constitutive law is then compared against its equivalent models containing interlaminar discontinuity and it is shown that the obtained results from both models are in good. Then the proposed modification is used in Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimen and the obtained results are found coincident with the equivalent model with diffuse discontinuities at the interface. Finally, a damaged cross-ply laminate is modeled under the boundary conditions of tensile loading and also 3-point bending with and without the proposed cohesive modification. In tensile loading, the results of both cases are similar; however, it is shown that in bending, the unmodified cohesive law predicts the lateral stiffness larger than the proposed modification. The lateral stiffness of the equivalent model with discontinuities as crack indicates that the proposed modification is able to properly consider the lateral stiffness decrease. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The characterisation of the damage state of composite structures is often performed using the acoustic behaviour of the composite system. This behaviour is expected to change significantly as the damage is accumulating in the composite. It is indisputable that different damage mechanisms are activated within the composite laminate during loading scenario. These &quot;damage entities&quot; are acting in different space and time scales within the service life of the structure and may be interdependent. It has been argued that different damage mechanisms attribute distinct acoustic behaviour to the composite system. Loading of cross-ply laminates in particular leads to the accumulation of distinct damage mechanisms, such as matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fibre rupture at the final stage of loading. As highlighted in this work, the acoustic emission activity is directly linked to the structural health state of the laminate. At the same time, significant changes on the wave propagation characteristics are reported and correlated to damage accumulation in the composite laminate. In the case of cross ply laminates, experimental tests and numerical simulations indicate that, typical to the presence of transverse cracking and/or delamination, is the increase of the pulse velocity and the transmission efficiency of a propagated ultrasonic wave, an indication that the intact longitudinal plies act as wave guides, as the transverse ply deteriorates. Further to transverse cracking and delamination, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing the catastrophic failure of the composite and is expected to be directly linked to the acoustic behaviour of the composite, as the stiffness loss results to the velocity decrease of the propagated wave. In view of the above, the scope of the current work is to assess the efficiency of acoustic emission and ultrasonic transmission as a combined methodology for the assessment of the introduced damage and furthermore as a structural health monitoring tool. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "A first-order shear deformable plate theory-based method is developed to calculate the strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor of a non-homogeneous delaminated composite plate under a general three-dimensional (3-D) loading condition. By modeling the delaminated plate as two shear deformable sub-laminates on either side of the delaminated plane, the strain energy release rate is expressed in terms of three concentrated forces at the crack tip and their corresponding compliance coefficients. The simple expression of strain energy release rate makes the mode decomposition under complicated loading situation possible with the aid of two supplementary continuum analyses. To illustrate the present method, a plain strain delamination problem of laminates is examined, and the closed-form expressions of strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor are obtained. It is found that the available solutions, such as the ones based on the classical plate theory, can be recovered from the present solutions by simply neglecting the transverse shear force. The relationship between the global and local decompositions is further established, and the accuracy of the present solutions is examined by comparing with numerical results of boundary element method. With inclusion of transverse shear deformation in the formulation, more accurate and explicit predictions of the strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor of delaminated composite plate are achieved by the present method, especially when a laminate has a relatively low transverse shear modulus or moderate thickness. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

On the semi-log S-N curves obtained by fatigue tests, fatigue fracture is described by a straight line and the fatigue limit is not recognized clearly. In the on-axis fatigue tests, fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies develops in addition to ply-cracking damage in 90?? plies. The fiber-peeling damage was described by peeling-off of fiber bundles from the specimen surface after micro-scale damage of matrix resin and fiber-matrix interface. Most of the ply-cracking damage develops at an early stage of stress cycles, and slightly increases during fatigue, while the fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies initiates from the edges of 0?? plies and evolves in the whole area of laminates with an increase in stress cycles. The fatigue fracture seems to occur when the 0?? plies lose their load carrying capacity by the evolution of the fiber-peeling damage. In the off-axis fatigue tests, the fatigue fracture is caused by the initiation and evolution of ply-cracking damage and succeeding delamination. It is concluded that the fatigue strength is governed by the fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies under on-axis cyclic loading and by the ply-cracking damage and delamination under off-axis cyclic loading. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To create a better understanding of the initiation, growth and interaction of the different types of damage, damage monitoring during mechanical loading is very important. To this direction, AE is a powerful non destructive technique for real time monitoring of damage development in materials and structures which has been used successfully for the identification of damage mechanisms in composite structures under quasi static and dynamic-cycle loading. In this present work, pure resin plate and GFRP composite laminates with stacking sequence of [0(0)](6), are fabricated using Hand lay-up method. During the layup a Teflon tape of width 45 mm is kept in the mid plane of the laminate which serves as an initiator for delamination during loading. As per ASTM STD D5528 01 DCB (Double Cantilever Beam) specimens are cut out from the laminates and are subjected to tensile test in the transverse direction along with acoustic emission monitoring. While loading, Markings are made on the sides of the specimen to track the crack front using a magnifying lens. Parametric analysis is performed on the AE data obtained during crack propagation to discriminate the failure modes. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) enabled the calculation of frequency content of each damage mechanism. Further STFFT analysis is performed on a portion of the waveforms representing the dominant frequency content pertaining to each damage mechanism.",

This ‘mutual integral’ approach, for generalized plane-strain conditions, is based on the application of the path-independent J integral to a linear combination of three solutions: one, the problem of the laminate to be solved by using the quasi 3D finite element method; the second, an ‘auxiliary’ solution with a known asymptotic singular solution; and the third, the particular solution due to the out-of-plane loading. A comparison with the exact solutions is made to determine the accuracy and efficiency of this numerical method. With this ‘mutual integral’ approach, it was found that the calculated mixed-mode stress intensity factors of the free-edge delamination crack remain relatively constant as the crack propagates into the laminate. It was also found that the fracture criterion based on the mixed-mode stress intensity factors is more consistent with the experimental observations than the criterion based on the total energy release rate, and hence demonstrates the importance of the ability to calculate each individual component of the stress intensity factors. Furthermore, it was found that the fracture toughness measurements from double cantilever beam specimens can be used directly to predict the onset of delamination crack growth between two dissimilar laminae. By using these fracture toughness measurements from the double cantilever beam specimens, some examples are given to show that the fracture criterion based on the mixed-mode stress intensity factors can accurately predict the failure load for various laminates under tensile loading conditions.",

Evaluation and characterization of defects and damage require experience and good understanding of the composites. Under low-velocity impact loading delamination is observed to be a major failure mode. In this paper, the results of extensive experimental work on damage of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates due to low-velocity impact are presented. The study was carried out on 10 different layups over four different thickness. Both drop-weight and projectile impacts simulating practical conditions like tool-drop and runway debris, respectively, were carried out at energy levels varying from 3 to 30 J. The ensuing delamination damage was determined by ultrasonic: C-scans using the pulse-echo immersion method for both projected and layer-wise distribution. While projected delamination was obtained by placing a gate over the backwall echo, layerwise distribution was obtained by successive time delay from the frontwall to the backwall echo covering each interface. Delamination areas were quantified accurately by processing the raw image data using a digital image processing technique. Based on the data obtained an empirical relation was established between the delamination area and the impact energy.",

Three specimen types were tested: double cantilever beam (DCB), mixed-mode bending (MMB), and end-loaded split (ELS), for mode I, mixed-mode I + II, and mode II loading, respectively. Fracture mechanics technology was applied through the principles of strain-energy release rate. The measured delamination growth rates, da/dN, were correlated with the corresponding strain-energy release rates, ΔGI, ΔGT, and ΔGII. A large number of GII/GT mode ratios has been used in order to cover the maximum number of cases in the range from 0 to 100%. A semi-empirical fatigue criterion is proposed.

Specifically, the delamination energy under static and dynamic loading was obtained for both materials and both fracture modes, i.e. the number of cycles necessary for the onset of fatigue delamination. Subsequently, the crack growth rate (delamination rate) was obtained for different percentages of the critical energy rate. The main goal of the study was to ascertain the influence of the matrix on the behaviour of the laminate under fatigue loading. From the experimental results for the onset of delamination, similar fatigue behaviour was observed at a low number of cycles for both matrices and both fracture modes, while in fatigue at a high number of cycles, a higher fatigue limit was obtained in the composite with the modified resin (higher toughness) for both fracture modes. From the point of view of crack growth rate, both materials behaved similarly for different levels of stress under fatigue and the two fracture modes for small crack lengths (initial growth zone &lt; 5 mm), although the growth rate increased for large crack lengths. This behaviour was the same in both loading modes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A summary of several studies of delamination in tapered composite laminates with internal ply-drops is presented. Initial studies used 2D FE models to calculate interlaminar stresses at the ply-ending locations in linear tapered laminates under tension loading. Strain energy release rates for delamination in these laminates indicated that delamination would likely start at the juncture of the tapered and thin regions and grow unstably in both directions. Tests of glass/epoxy and graphite/epoxy linear tapered laminates under axial tension delaminated as predicted. Nonlinear tapered specimens were cut from a full-size helicopter rotor hub and were tested under combined constant axial tension and cyclic transverse bending loading to simulate the loading experienced by a rotor hub flexbeam in flight. For all the tested specimens, delamination began at the tip of the outermost dropped-ply group and grew first toward the tapered region. A 2D FE model was created that duplicated the test flexbeam layup, geometry, and loading. Surface strains calculated by the model agreed very closely with the measured surface strains in the specimens. The delamination patterns observed in the tests were simulated in the model by releasing pairs of multi-point constraints (MPCs) along those interfaces. Strain energy release rates associated with the delamination growth were calculated for several configurations and using two different FE analysis codes. Calculations from the codes agreed very closely. The strain energy release rate results were used with material characterization data to predict fatigue delamination onset lives for nonlinear tapered flexbeams with two different ply-dropping schemes. The predicted curves agreed well with the test data for each case studied. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This paper presents a methodology with which to model such migration. Firstly, the interlaminar shear at a delamination front were partitioned into axial and transverse modes, the mode-mixity of which was controlled by the mismatch between this front and the ply directions. An element formulation was presented which utilised this mismatch. Consequently, delamination migration was shown to have ensued when the transverse mode exceeded a critical mode-mixity Giii/GT=0.22. This approach was verified against experimental studies on width tapered end loaded split coupons by correlating the fracture morphology against mode-mixity. In particular, the orientation of the cusps on the delamination surface were shown to be controlled by the relative dominance of the axial and transverse modes. This methodology provides a means to accurately and robustly model progressive delamination growth processes in composite structures.",

          "abstract": "A new subcycle-based delamination growth model is proposed. The key idea is to model delamination growth at any time instant within a cyclic loading, rather than the cycle-averaged growth kinetics. First, some existing models are briefly reviewed for the fatigue delamination growth analysis of composite materials. Following this, two hypotheses are given for the derivation of the subcycle delamination growth model: (1) delamination growth does not happen during the unloading path and (2) delamination growth does not happen when the applied loading is below a reference level during the loading path. Mathematical expression is given for the calculation of delamination growth rate. Next, the extension of the proposed model is discussed to use both stress intensity factor and energy release rate as the driving force parameters, which are widely used in the open literature. Finally, the model predictions are compared with extensive experimental data under different stress ratios for model validation. One of the advantages of the proposed model is that the stress ratio dependent delamination growth can be predicted. Some conclusions and future work are drawn based on the proposed method. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The P-S-N diagram was produced based upon the fatigue test results, which was conducted on the satin woven glass fabric/polyester laminate. The dependences of fatigue life and its dispersion on the applied stress level and fatigue frequency are discussed. The failure mode under fatigue loading mainly consisted of three kinds: the fiber breakage, matrix cracking and interlaminar delamination, which clearly depends upon the stress level, in other words, fatigue life region. The test results indicated that the wider scatter of the experimental data has been observed in the life range of 105-106 cycles. This characteristic can be well explained by the fact that there exist several dominant failure modes including delamination damage in this life region. The tension fatigue test results conducted on quasi-isotropic carbon/epoxy laminates, [0/??45/90]S, revealed that the dominant fatigue failure mode is a progressive delamination damage at -45/90 interlayer. The paper also discusses a concept for improving the fatigue resistance of a quasi-isotropic CFRP laminate as a result of suppressing the delamination damage. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The adequacy of a fracture criterion to represent the experimental data for the effect of voids on the flexure strength, tensile strength, and interlaminar shear strength of composite laminates is assessed. The experimental program investigates the effect of different pressures and dwell times on the critical void content. Laminates produced with carbon fiber/epoxy resin unidirectional prepreg have been produced with an intentionally high void content. Short beam shear, three-point flexure, and tensile testing are used for mechanical evaluation and the results correlate to void volume fraction and ultrasonic absorption coefficient. The ultrasonic absorption coefficient is measured for all the specimens and its variation is approximately linear with the void content, corroborating previous experimental results. The effects of these factors on the strength of the composite laminates are discussed in terms of the fracture parameters involved in the fracture criterion.

Fiber characteristics and the influences of fiber type and loading rate on HDPE crystallization behavior and composite mechanical properties were investigated. Fiber length and aspect ratio distributions for all fibers followed a lognormal distribution after milling with two parameters defining the curve location (i.e., mean fiber length/aspect ratio) and shape (i.e., mean fiber length/aspect ratio distribution). For both VHDPE and RHDPE, rice straw fiber systems had comparable mechanical properties with those of wood composites. Increase in fiber loading led to increased moduli and decreased tensile and impact strength. Composite panels with rice husk had the smallest storage moduli, but their impact strength was comparable or better than that of other straw fibers. Very little difference in mechanical properties existed among leaf, stem, and whole straw fibers. The particular recycled HDPE resin and its composites had significantly better moduli and strength properties compared to the virgin HDPE systems due to additives used during initial processing. X-ray diffraction experiments showed that introducing fiber to HDPE matrix did not change characteristic peak position, but the fiber increased crystalline thickness of HDPE system. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed that VHDPE had significantly larger peak heat flow during cooling run than the RHDPE, indicating higher crystallization rates for VHDPE. The use of fiber in both resin systems led to the reduced peak heat flow rate. The study showed that rice straw fibers can work well with both VHDPE and RHDPE as reinforcing filler.

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0??/90??] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies.

A &quot;shear-lag&quot; damage analysis, using the nonlinear correspondence principle and appropriate failure criteria, is carried out to numerically predict the cracking evolution. This work shows that, though important, the material nonlinearity of the undamaged material does not significantly enhance the loading rate sensitivity of the cracking process and it cannot explain alone the phenomenon. On the other hand, taking into account the loading rate dependence of the critical strength, together with the R-curve effect, which gives good predicted cracking curves, suggests that the observed rate effect pertains to the viscoelastic character of the damaged material in the process zone close to crack fronts. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Loadings of pure mode I, pure mode II and different ratios of mixed mode I/II, i.e. opening tension and sliding shear, have been applied to double cantilever beam (DCB), end-loaded split (ELS), fixed-ratio mixed-mode (FRMM), and mixed-mode bending (MMB) specimens. Optical and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used to identify distinguishing fractographic features and to establish the differences between static and fatigue fracture, as well as the differences between the various modes of fracture. The cusp angle and the amount of fibre pull-out on the fracture surface can be used to characterise the different loading modes. A large amount of fibre pull-out is the dominant feature of a mode I fracture whereas cusps are characteristic features of a mode II fracture. Fatigue fracture surfaces exhibited slightly more debris than static fracture surfaces: this is thought to be due to the fretting nature of fatigue. For the same reason, shear cusps (hackles) were more rounded and less distinct in fatigue than on static fracture surfaces. In certain fatigue cases, it was observed that polyethersulphone (PES), a toughening agent used in the formulation of the epoxy resin, came out of the matrix; the reason for this is not fully understood. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science Limited All rights reserved.",

The compressive strength of unidirectional laminates is predicted based on the kink band formulation incorporating nonlinear behaviors. It yields a non-conservative prediction that typically contrasts with experimental results.

The FE models consider FMLs based on various stacking configurations. Both the transient and permanent displacements of the laminates are investigated. Good correlation is obtained between the measured experimental and numerical displacements, the panel deformations and failure modes. By using the validated models, parametric studies can be carried out to optimise the blast resistance of FMLs based on a range of stacking sequences and layer thicknesses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The mechanical characters of composite were described by bonds whose performance was depending on the distance and relative position of this couple of particles. In order to refine the description of composite&#039;s anisotropy, the concept of transverse modulus in classic laminate theory was introduced into the definition of bonds. Peridynamic parameters such as micromodulus and critical stretch were established following the similar concepts in elasticity theory and mechanics of composite. In this peridynamic model three types of damages in composite laminate could be analyzed: fiber fracture, matrix fracture and delamination. The mesh independency was also examined for this approach. In the examples of laminate with unidirectional and multidirectional layup, the progressive damages and failure modes were successfully analyzed under a tensile load and had a good agreement with experiments. Moreover, much more details in the procedure of damage initiations and propagations, including fiber broken, matrix fracture and delamination, could be revealed.

Authors have found that the electric resistance change method with response surfaces is very effective experimentally and analytically. However, a large error of estimation remains for estimation of delamination location.

Data from recent round robins performed by Technical Committee 4 (TC4) of the European Structural Integrity Society (ESIS) and from preliminary testing of additional CFRP epoxy laminates at the authors&#039; laboratories are analyzed with different approaches in attempts to reduce scatter and to identify parameters for CFRP structural design. Selected test data comparing load and displacement control for the cyclic fatigue tests are also discussed. Specifically, threshold values from Paris-law data fitting are compared with values from fitting with a modified Hartman-Schijve approach. Independent of the approach used for the analysis, mode I threshold values of selected CFRP seem to be in the range between about 30 and 100 J/m2, i.e., roughly around the range of critical mode I energy release rate values (denoted by GIC) obtained from fracture testing of neat commercial epoxy resins, but clearly below quasi-static initiation GIC-values for unidirectional CFRP composites. Implications for CFRP structural design based on mode I fatigue fracture mechanics test data are briefly discussed.",

The near-threshold growth of delamination fatigue cracks was investigated with seven kinds of unidirectional laminates made from brittle epoxy matrix, toughened epoxy matrix and thermoplastic PEEK matrix. Tests were carried out under mode I loading at different stress ratios. The fatigue crack growth behavior of laminates tested here was mainly controlled by the toughness of the matrix resin. The crack growth rate under different stress ratios was a unique function of the equivalent stress intensity range proposed by the authors. The parameter, ??, to indicate the relative contribution of the maximum stress to the cyclic stress was determined from the analysis of the stress-ratio dependency. For the toughened matrix system, the crack growth rate was mainly controlled by the stress range; the ?? value was small. On the other hand, for the case of brittle epoxy, the contribution of the maximum stress was large; the ?? value was large. The resistance against fatigue crack growth increased with the increase of the static fracture toughness. However, the ratio of the fatigue threshold to the static fracture toughness decreased with the decrease of the ?? value. Thus, the increase of the fracture toughness does not fully contribute to the fatigue crack growth resistance. The difference in growth behavior due to matrix resin and fibers was discussed on the bases of mechanism consideration and fractographic observation. ?? 1994.",

Behavioral maps are derived, which distinguish conditions under which multiple delaminations tend to propagate with equal lengths from those under which one of them tends to grow as a dominant crack with relatively high velocity. In homogeneous systems, equal length growth is favored when the delaminations are equally spaced through the thickness. While the behavioral maps are similar to those for static loading conditions, significant dynamic effects arise in the details of propagation: the maximum energy release rate depends strongly on the loading rate, duration and profile; dynamic effects and crack-interaction effects are generally coupled; and strong hammering effects (chaotic collisions of sub-laminates) can occur during the free wave motions that arise after the load is removed. The hammering effect can be suppressed by imposing a large-scale bridging mechanism (bridging extending far in the crack wake, as from pins or stitches), whereupon energy release rates tend to show smooth oscillations associated with waves propagating on the scale of the whole specimen. The energy absorbed during failure will depend significantly on whether conditions favor multiple delaminations propagating with equal lengths or a single delamination growing dominantly. © 2009.",

          "abstract": "This contribution focuses on the delamination phenomenon in a thin structural composite, which represents a major source of degradation during deformation in a composite material. The problem is resolved at a &quot;meso-level&quot;, where separate plies are explicitly modelled and connected via interfaces to form a laminate. A recently proposed formulation of the interface, cf. [Int. J. Numer. Methods Engrg. 54 (2002) 473], based on the regularized strong discontinuity concept, is used to model delamination considered as a damage process accompanied by regularized displacement discontinuity development. As to kinematics, since structural composites often can be considered as shells, shell kinematics is adopted for both the continuous and the discontinuous parts of the deformation. The discontinuous mid-surface and director are considered as independent fields from the corresponding continuous ones, whereby incompatible discontinuous modes within the finite element can be avoided. As compared to the other formulations in the literature, where a structural coupling of the layers of plies are normally emphasized, the present shell formulation focus on the consistent incorporation of a discontinuum with a regularized strong discontinuity in the context of shell kinematics. The paper is concluded by a numerical example involving delamination growth in a composite laminate. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Published experimental results show that through-thickness compressions increase the interlaminar shear (ILS) strength nonlinearly, which requires a nonlinear friction function. The proposed delamination criterion with a nonlinear friction function considers the full extent of the ILS increase observed in available experiments. Excellent agreements have been achieved between predicted and experimental failure envelopes with proper selections of parameters. The present theory is able to predict the shear strength enhancement in the presence of friction and compression more accurately than current methods.

The numerical approach presented is based on the framework of a cohesive zone model. A traction-separation law is presented which accounts for breakdown of the micromechanisms responsible for load transfer across bridged delamination cracks. The load transfer behavior is coupled to heat conduction across the bridged delamination crack. The coupled crack-bridging model is implemented into a finite element framework as a thermomechanical cohesive zone model (CZM). The fundamental response of the thermomechanical CZM is described. Subsequently, bridged delamination cracks of fixed lengths are studied. Values of the crack tip energy release rate and of the crack heat flux are computed to characterize the loading of the structure. Specimen geometries are considered that lead to crack opening through bending deformation and buckling delamination. The influence of critical mechanical and thermal parameters of the bridging zone on the thermomechanical delamination behavior is discussed. Bridging fibers not only contribute to crack conductance, but by keeping the crack opening small they allow heat flux across the delamination crack to be sustained longer, and thereby contribute to reduced levels of thermal stresses. The micro-mechanism based cohesive zone model allows the assessment of the effectiveness of the individual mechanisms contributing to the thermomechanical crack bridging embedded into the structural analysis. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Several parameters can affect the fatigue delamination growth in laminates - that includes e.g. constituent material properties and/or composite shape. Knowledge about effects of those parameters can lead to a better understanding of the fatigue delamination behavior and can also pinpoint directions for optimum composite design. Those effects can be elucidated by undertaking appropriate sensitivity analysis. Hence, a probabilistic approach to sensitivity analysis is proposed in this work to study the effects of composite parameters in a fatigue delamination problem of a two-layer composite. This approach combines together a fatigue delamination model, Monte Carlo simulations and the finite element method (FEM). As a result, probabilistic sensitivities are obtained in the form of correlation coefficients and also as trend-line gradients. Accuracy and efficacy of the approach is evaluated based on two numerical examples. The current approach is found to be insensitive to the parameter standard deviation and number of sampling points. Moreover, the current approach can be used irrespectively from the type of the boundary value problem (linear or non-linear) provided that the problem is solvable by the numerical method such as the FEM. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "The present paper discusses the results of an investigation into the effects of test rate and the mode of loading on the fracture energy, G c, of adhesively-bonded fibre-composite joints. Various carbon-fibre reinforced-polymer (CFRP) matrix composite substrates have been bonded using two different types of automotive structural epoxy-adhesives. They have been tested via loading the bonded joints in mode I (tensile), mode II (in-plane shear) and mixed-mode I/II from slow rates (i.e.; of about 10 -5 m/s) up to relatively high rates of test of about 15 m/s. The high-rate tests were photographed using a high-speed digital video camera to record the deformation of the joint and the fracture behaviour. An analysis strategy has been developed for the various modes of loading (i) to account for the observed fracture behaviour, (ii) to circumvent the problems posed by oscillations in the load traces due to the presence of dynamic effects in the faster tests, and (iii) to account for the kinetic energy associated with the moving specimen arms in the faster tests. Based on the analysis strategy developed, the effect of the test rate on the fracture energy, G c, for the different loading modes for the joints has been ascertained. Furthermore, various different fracture paths were observed in the tests. They were either cohesive, in the adhesive layer, or interlaminar in the composite substrates. The exact fracture path observed was a function of (i) the type of composite substrate, (ii) the type of adhesive, and (iii) the mode of loading employed. However, the nature of the fracture path was found to be quite insensitive to the test rate. Essentially, it was found that joints subjected to mixed-mode I/II loading were more likely to exhibit an interlaminar fracture path in the composite substrates than when loaded in either pure modes I or II. The propensity for a given joint to exhibit such a fracture path via delamination of the composite substrate has been explained by calculating the transverse tensile stresses induced in the loaded composite arms, and comparing this value to the measured transverse tensile strength of the composite. Following this approach, the underlying reasons for the observed fracture path were identified and could be predicted. Also, the proposed scheme provides a route to design against delamination failure occurring in adhesively-bonded fibre-composite test specimens. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Thus, an experimental process allowing interface loading under uniform stress field - either tensile or compressive - would be very helpful.

          "abstract": "Fibre Metal Laminates (FML) consist of bonded alternating thin aluminium and fibre/epoxy layers. Post-stretching of FML after curing is accompanied by plastic deformation which causes a reversal of the internal stresses due to curing which is favourable for their fatigue properties. The influence of this post-stretching on the delamination resistance was studied. The G(Ic) FML with aramid fibre (ARALL) was increased by post-stretching, No influence was found on the G(Ic) of glass fibre based FML (GLARE). The G(IIc) of FML was hardly influenced. The mode I and II delamination resistance of GLARE is significantly higher than that of ARALL. There appeared to be no relationship between these G(c)-values and the delamination of realistic structural details: the delamination of doublers as applied in aircraft wing panels. Post-stretching increased the delamination resistance of doubler specimens and despite its higher G(c)-values GLARE doubler specimens showed the same delamination resistance as ARALL. Although the delamination resistance of post-stretched doubler specimens was increased, the delamination progression after exceeding the delamination stress was for post-stretched material much faster than for as cured material, due to the larger amount of strain energy stored in the laminates during the post-stretching operation. Delamination fatigue tests indicated two competing mechanisms on the delamination growth rate. Therefore the delamination fatigue behavior is largely influenced by post-stretching, but the effect can be either positive or negative.",

          "abstract": "A three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model is created with cohesive zone elements (CZE) to simulate a mechanically fastened [0°/90°] s pin-loaded joint in a composite laminate. The model incorporates fully integrated solid elements in the pin-loaded area to accurately capture the high stress gradients. Contact based cohesive elements with a bilinear traction-separation law are inserted between the layers to capture the onset and growth of delamination. The stress distribution around the pin-loaded hole was verified with the widely used cosine stress distribution model. Results from the FE model show that delamination damage initiated at the point of maximum average shear stress at the 0°/90° interface. The delaminated area develops an elliptical shape which grows in a non-self similar manner with increasing pin displacement. It is concluded that a progressive damage model should be included to provide a full understanding of the failure sequence, work that the authors are currently engaged with. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

However, efforts to include fatigue delamination in the simulation of composites have not yet been consolidated. Besides that, there is a lack of a proper categorization of the published methods in terms of their predictive capabilities and the principles they are based on. This paper reviews the available experimental observations, the phenomenological models, and the computational simulation methods for the three phases of delamination (initiation, onset, and propagation). It compiles a synthesis of the current state-of-the-art while identifying the unsolved problems and the areas where research is missing. It is concluded that there is a lack of knowledge, or there are unsolved problems, in all categories in the field, but particularly in the category of computational methods, which in turn prevents its inclusion in the structural design process. Suggested areas where short-term and midterm research should be focused to overcome the current situation are identified.",

Furthermore, a shell model is established for compressive strength prediction, with delamination propagation assessed using a mixed mode criterion. The finite element (FE) prediction comes out to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements, for the predicted compressive strengths stand within 10% error of experimental results.

A modified Double Crack Lap Shear (DCLS) specimen was chosen for this study. An expression relating the delamination size and the compliance of a DCLS specimen was derived, and a test method for the delamination growth rate in DCLS specimens developed. The delamination sizes and the delamination growth rates of DCLS specimens were determined by monitoring the compliances of specimens during fatigue. Delamination growth rates at different stress ratios (R= 0.1, 0.3,0.5) were measured. A Walker-type equation for the delamination growth rate was obtained by a multiple linear regression analysis. It was shown that the compliance method for determining the delamination growth rate of DCLS specimens is not only convenient and practical, but also accurate. The delamination size in DCLS specimens increases linearly with cycles during fatigue, i.e. delamination growth rate is constant, independent of delamination size. The energy release rate was adopted to characterize delamination growth behaviour. Good agreement between the Walker equation and test results of the delamination growth rate was found.",

The effect of improved matrix toughness on the Mode II properties was determined by testing four different graphite fiber composite systems having widely different Mode I fracture energies. The results indicated that the benefits of improved matrix toughness on the composite properties were less under Mode II loading than under Mode I and were reduced further still, or eliminated entirely, under Mode II fatigue conditions.

The preceding interlaminar shear stress analysis for progressive damage is applied to the present test conditions, in order to obtain stress distributions and strain energy release rate as functions of two damage parameters which are the crack densities in 0?? and 90?? layers of the laminate. Experimental observations of damage evolution have also been carried out in T300/914 carbon/epoxy laminates, during thermal fatigue tests. The influence of temperature amplitude on damage is investigated throughout tests. Damage consists of matrix cracking in both 0?? and 90?? layers, followed by delamination along cracks at the 0??/90?? ply interfaces. It appears that, depending on the temperature amplitude, the damage evolution is either non-existent, rather slow, or very fast. It also appears that the predictions of the analysis are in good agreement with the experimental observations. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The ballistic limit was found through an iterative process such that the initial kinetic energy of the projectile would equal the total energy dissipated by panel deformation, delamination/debonding and fracture. The transient deformation of the panel as shear waves propagate from the point of impact was obtained from an equivalent mass-spring system, whereby the inertia and stiffness depend on the shear wave speed and time. Predictions of the ballistic limit from the resulting non-linear differential equation were within 13% of the test data. The deformation energy due to bending and membrane accounted for most of the total energy absorbed (84-92%), with the thinner panels absorbing a higher percentage of deformation energy than the thicker panels. Energy dissipated in delamination represented 2-9% of the total absorbed energy, with the thinner panels absorbing a lower percentage of delamination energy than the thicker panels. About 7% of the total energy was attributed to tensile fracture energy of the glass/epoxy and aluminum. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Demand for advanced engineering composites in the aerospace industry is increasing continuously. Lately, carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRPs) became one of the most important structural materials in the industry due to a combination of characteristics such as: excellent stiffness, high strength-to-weight ratio, and ease of manufacture according to application. In service, aerospace composite components and structures are exposed to various transient loads, some of which can propagate in them as cyclic impacts. A typical example is an effect of the wind gusts during flight. This type of loading is known as impact fatigue (IF); it is a repetition of low-energy impacts. Such loads can cause various types of damage in composites: fibre breaking, transverse matrix cracking, de-bonding between fibres and matrix and delamination resulting in reduction of residual stiffness and loss of functionality. Furthermore, this damage is often sub-surface, which reinforces the need for more regular inspection. The effects of IF are of major importance due its detrimental effect on the structural integrity of components that can be generated after relatively few impacts at low force levels compared to those in a standard fatigue regime. This study utilises an innovative testing system with the capability of subjecting specimens to a series of repetitive impacts. The primary subject of this paper is to assess the damaging effect of IF on the behaviour of drilled CFRP specimens, exposed to such loading. A detailed damage analysis is implemented utilising an X-ray micro computed tomography system. The main findings suggested that at early stages of life damage is governed by o degree splits along the length of the specimens resulting in a 20% reduction of stiffness. The final failure damage scenario indicated that transverse crasks in the 90 degree plies are the main reason for complete delamination which can be translated to a 50% stiffness reduction. © 2011 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In the finite element model developed, a through-width delamination is introduced close to one surface of a flat panel, and a void is placed in the delamination plane ahead of each delamination front. The panel is subjected to compression in the fiber direction. The postbuckling delamination growth is studied by calculating the strain energy release rate (SERR) using the virtual crack closure technique. Local stress analyses of the region near the delamination front are also performed to further investigate the void effects. It is found that although the presence of void does not significantly alter the postbuckling transverse displacement of the delaminated panel, the induced stress perturbation by the void affects the SERR. The Mode II SERR as well as the total SERR increase depending on the size of the void and its distance from the delamination front. Since the Mode I SERR shows non-monotonic behavior with the applied load, the effects of voids are studied on its maximum value. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5% in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "The chapter presents a comprehensive comparison of laminate failure models, which is established to assess the state of-the-art in laminate modeling technologies on an international level (known as the Worldwide Failure Olympics Exercise). It represents one contribution (called Part A of the Exercise) to the exercise, where predictions for laminate response and the failure behavior of various laminates, such as specific carbon- and glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy laminates under a broad range of loading conditions are made. The chapter describes a method for predicting the nonlinear stress/strain response and the failure behavior of composite laminates. Predictions are based on an incremental formulation of a well established three-dimensional laminated media analysis coupled with a progressive-ply failure methodology. Nonlinear lamina constitutive relations for the composites are represented using the Ramberg-Osgood equation. Piece-wise linear increments in laminate stress and strain are calculated and superimposed to formulate the overall effective nonlinear response. Individual ply stresses and strains are monitored to calculate instantaneous ply stiffnesses for the incremental solution and to establish ply failure levels. The progressive-ply failure approach allows for stress unloading in a ply and discrimination of the various potential modes of failure. The chapter presents laminate response and failure predictions for 14 different cases. The cases include prediction of the effective nonlinear stress vs. strain responses of laminates and initial and final ply failure envelope predictions under multiaxial loading.",

          "abstract": "This chapter presents failure envelopes for unidirectional composites and multilayered composite laminates, which have been predicted by linear laminate theory. There are three major failure modes in composites-namely, fiber failure, matrix failure, and fiber/matrix interfacial failure. Because, in general, the stresses in the fiber and matrix are different; their respective failures are determined by different stresses and have different failure mechanisms. Thus, a lamina failure criterion that separates matrix failure from fiber failure, such as the Hashin-Rotem criterion, is mechanistically more appropriate. The ply-by-ply discount method with parallel spring stiffness reduction model is used in the prediction. Laminate ply-by-ply failure analysis is performed on the basis of the 2-D stress field in the laminate. The stress/strain behavior of four laminates under uniaxial or biaxial loading is predicted by considering both material nonlinearity and progressive matrix cracking. Material nonlinearity is considered by using a one-parameter plasticity model for fiber reinforced composites. Progressive matrix cracking and the corresponding stiffness reduction are predicted by the use of a simplified shear-lag analysis and finite element analysis.",

          "abstract": "Composite panels are in common use, especially in aeronautic and aerospace structures due to their high strength/weight and stiffness/weight ratio. The out-of-plane impact loading is considered potentially dangerous mainly because the damage may be left undetected and because the loading itself acts in the through-the-thickness direction of the laminated composite panel. This direction is the weakest in the composite since no fibres are present in that direction. The impact loading can lead to damage involving three modes of failure: matrix cracking, delamination and eventually fibre breakage for higher impact energies. Even when no visible impact damage is observed at the surface on the point of impact, matrix cracking and delamination can occur, and the residual strength of the composite is considerably reduced. The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of the damage growth of impacted composite laminates when subjected to impact loading. For this purpose a series of impact tests were carried out on composite laminates made of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin matrix. An instrumented drop-weight-testing was used together with a C-scan ultrasonic device for the damage identification. Two stacking sequences of two different epoxy resins and carbon fibres, representative of four different elastic behaviours with a different number of interfaces were used. A numerical evaluation of these specimens was also carried out, using static analysis only. Results showed that the delaminated area due to impact loading depends on the number of interfaces between plies. Two failure mechanisms due to impact were identified, which are influenced by the stacking sequence and by the thickness of the panels.",

First, ultrasonic wavefield is obtained from a target structure by scanning a Nd:YAG pulse laser beam for ultrasonic wave generation and measuring the corresponding ultrasonic responses using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Then, hidden damages are identified and visualized through adoption of a standing wave filter, which can isolate damage-induced standing waves from the obtained wavefield. The proposed technique has following advantages over the existing techniques: (1) it does not require any sensor installation; (2) it is noninvasive, rapidly deployable and applicable to harsh environments; and (3) it can visualize damage with high spatial resolution without any baseline data, which enables automated and intuitive damage diagnosis. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated by visualizing a debonding in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic aircraft wing and a delamination in a glass fiber reinforced plastic wind turbine blade. Furthermore, the effects of temperature and static loading variations on the proposed technique are also examined. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Using a previously established delamination-based criterion for initiating damage during drilling, the critical feed rate for damage-free drilling was established for the two composite material types: aramid and carbon fiberreinforced polymer laminates. Independent measurements of the opening-mode delamination crack energy release rates were conducted on both materials to determine the critical thrust force for damage initiation.

To this aim, instrumented impact tests were carried out on glass fabric/epoxy laminates of three different thicknesses, using different energy levels. The irreversibly absorbed energy was obtained from the force-displacement curves provided by the impact machine. To assess damage progression as a function of impact energy, ply-by-ply delamination and fibre breakages revealed by destructive tests were measured. A previous model, based on energy balance considerations, was applied to interpret the experimental results, together with an original method of data reduction, allowing for the isolation of the maximum energy portion due to indentation and vibrational effects. From the results obtained, the contribution of fibre breakage and matrix damage to the irreversibly absorbed energy is comparable at low impact energies; with increasing initial energy levels, delamination becomes predominant in determining energy dissipation. However, the critical energy-release rate required to propagate delamination, as calculated from impact data, is considerably higher than the typical values deriving from Mode II delamination tests performed under laboratory conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The formulation is based on the Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) theory that fails to predict the delamination onset in composite laminates. The lack of resolving three-dimensional states and correct transverse stresses in this model is principally improved using post-processing. In order to precisely compute interlaminar stresses, a non-frictional linear adhesive contact model is applied in the context of the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The discontinuities are imposed within any arbitrary interface by enriching the displacement field. Thus two sub-domains define the plane of the discontinuity. Thereafter, the aforementioned adhesive contact can be formulated at the discontinued interface. Stress values are retrieved at nodal points using the interface constitutive equation. Consequently, the interface formulations are extended into the softening regime to model the delamination growth as a mixed-mode cohesive effect. The accuracy of the proposed method in predicting the interlaminar stresses and the delamination propagation is demonstrated by comparing the results with the ones available in literature. By combining the lower-order plate theory and the novel XFEM technique, the model is able to accurately calculate the delamination onset and the propagation with less computational effort.",

Damage is assumed to initiate when one of Hashin&#039;s failure criteria is satisfied, and its evolution is modeled by an empirical relation proposed by Matzenmiller, Lubliner and Taylor. The transient nonlinear problem is solved by the finite element method (FEM). Contributions of the work include considering damage in 3-D rather than plane stress deformations of a laminated structure and elasto-plastic deformations of the composite. This has been accomplished by developing a user defined subroutine and implementing it in the FE software ABAQUS. From strains supplied by ABAQUS the material subroutine uses a micro-mechanics approach based on the method of cells and values of material parameters of constituents to calculate average stresses in an FE, and checks for Hashin&#039;s failure criteria. If damage has initiated in the material, the subroutine evaluates the damage developed, computes resulting stresses, and provides them to ABAQUS. The damage evolved at a material point is not allowed to decrease during unloading. The delamination failure mode is simulated by using the cohesive zone model available in ABAQUS. The computed time histories of the axial load acting on the impactor are found to agree well with the experimental ones available in the literature, and various damage and failure modes agree qualitatively with those observed in tests. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

To the authors’ knowledge, it is for the first time in the literature that the thickness-dependence of translaminar fracture toughness is accounted for in the numerical modelling of composites. The thickness size effect in the strength of open-hole composite laminates failed by pull-out is accurately predicted for the first time by a deterministic model. It is found that neglecting delamination in the numerical models will lead to mesh-dependency and over-estimation on the predicted strength.

Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture tests were conducted using double cantilever beam (DCB) and end notch flexure (ENF) specimens to evaluate the proposed method. The changes in wave propagation velocity and wave magnitude (or attenuation), and the degree of waveform similarity between excitation and response signals, were calculated as delamination-sensitive wave parameters and plotted versus displacement recorded using a materials testing system. The kink points determined from wave parameter-displacement curves agreed well with the deviation from linearity (NL), visual observation (VIS) and maximum load (Max) points, which are often used in conventional methods for determining interlaminar fracture toughness. The propagation characteristics of the A 0 wave mode in a low frequency range were demonstrated to have high sensitivity to Mode I and in particular Mode II delamination onset in CF/EP composite laminates. It was concluded that the guided waves propagating in the DCB and ENF specimens were capable of determining Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness, complementing current practices based on visual inspection or trivial interrogation using load-displacement curve alone. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The properties under consideration include in-plane stiffness and strength under tensile and shear loading conditions, but the main focus of the paper is on the ability of blocks of Z-pins to resist the propagation of delamination cracking in lab coupon samples and in locally reinforced structural elements. The case of delamination in Z-pinned laminates under Mode I loading conditions is now well understood. The micro- mechanisms of failure are well characterised by single pin pullout experiments and modelling the behaviour of simple structures such as double cantilever beam has proved to be successful. The analysis of structures subjected to Mode II loading conditions, however, is proving to be much more of a challenge. Z-pinning appears effective in tests of standard delamination beams such as 3pt-End Notched Flexure (ENF) beams and 4pt �ENF beams. In particular, the catastrophic failure normally associated with the 3pt-ENF shear loading configuration is suppressed in the pinned samples. The micro-mechanisms of Z-pin deformation and failure involved in Mode II delamination are complex and the delamination resistance is thus observed to be strongly structure geometry dependent. In a low compliance test specimen geometry such as a thick double lap-joint, Z-pinning has been found not to improve the ultimate performance of the structure in static loading, whilst it can still extend the cyclic life of a fully delaminated joint under moderate loading. Recent results raise questions about the true mode mixity in the usual delamination tests and its consequences on the failure behaviour of Z-pinned laminates.",

Significant increases in elastic modulus and strength were observed for epoxies with functionalized MWCNTs, especially for esterified species. When MWCNT - filled epoxies were used as matrices for basalt fiber/epoxy laminates, however, the reinforcement effects of MWCNTs on the composite elastic modulus exceeded micromechanics based semi-empirical predictions and were independent of surface functionalization.

The carbon/nylon unnotched laminates exhibit a higher relative fatigue strength than the carbon epoxy unnotched laminates. Different fracture modes appear for the carbon/epoxy unnotched laminates, and the development of progressive and extensive delamination leads to a longer fatigue life and a larger reduction in tensile modulus. Such a fracture mode dependence is not observed for the carbon/nylon unnotched laminates. Regarding the notched specimens, the failure mechanism of the carbon/epoxy laminates is exclusively governed by the progressive delamination from the notch tips, while no appreciable effects of the notches are observed on the notch tip fracture of the carbon/nylon laminates. This much different notch sensitivity results in a slightly higher relative fatigue strength for the carbon/epoxy notched laminates.",

The model captures the discrete stochastic nature of the delamination growth process in laminated composite materials. Experimental data obtained using AS4/3501-6 coupons with a laminate stacking sequence of [±45/90/0], verifies that the model predicts the mean and variance associated with the delamination growth. Changing only one parameter in the model enables the model to predict delamination growth behavior at several load levels. Two parameters are identified that could possibly expand the model&#039;s predictive capability to include laminate geometries other than those used to correlate the model.",

This paper presents an experimental study of using carbon nanofibers (CNF) to improve the interlaminar fracture properties of polyester/glass fiber composites. Surfactant-treated CNF were dispersed in polyester resin and then the CNF-resin suspension was infused to impregnate a glass fiber preform using vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM). The manufacturability of using VARTM for thick and large CNF toughened composite parts has been experimentally investigated. The influence of CNF concentration on the CNF filtration in the glass fiber preform, the resin viscosity, and the micro-void formation has been examined. By choosing appropriate manufacturing parameters, we were able to use VARTM process to infuse the surfactant-treated CNF/resin matrix into the glass fiber preform and successfully manufactured the CNF toughened polyester/glass fiber composite specimens for mode-I delamination tests. The critical energy release rates of mode-I delamination (GIC) were characterized for several composite specimens with 1 wt% CNF concentrations and for those with pure resin. Significant improvement in the GIC was consistently observed as 1 wt% CNF were added to toughen the polyester resin. Microscopy pictures showed that the fracture surfaces of the 1 wt% CNF toughened polyester/glass fiber composite samples were more complex than the fracture surfaces of regular polyester/glass fiber composites. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Interface elements with de-cohesive constitutive law in the content of continuum damage mechanics can be used to predict initiation and growth of delamination in single and mixed mode conditions.

The model was programmed as the user element and user material by the &quot;User Programmable Features&quot; in ANSYS finite element software. The interface element is a three-dimensional 20 node brick with small thickness. Because of mixed-mode condition of stress field at the delamination-front of post-buckled laminates, a mixed-mode bilinear constitutive law has been used as user material in this model. The constitutive law of interface element has been verified by modelling of a single element. A composite laminate with initial delamination under quasi-static compressive Loading available from literature has been remodeled with the present approach. Moreover, it will be shown that, the closer the delamination to the free surface of laminate, the slower the delamination growth under compressive fatigue loading. The effects of laminate configuration on delamination growth are also investigated.",

The results showed that the critical load was nearly insensitive to the mixed-mode criterion used and, for delamination lengths in which the criteria did have some effect, the delaminations were self-arresting. In fact, a linear fracture criterion between the Mode I and Mode II fracture toughness values produced only slightly conservative values for the critical load. It was found that, for a given laminate, different delamination depths could be critical, depending upon the delamination length. Finally, the critical load for longer delaminations was found to increase proportionally with the square root of the Mode II critical strain energy release rate. ?? 1987.",

Compression failure of composite structures previously damaged by an impact event is due to the propagation of impact-induced damage mechanisms such as interlaminar debonding, constituent (i.e., matrix and fiber) microcracking, sublaminate buckling, as well as the interactions between these mechanisms. The failure mechanisms within each ply are idealized based on a reduced order multiscale computational model, in which, the damage propagation in the matrix and fibers upon compression is explicitly modeled. Delamination along the ply interfaces is idealized using a cohesive surface model. The initial impact-induced damage within the microconstituents and interfaces are inferred from experimental observations. A suite of numerical simulations is conducted to understand the sublaminate buckling, propagation of delamination and constituent damage upon compression loading. The numerical investigations suggest extensive propagation of delamination with mode transition preceding sublaminate buckling. Initiation and propagation of matrix and fiber cracking, observed upon sublaminate buckling, is the cause of ultimate shear failure. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

The accuracy of the micromechanics model under transverse shear loading is verified by comparing the results with those obtained using a general purpose finite element code. A higher order laminated plate theory is extended to capture the inelastic deformations of the composite plate and is implemented using the finite element technique. A complete micro-macro numerical procedure is developed to model the strain rate dependent behavior of inelastic composite laminates by implementing the micromechanics model into the finite element model. Parametric studies of the transient responses of composite plates are conduced. The effects of geometry, ply stacking sequence, material models, boundary conditions and loadings are investigated.

          "abstract": "The mesoscale composite damage model (MCDM) and a new component damage indicator are incorporated into a finite element code to predict the initiation and evolution of damage, and then final failure of fibrous composites structure subjected to combined loadings. The veracity of the method is demonstrated through applications to a stiffened, composite panel that is subjected to various combinations of tension, compression, shear and pressure loadings. The stiffened panel is modeled as a structure consisting of web, flange, skin and interface between the flange and the skin. Any other composite structure can be investigated at the pleasure of the investigator, subject to limitations on the computer resources required for the degree of scale desired. A component damage indicator, Dx,C, is defined as the average of the damage variable x, as determined by the MCDM, for each finite element in structural component C. If varying size elements are present in the component, a weighted average is used. When D reaches a value of 1.0, the component has no stiffness and completely lacks structural integrity. Experience indicates that D &gt; 0.4 suggests component failure. An important feature of D is that it permits damage trends in a component to be monitored. Stable damage growth corresponds to a structure with remaining integrity whereas unstable growth is a precursor to structural failure. Selected results are presented for as tiffened panel made from the carbon-epoxy material M55J/M18. It is shown that delamination is the predominate mode of failure for the cases considered and that the load level corresponding to the onset of delamination is a strong function of the type of combined loading. Failure strains are shown to vary by as much as a factor of three depending upon the type of loading. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Effective-time theory has been used to characterize the physical aging behavior of each linear viscoelastic lamina. In accordance with experimental findings, the aging behavior of each lamina is allowed to differ in the shear and transverse directions. The mechanical loading is restricted to the linear range, which decouples the aging and load behavior. A recursive algorithm has been used to solve the hereditary convolution integral that governs the response of each ply. Classical thin-laminate theory is then used to assemble the individual ply response equations and determine the overall laminate response to general in-plane force and moment loading. The method automatically recovers the ply-level stresses and strains, which are often critical to strength and durability predictions. The model can use either lamina compliance or modulus properties as its basis. Several illustrative examples of long-term laminate response to variable loading are presented and the impact of physical aging is explored. It is shown that for multidirectional laminates, the stiffness of the lamina in the fiber directions can allow simplifications of the model.",

The goal was to combine the accuracy of the full three-dimensional solution with the computational efficiency of a plate or shell finite element model. Multi-point constraints provided a kinematically compatible interface between the local three-dimensional model and the global structural model which has been meshed with plate or shell finite elements. Double cantilever beam (DCB), end notched flexure (ENF), and single leg bending (SLB) specimens were modeled using the shell/3D technique to study the feasibility for pure mode I (DCB), mode II (ENF) and mixed mode I/II (SLB) cases. Mixed mode strain energy release rate distributions were computed across the width of the specimens using the virtual crack closure technique. Specimens with a unidirectional layup and with a multidirectional layup where the delamination is located between two non-zero degree plies were simulated. For a local three-dimensional model, extending to a minimum of about three specimen thicknesses on either side of the delamination front, the results were in good agreement with mixed mode strain energy release rates obtained from computations where the entire specimen had been modeled with solid elements. For large built-up composite structures modeled with plate elements, the shell/3D modeling technique offers a great potential for reducing the model size, since only a relatively small section in the vicinity of the delamination front needs to be modeled with solid elements.",

The stroke rates ranged from 0.0167 mm/s (slow rate of loading) to 36 mm/s (fast rate of loading). This induced a strain rate in the CFRP of 2.96 με/s (slow rate) to 6,930 με/s (fast rate). Some beams were subjected to either 1 or 12 cycles of loading prior to a fast rate of loading to failure. The rapidly loaded beams showed an increase of approximately 5% in capacity, stiffness, and energy absorption. Ductility and the mode of failure were not directly affected by the change in loading rate. Precycled beams performed similarly to the beams loaded monotonically to failure but showed a 10% increase in service stiffness and a 10% loss in energy absorption. A finite-element, layered analysis is presented to predict the moment-curvature response of CFRP strengthened RC beams. The model includes the effects of strain rate and correlates well with the experimental data.",

Cryogenic tensile tests were conducted on the woven-fabric laminates, and the damage development during loading was characterized by AE (acoustic emission) measurements. A finite element model for progressive failure analysis of woven-fabric composite panels was also developed, and applied to simulate the &quot;knee&quot; behavior in the stress-strain responses and the damage behavior in the tensile test specimens. Failure of the epoxy resin matrix in the transverse fiber bundle was predicted to occur using the maximum strain failure criterion. The effect of strain concentrations due to the fabric architecture on the failure strain of the material was considered by incorporating the SVF (strain variation factor) from the meso-scale analysis of a woven-fabric composite unit into the macro-scale analysis of the specimens. A comparison was made between the finite element predictions and the experimental data, and the agreement is good. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The potential of this simulation approach for correctly predicting the through-thickness distribution of internal damage was specifically examined in the study. The constitutive models for intralaminar and interlaminar damage modes were incorporated into the ABAQUS/Explicit FE code by user-defined VUMAT material subroutines. The results of numerical simulations were compared with experimental data obtained by drop-weight impact testing and stereoscopic X-radiography. The developed FE model provided a correct prediction of the structural impact response of laminated samples over the range of impact energies examined and successfully simulated the temporal sequence of the major damage mechanisms. A reasonably good agreement was also achieved between numerical predictions and experimental observations in terms of shapes, orientations and sizes of individual delaminations induced by impact at the different interfaces. Additional numerical analyses were also conducted to investigate the influence of simulated intralaminar damage modes on the prediction of interface delaminations. The analyses show that implementation of intralaminar damage modes may be required for accurate simulation of the three dimensional delamination pattern induced by impact. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The idea of using specific sensors integrated in the structure for structural real time monitoring (or health monitoring) is now in progress. Carbon-fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP) are increasingly used as structural parts, especially in the aircraft industry. This work deals with the possibility of detecting in-situ damage in CFRP by the use of DC or AC electrical property measurements. Monotonic tests under post-buckling bending conditions are being performed on cross ply [0/90]s and [90/0]s carbon/epoxy laminates. The monitoring of electrical resistance and capacitance changes, linked to the modifications of the conduction paths in the composite, and occurrence of voids during loading, allowed the detection of damage growth. It seems that DC electrical conduction allows to detect fibre failure, but AC measurements are more suitable for monitoring matrix cracks (delamination, fibre/matrix debonding or transverse cracks). ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results indicated CNF addition offered simultaneous increases in tensile stiffness, strength and toughness while also enhancing both compressive and flexural strengths. Short-beam strength testing resulted in no apparent improvement while the fracture energy required for the onset of mode I interlaminar delamination was enhanced by 35%.

          "abstract": "Various cutting techniques are available to drill holes, but drilling is the most common way in secondary machining of composite materials owing to the need for structure joining. Twist drills are widely used in the industry to produce holes rapidly and economically. Since the twist drill has a chisel edge, increasing the length of a chisel edge will result in an increase in the thrust force generated. Whereas, a saw drill has no chisel edge; it utilizes the peripheral distribution of the thrust force for drilling. As a result, the saw drill can achieve better a machining quality in drilling composite laminates than twist drill. The deviation of cutting edge that occurs in saw drill would result in an increase of thrust force during drilling, causing delamination damage when drilling composite materials in particular. A comprehensive model concerning delamination induced by the thrust force of a deviation saw drill during drilling composite materials has been established in the present study. For a deviation saw drill, the critical thrust force that triggers delamination increases with increasing ??. A lower feed rate has to be used with an increasing deviation saw drill in order to prevent delamination damage. The results agree with real industrial experience. A guide for avoiding the drill deviation during drill regrinding or drill wear has been proved analytically by the proposed model, especially when the deviation ratio (??) affects the critical thrust force. This approach can be extended to examine similar deviation effects of various drills. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Emphasis is placed on following damage development at the non-crimp fabric ply-level by investigating the influence of voids on damage accumulation, most notably transverse cracking and delamination. Details from experiments include micrographs of voids taken in both scanning-electron and light microscopy, measurements of void content and crack density using light microscopy, and stiffness plots from both quasi-static and cyclic tests. The stiffness results are compared with theoretical predictions accounting for transverse cracks. Voids have a significantly more detrimental effect on the mechanical properties in cyclic loading compared with quasi-static loading. Specifically, the stiffness reduction development, the underlying transverse cracking in layers and the number of cycles to failure are affected. Quality control by only quasi-static testing for void-containing composite materials to be used in components subjected to fatigue cannot therefore be recommended.",

Understanding and improving the structural performance of FMLs therefore depends on characterizing the bridging phenomenon. Previously, mathematical models of bridging load transfer have been developed and verified for simplified circumstances:thin laminates with identical thicknesses and material composition through the laminate, identical crack lengths and delamination sizes, and simple tension loads. These models use a compatibility requirement at the delamination boundary to derive the bridging stress. This paper presents a generalized approach to solving the bridging problem that solves simultaneously for compatibility at every delamination boundary in the laminate, allowing the bridging load distribution to be derived for a laminate of arbitrary layup (different thicknesses and materials) with arbitrary damage (independent crack lengths and delamination sizes and shapes) and subject to arbitrary loading (any combination of applied tension and bending moment). The approach is evaluated by comparing its results to bridging stress distributions derived from finite element analysis. Good agreement was obtained for varied laminate and damage configurations, but some discrepancy exists in the presence of bending. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Currently the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test is being used for determining the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of unstitched and lightly stitched composite laminates. But the standard DCB test method is not suitable for laminates with medium to high density s titches. Due t o the high bending moment at the crack-tip, the specimens fail due to compressive stresses before the delamination could propagate. In order to overcome this limitation, a new fixture has been developed and used to perform Mode I fracture toughness tests on laminates with high density stitches. An analysis method has been developed to determine the load-deflection and the load-energy release rate relationships in the new test. The new test method has been found to be successful in testing graphite/epoxy laminates containing Kevlar stitches with a density of 64 stitches per square inch. The apparent fracture toughness of these specimens is about 45 times that of unstitched specimens.",

In contrast, the specific perforation energy of the GF/PEI FML system is lower than that of the plain PEI composite. The experimental evidence suggests that the inclusion of strong titanium alloy plies does not improve the perforation resistance of these FMLs. High velocity impact tests resulted in failure processes similar to those observed under low velocity loading conditions, with the specific perforation energy of the GF/PEI-based FMLs being higher than those exhibited by the plain GF/PEI composite.

Drilling is an essential machining operation being used in composite industries for making of holes for bolted joints. The conventional drilling, which is frequently used for making holes in polymer–matrix composite parts, is not convenient anymore because of plethora of challenges encountered. The major drawback is the drilling-induced damage, which mainly occurs due to the direct interaction between the tool and composite laminate. Therefore, there exists a research opportunity to develop cost-effective high-quality machining methods for composite laminates. In the present research endeavor, rotary-mode ultrasonic drilling process has been conceptualized and developed for the drilling of fiber-reinforced polymer composites. The influence of various process parameters including power rating, slurry concentration, and abrasive size on material-removal rate, tool wear rate, and average surface roughness (Ra) has been experimentally investigated. It has been observed that the entry and exit delamination is prevented, and hole circumferential edge quality is improved when holes are produced through rotary-mode ultrasonic drilling as compared to the conventional drilling. It has also been found that with substantial modification in the conventional ultrasonic drilling process, the drilling performance in terms of material-removal rate of glass-epoxy laminates can be significantly improved. The major contribution of the present research endeavor is the development of a novel method of making clean-cut damage-free holes in fiber-reinforced composite laminates.",

Analytical solutions for this problem do not exist due to the anisotropic nature and multilayer characteristics of composite laminates. This study uses a three-dimensional finite element (FE) method and experimental measurements to provide physical insight into the scattering phenomena. Good agreement is found between simulations and experimental measurements. The results show that the A(0) Lamb wave scattering at a delamination in composite laminates is much more complicated than the scattering at a defect in isotropic plates. Scatter amplitudes and scatter directivity distributions depend on the delamination size to wavelength ratio and the through-thickness location of the delamination damage. The study also investigates the feasibility of the common experimental practice of simulating delamination damage by bonding masses to the surface of composite laminates for guided wave damage detection and characterization methodologies verifications. The results suggest that care is required to use bonded masses to simulate delamination damage for verifying and optimizing damage characterization techniques. In summary, the results of the investigation help to further advance the use of the A(0) Lamb wave for damage detection and characterization.",

For this purpose, delamination propagation is modeled using the softening behavior of interface elements. The full layerwise plate theory is applied for approximating the displacement field of laminates and the interface elements are considered as a numerical layer between any two adjacent layers where the delamination is expected to propagate. A non-linear computer code was developed to handle the numerical procedure of delamination buckling growth in composite laminates using layerwise-interface elements. The load/displacement behavior and the contours of embedded and through-the-width delamination propagation for composite laminates are presented.

Drilling is a complex process, owing to their tendency to delaminate is used to join composite structures. In the present work, an attempt has been made to develop empirical relationships between the drilling parameters such as fiber orientation angle, tool feed rate, rotational speed and tool diameter with respect to delamination in drilling of GFR-polyester composites. The empirical relationship has been developed by using response surface methodology. The developed model can be effectively used to predict the delamination in drilling of GFRP composites within the factors and their limits are studied. The result indicated that the increase in feed rate and drill diameter increases the delamination size whereas there is no clear effect is observed for fiber orientation angle. The spindle speed shows only little effect on delamination in drilling of GFR-Polyester composites. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The proposed damage model is based on damage mechanisms observed at the ply level and hypotheses regarding their effect on material stiffness. Focusing on matrix dominated failure modes, the damage behavior is split into two contributions, damage evolution and damage effect. The prior describes the progression of damage as a function of load, while the latter predicts the effect of this damage by a fourth order tensor relation as function of the current failure mode and stress state. The model relies on six material parameters, whose identification by standard tests is addressed. By combining the damage model with classical lamination theory, the behavior of laminates under plane stress loading is predicted.

It revealed that matrix cracking, delaminations, tow debonding, and fibre fracture were the prominent damage modes.

A damage modelling technique based on a cohesive-zone method, which is more efficient than continuum damage mechanics approach, is proposed for analysis of interaction of damage modes. The developed numerical models are capable to simulate the damage mechanisms and their interaction observed in the tests.

A great deal of research has been focused on attempting to assess the relationship between interfacial structure and properties of fiber–matrix composites. It is at the interfacial area where stress concentration develops because of differences in the thermal expansion coefficients between the reinforcement and the matrix phase. A significant mismatch in the environmentally induced degradation of matrix and fiber leads to the evolution of localized stress and strain fields in the FRP composite. The present investigation aims to study the effects of changing hygrothermal conditioning cycles (either by changing relative humidity (RH) and keeping the temperature constant, or by changing the temperature while RH the same is maintained) on moisture gain/loss kinetics and on interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of varied weight fraction glass fiber reinforced epoxy and polyester matrices composites. The mechanical assessment is extended to evaluate the loading rate sensitivity of hygrothermally shocked glass/epoxy and glass/polyester laminates at 2 and 50mm/min crosshead speeds, respectively. Observations on absorption/desorption kinetics are noticed to be dependent on the nature of hygrothermal shock cycle and on the weight fraction of fiber reinforcement. The results of mechanical performance are statistically significant at different stages of conditioning. Shear values are found to be greater at higher crosshead speed for all undertaken situations.

Cohesive elements are used to express the complicated damage consisting of transverse cracking, splitting, and interlaminar delamination. The damage growth in the cohesive elements due to cyclic loading is represented by the conventional damage-mechanics model. The simulation was applied to notched Ti/CFRP hybrid laminates of two stacking configurations. In both cases, the crack growth rate in the titanium layer and the delamination shape agreed well with experiments reported in the literature. Complementary analysis for crack extension in the metal sheet is performed out of consideration of the damage in internal FRP layers. The numerical results demonstrated that the underlying damage modes in the FRP layer must be taken into account to predict the fatigue crack growth at the metal layer in FMLs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work an improved analysis for unidirectional composite delamination specimens is presented, which is based on the results of the last 30 years. The main goal of the present model is the improvement of the global mode decomposition method including four mechanical deformations apart from simple beam theory: Winkler-Pasternak foundation, transverse shear, Saint-Venant effect and crack tip shear deformation, respectively. These effects are investigated separately using a general loading scheme and at the final stage their results are superimposed. The derived model is applied to the mixed-mode I/II single-cantilever beam, the single-leg bending and the universal mixed-mode bending specimens. Beside the present solution three other ones are adopted to compare the results for the compliance and energy release rate of the mentioned specimens. Although the present model shows similar results to the most accurate finite element model, it is simpler and helps us to understand better the mechanisms of the delamination process. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a procedure based on a finite element formulation that can be used to perform numerical predictions of the impact induced internal damage in composite laminates. The procedure is based on simulating the composite performance using a micro-mechanical approach named matrix-reinforced mixing theory, a simplified version of the serial/parallel mixing theory that does not require neither the iterative procedure nor the calculation of the tangent stiffness tensor. The numerical formulation uses continuum mechanics to simulate the phenomenon of initiation and propagation of interlaminar damage with no need to formulate interface elements, resulting in a computationally less demanding formulation. To demonstrate the capability of numerical procedure when applied to a low-velocity impact problem, numerical results are compared with the experimental ones obtained in a test campaign performed on 44 laminates specimens subjected to an out-of-plane and concentrated impact event, according to ASTM test method. Results are in good agreement with experimental data in terms of delamination onset and the internal spatial distribution of induced damage. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The tensile strength of the 0??plies within different cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates of varying size and stacking sequence has been investigated. For those lay-ups having failure confined to the gauge section, no size effect was observed in the strength of 0??plies. In laminates exhibiting a size versus strength relationship, failures were found to occur in the gauge section for the smallest laminates, but at the grip for the larger laminates. The occurrence of failure at the grips is not obvious for these lay-ups. A major purpose of this paper is to identify the failure initiation point, and the sequence of events that leads to complete fracture of 0??plies in unidirectional laminates, and the quasi-isotropic and cross-ply lay-ups. A statistically significant set of 3-point bend tests of unidirectional beams was conducted to obtain valid parameters (Weibull modulus and strength) for a Weibull-statistics-based strength model which would be used to predict the ultimate strength of 0??plies within different cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates. No significant difference between the maximum stress in bending or strength of the valid tensile tests was found. In contrast Weibull theory predicted unidirectional strength loss of over 30% for the range of volumes tested. Although the dramatic strength scaling observed here has been shown to arise from the test method, the authors are not ready to rule out scaling effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Strain rate behavior of composites with fiber waviness was also studied. Falling weight impact system and servohydraulic testing machine were used for dynamic characterisation of composite materials in compression at strain rates up to several hundred per second. Strain rates below 10s−1 were generated using a hydraulic testing machine. Strain rates above 10s−1 were generated using the drop tower apparatus developed. Seventy-two-ply unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminates (IM6G/3501-6) loaded in the longitudinal and transverse directions and [(08/908)2/0̄8]s crossply laminates were characterised. Off-axis (30 and 45°) compression tests of the same unidirectional material were also conducted to obtain the in-plane shear stress–strain behavior. The 90° properties, which are governed by the matrix, show an increase in modulus and strength over the static values but no significant change in ultimate strain. The shear stress–strain behavior, which is also matrix-dominated, shows high nonlinearity with a plateau region at a stress level that increases significantly with increasing strain rate. The 0° and crossply laminates show higher strength and strain values as the strain rate increases, whereas the modulus increases only slightly over the static value. The increase in strength and ultimate strain observed may be related to the shear behavior of the composite and the change in failure modes. In all cases the dynamic stress–strain curves stiffen as the strain rate increases. The stiffening is lowest in the longitudinal case and highest in the transverse and shear cases. Unidirectional and crossply specimens with fiber waviness were fabricated and tested. It is shown that, with severe fiber waviness, strong nonlinearity occurs in the stress–strain curves due to fiber waviness with significant stiffening as the strain rate increases.",

The quasi-static contact test was performed using a 12.7 mm hemispherically-tipped indentor. On the other hand, impact was conducted using a gas gun with projectiles of the same frontal shape weighing 8.7 g, 17.7 g and 35.5 g. The test speeds were from several m/s to the ballistic limits of the laminates. The impact response was measured using the self-developed laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) system and was subsequently converted into the force and displacement histories. Significant loading rate effects were observed when comparing the laminates loaded quasi-statically to those struck by projectiles with a four-fold difference in mass. These effects included differences in the impact force history, a drastic increase of the force peak and the absorbed energy, and a completely different delamination damage pattern. Thus, the loading rate effect for composite laminates reinforced by glass fibers cannot be overlooked. On the other hand, fiber breakage throughout the plies on the distal side of laminates was found to absorb a significant amount of impact energy. The absorbed energy versus the initial projectile energy for the dynamically loaded specimens, when plotted in a non-dimensionalized manner, was found to have a bilinear relationship regardless of the projectile mass employed. This bilinear line was also closely bounded from below by the quasi-static results.",

          "abstract": "Delamination is the most frequent failure mode in laminated composite materials and it may cause catastrophic failure in critical engineering structures. One of the ways to prevent this failure is to toughen the crack against initiation and propagation. There is lack of studies in literature for toughening the delamination using nanofibers, especially in the case of fatigue behavior. Therefore, the present work aims to investigate effect of interleaved nanofiber mat on fatigue interlaminar properties of mode I delamination in carbon-epoxy composite laminates. To reach this aim, the electrospun polyamide nanofiber fabrics were put in the mid-plane of woven carbon/epoxy laminates. Then the fatigue Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) tests were performed on both virgin and nanomodified specimens, based on ASTM D6115. The experimental results show that the interlaminar fracture toughness and delamination onset fatigue life of the specimens can be substantially improved by addition of the Polyamide nanofiber interlayer. As a matter of fact, there is negligible increase in the thickness of the specimens, less than 1%, but there is noticeable out-plane mechanical properties increase of the modified specimens. The increases in the delamination toughness are up to 150%, at the static tests, and around 100% at the high cycle fatigue loading conditions. Crack paths were investigated by micrograph analysis and different behaviors in the virgin and nano-modified ones were observed and related to the different mechanical results.",

Finally, the penetration between two delaminated layers in the buckling mode can be effectively prevented by inserting these artificial springs into the overlapped area in the buckling mode. Numerical examples indicated that this method is very efficient for solving the contact problem in buckling analysis. Its accuracy and convergence speed are very high. The numerical results demonstrate that the contact analysis is very important for buckling analysis in some cases.

          "abstract": "Glass fiber reinforced composite materials are used in variety of engineering applications due to their important properties. Armour steel - GFRP composites are used in application areas such as military vehicles, tanks, automobile etc. These composites provide strength with corrosion resistance. Drilling of these composite materials are very much important for the industry. During drilling, due to the use of glass fibers reinforcement delamination occurs. Reduction of delamination is important for the manufacturers. This paper investigates a study on cutting parameters on the delamination in drilling of an armour steel Glass fiber reinforced sandwich composites. Armour steel is used as a sandwich, which is fixed between the two glass fiber reinforced composite plates. The influence of cutting parameters on delamination in drilling is investigated in detail. From the analysis of the results, it has been known that the feed rate is the highly influential parameter which affects the delamination in drilling of sandwich composites. The results are analysed through graphs and presented in detail. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "A study is made on the low velocity impact response and post-impact mechanical capacity of woven fiber [0/90,-45/45,0/90]s carbon epoxy composite plates. This complements the work done by numerous other researchers who have also examined low velocity impact of composites, but have focused on unidirectional, cross-ply or quasi-isotropic laminates. In the present study, post-impact static uniaxial tension, compression, as well as tension-compression fatigue tests are performed. The damage mechanisms for woven laminates are found to be predominantly delamination and fiber breakage, with the area of impact-induced delamination increasing linearly with impact energy for the range of energies examined. Damage extent and type are also dependent on the curvature of the impactor tip and deformation generated by a sharp impactor is more localized. The existence of a threshold energy level below which no delamination discernible by C-scan occurs is noted. In contrast with previous findings, it is observed that the peak in the impactor deceleration-time response is not associated with the onset of fiber failure, which can occur earlier. The amount of energy absorbed when this peak occurs therefore does not indicate the energy required to initiate fiber breakage. It is observed that residual tensile strength is a function of delamination area and impactor tip radius. For static compression and tension-compression fatigue, the residual load-bearing capacity is only dependent on delamination area. Under compression, delamination promotes the micro-buckling of fibers, whereas in tension, failure is predominantly via fiber breakage. For a common impact energy and impactor, a damaged specimen is weaker in compression than in tension.",

Initial attention focused on investigating the effect of varying the fibre orientation, ??, on the tensile modulus and strength of a range of [Ti, ????]s carbon-fibre/PEEK FMLs. Here, as expected, increasing the offset angle, ??, resulted in a decrease in the tensile properties of the FMLs. The failure mechanisms in the hybrid laminates were investigated through a series of cyclic tensile tests on a number of edge-polished samples. An examination of the specimen edges indicated that failure in laminates whose fibres were oriented at angles between 0?? and 15?? occurred as a result of fracture of individual carbon fibres. At offset angles greater than 15??, initial failure took the form of localised debonding at the fibre-matrix interface. In addition to this debonding, laminates with values of ?? between 15?? and 45?? exhibited delamination between the composite plies. First ply failure (FPF) as well as the tensile strength of the FMLs was predicted using a number of simple failure criteria. Here, it was shown that the onset of damage under tensile loading conditions can be successfully predicted over a wide range of offset angles. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This system can send and receive broadband Lamb waves efficiently in a specific direction, and the MFCs and FBGs can be integrated into composite laminates because of their flexibility and high fracture strain. In this research, this system was applied to detect an interlaminar delamination in carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates. One MFC and one FBG were bonded on each surface of the CFRP laminate to generate and receive the symmetric modes and the anti-symmetric modes separately for identification of the multiple modes of Lamb waves in the laminate. Then we investigated the mode conversion of Lamb waves at both tips of a delamination in the middle of the thickness of the lamimate, through an experiment and finite element analysis (FEA). On the basis of the knowledge about the mode conversion, an index to evaluate the delamination length was proposed using velocity changes by the mode conversions. From the results of experiments and FEA for the laminates with an artificial delamination, this new index was found to be effective to evaluate the delamination progress in the laminate quantitatively.",

Recent advances of health monitoring technologies have resulted in development of micro-dimensional sensors that can be embedded into composite laminates. Notwithstanding their small sizes, such inclusions may affect the response of the composite. Damage induced by the peak values of stress concentration around the embedded devices is, in fact, one of the main concerns. To assess this and related issues, we have fabricated a series of samples with and without embedded (dummy) sensors and micro-processors in S2 glass fiber/epoxy laminates, and systematically tested the samples while continuously monitoring the response by the acoustic emission technique. In this manner we have sought to address the process of damage initiation and evolution within the material. The results show that acoustic events begin earlier on during the loading process, in specimens with embedded sensors and the source of the damage is located near the sensors. These early events are associated with matrix failure at the sensor-resin interfaces through micrographic observations.",

Ultrasonic C-scans and micrographs were used for the post-test damage inspection, where matrix cracking and delaminations were observed as the major impact damage modes. Tensile preloading was found to reduce the extent of delaminations, while compressive preload led to an increased extent of delaminations resulting from a higher bending deflection of the plate under impact.

After impacting thin woven carbon/epoxy laminates using hemispherical, ogival and conical steel impactors all 12 mm in diameter using a drop weight test rig (Mitrevski et al., 2005), various post-impact analysis techniques have been employed, such as non-destructive inspection (NDI) and microscopy to assess the effect of impactor shape on the resulting damage. The blunter hemispherical impactor produced the largest damage area dominated by delamination. The rather sharp conical impactor produced the most fibre breakage which resulted in a localised damage area and the largest indentation/penetration depth. A significant reduction in tensile strength was found for all specimens. The specimens impacted by the hemispherical impactor at 4 J experienced a slightly higher residual tensile strength due to the barely visible impact damage (BVID) induced which was dominated by delamination. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Polished thin sections removed from plain glass fiber/nylon composites and their corresponding fiber-metal laminates indicated that the prevailing microstructure was strongly dependent on the rate of cooling from the melt. Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture tests on the plain glass fiber reinforced nylon laminates indicated that the values of GIc and GIIc averaged approximately 1100 J/m2 and 3700 J/m2 respectively at all cooling rates. The degree of adhesion between the aluminum alloy and composite substrates was investigated using the single cantilever beam geometry. Here, the measured values of Gc were similar in magnitude to the Mode I interlaminar fracture energy of the composite, tending to increase slightly with increasing cooling rate. The tensile and flexural fracture properties of the plain composites and the fiber metal laminates were found to increase by between 10% and 20% as the cooling rate was increased by two orders of magnitude. This effect was attributed to over-aging of the aluminum alloy plies at elevated temperature during cooling. Finally, fiber metal laminates based on glass fiber/nylon composites were shown to exhibit an excellent resistance to low velocity impact loading. Damage, in the form of delamination, fiber fracture, matrix cracking in the composite plies, and plastic deformation and fracture in the aluminum layer, was observed under localized impact loading. Here, the fast-cooled fiber metal laminates offered superior post-impact mechanical properties at low and intermediate impact energies, yet very similar results under high impact energies.",

It is shown that the amplitude of the reflection of the S0 mode from a delamination is strongly dependent on the position of the delamination through the thickness of the laminate and that the delamination locations corresponding to the maximum and minimum reflectivity correspond to the locations of maximum and minimum shear stress across the interface in the S0 mode",

The laminated specimen is represented as an assembly of sublaminates, each of which is modelled as an elastic beam partly connected to the other by a deformable interface, in turn considered to be a continuous distribution of elastic-brittle springs. Based on Timoshenko&#039;s beam theory, a set of six differential equations, accompanied by suitable boundary conditions, governs the problem. By adopting the interfacial stresses as the main unknowns, the differential problem is solved analytically, and the contributions of the opening and sliding fracture modes are evaluated directly. Moreover, explicit expressions are determined for the interfacial stresses, internal forces, and displacements, as well as for the compliance, energy release rate, and mode-mixity angle. The predictions of the model are to some extent similar to those of analogous mechanical models in the literature and appear in good agreement with both numerical and experimental results. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

New methods of evaluating the effective or apparent critical strain-energy release rate for stitched laminates are presented. Stitching results in an excellent improvement in GIIc The apparent GIIc was 5 to 15 times that of the unstitched laminates, depending on the stitching parameters.

It was reported that the delamination of AFRMLs resulted from cracking Al alloy layers and that it depended on the crack propagation. When AFRMLs with circular holes were not cracked but were delaminated, it was impossible to analyze them by conventional fracture parameters expressed as a function of crack size. Therefore, a new analytical model called pseudo-crack model (PCM) was suggested to compare the delamination, whether cracked or not.

The model is derived by postulating the existence of a maximum load surface which limits the adhesive forces in the process zone of the crack. The size of this maximum load surface is made dependent on the amount of dissipated crack opening work, such that the maximum load surface shrinks to zero as a predefined amount of work is consumed. A damage formulation is used to reduce the adhesive forces. Mode I, II and III loading or any combined loading is possible. An analytical solution is obtained for a single mode opening and the implications of this result on the governing equations is discussed.

          "abstract": "Delamination is a major problem associated with drilling fiber-reinforced composite materials that, in addition to reducing the structural integrity of the material, also results in poor assembly tolerance and has the potential for long-term performance deterioration. Delamination-free in drilling different fiber reinforced thermoset composites is the main objective of the present paper. Therefore the influence of drilling and material variables on thrust force, torque and delamination of GFRP composites was investigated experimentally. Drilling variables are cutting speed and feed. Material variable include matrix type, filler and fiber shape. Drilling process was carried out on cross-winding/polyester, continuous-winding with filler/polyester, chopped/polyester, woven/polyester and woven/epoxy composites. A simple inexpensive accurate technique was developed to measure delamination size. The results show that the presence of sand filler in continuous-winding composites not only raised the values of cutting forces and push-out delamination but also increased their values with increasing cutting speed. In contrast, increasing the cutting speed in drilling cross-winding, woven and chopped composites reduces the push-out delamination as a result of decreasing the thrust force. The thrust forces in drilling continuous-winding composite are more than three orders of magnitude higher than those in the cross-winding composites. Chopped composites have lower push-out delamination than those made from woven fibers. For the same fiber shape, the peel-up and push-out delaminations of woven/epoxy composite are lower than that for woven/polyester composites. Delamination, chipping and spalling damage mechanisms were observed in drilling chopped and continuous-winding composites. In drilling woven composites the delamination was observed at different edge position angles due to the presence of the braids that made by the interlacing of two orthogonal directions of fibers tows (warp and fill). Delamination-free in drilling cross-winding composites was achieved using variable feed technique. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Micro-buckling failure of the struts was not observed in the experiments reported here. Analytical models for the collapse of the composite cores by Euler bucking, delamination failure and micro-buckling of the struts have been developed. Good agreement between the measurements and predictions based on the Euler buckling and delamination failure of the struts is obtained. The micro-buckling analysis indicates this mechanism of failure is not activated until delamination is suppressed.

Calculations of the shear toughness were carried out in accordance with the methods proposed in the ESIS protocol. Critical experimental details are reviewed and the influence of the different procedures proposed for the data assessment of results is analyzed.

Comparisons between the results obtained by this procedure and the experimental results of the literature show that for very low crack densities the progression of transverse cracking is governed by a strength distribution associated with weakness areas resulting from the presence of particular defects in laminates. Next, for higher crack densities the strength distribution in the 90??layer can be described by a pseudo-normal distribution associated with the other defects.

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the self-healing repair of delamination cracks in a carbon fibre-epoxy laminate using the mendable thermoplastic poly[ethylene-co-(methacrylic acid)] (EMAA). The effects of different types (fibres or particles) and concentrations of the mendable EMAA agent on the self-healing efficiency was measured using mode I interlaminar fracture toughness testing and fractographic analysis. The EMAA was effective in healing delamination damage and increasing the fracture toughness compared to the original laminate. High healing efficiency was achieved by the wide area flow of EMAA (increase of ∼25 times) through delamination cracks under the pressure delivery mechanism. High recovery in the fracture toughness was achieved after healing by the formation of large-scale EMAA-bridging ligaments along the delamination, which is a toughening mechanism unique to this type of self-healing material. EMAA proved effective for the multiple repairs of delamination cracks with some loss in the self-healing efficiency of the mendable laminates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Experimental results showed that fiber failure is a prominent phenomenon and an important reason for the knee point on the dent depth-impact energy curves of composite laminates subjected to low-velocity impact. The finite element model to predict the permanent indentation incorporated fiber failure in the anisotropic elasto-plasticity theory. Delamination was also taken into account in the finite element model using cohesive elements. The permanent indentation numerically predicted agreed well with the experimental results.

          "abstract": "A test method, with specimen design similar to that proposed by O&#039;Brien et al. (see [23-26]) but under 3-point bending, is proposed to measure the critical strain energy release rate (G c) for delamination in fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) under out-of-plane (transverse) loading. Unlike end-notch-flexure (ENF) test or double-cantilever-beam (DCB) test that are currently used, the new method does not require an insert film or a pre-crack to initiate delamination. Instead, the delamination was initiated from a FRP layer of the same composition but with different fibre orientation. Difference of the fibre orientation used in this study was 90° layer in the mid-thickness and the rest 0° layers. Under 3-point bending, matrix shear cracking was firstly initiated in the 90° layer, mimicking the mechanism for delamination initiation in the FRP when subjected to transverse loading. The matrix shear cracking led to delamination in the adjacent interlaminar regions, of which area can be measured after the test. Calculation of G c was based on &quot;area method&quot;, that is, dividing the total energy loss by the delamination area. The G c was compared with that from plate specimens of the same composition and fibre lay-up but subjected to transverse point loading. The comparison suggests that very similar G c values were produced from the two types of testing, even though unstable crack growth occurred under 3-point bending and stable crack growth under transverse point loading. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential of quantifying delamination resistance of FRP under the transverse loading conditions. © Springer 2005.",

The output response measured were acoustic emission characteristics such as root mean square of the signal, rise time, counts, energy, duration, peak amplitude, counts to peak, hits, average frequency, delamination, thrust force, and torque. The monitored parameters were analyzed and concluded that it is enough to monitor root mean square of the acoustic emission signal alone since all the other acoustic emission parameters are very closely related to acoustic emission root mean square.

          "abstract": "Abstract The reasons of increasing use of composite laminates in modern aircrafts, vehicles and other applications are related to their high specific strength and modulus, together with their flexibility in design. Delamination is one of most common failure mechanisms for composite materials. By interleaving a nanofibrous mat between laminate plies it can be possible to control the interlaminar delamination strength. The nanofibrous mat at a laminate interface is impregnated by the resin during the curing process. In previous works, the authors tested delamination toughness and identified the cohesive zone properties of nanomats with varying fibre diameter, fiber arrangement (random, aligned) and mat thickness. The results showed that, by varying those parameters, a toughening or an embrittlement of the interface can be obtained. The modification induced by the nanomat can be therefore exploited in order to tailor the interply delamination strength of the laminate. The aim of this work is simulate the impact strength of a composite laminate giving different strength to interplies in order to proof that it is possible to increase the impact energy absorbed by the composite, in the perspective of optimization for use in impact attenuation.",

The burst pressure of composite vessels for different layer structures is predicted using finite element analysis. In the reliability analysis, two design parameters for composite vessels: the radius of polar axis and the winding thickness of each composite layer at the cylinder are assumed to obey the uniform distribution and Gaussian distribution respectively, and the burst pressure of composite vessels is taken as the random output response. Effects of the number of sampling and the limit strength on the strength reliability of composite vessels are explored. Besides, the numerical results obtained using two methods and two distributions for two random input parameters are compared in terms of the calculation efficiency and accuracy. Numerical results also indicate the proposed probability method exhibits preferable advantage over the conventional design method merely using empirical safety coefficient. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism is simply proved through a superposition technique. An explicit approximate expression to estimate energy-release rate is derived. The possible energy release rate attained without shear failure or severe non-linearity is also given and found to be increased roughly in proportion to the thickness of the specimen. Since the attainable G(III) value without severe damage in the other portions may not be large enough to measure the fracture toughness of tough fiber-reinforced-plastic composites of the usual coupon size, it may be necessary for the specimens to be modified in order to obtain the mode-III interlaminar toughness, G(IIIc). The present experimental method is still attractive as a test method to measure mode-III fracture toughness of the composite laminates owing to its simplicity which compares well with the DCB and ENF testing methods.",

This work was aimed at studying the off-axis tension-tension fatigue behavior of woven-ply C/PPS laminates which consists of three primary stages: (i) In the initial phase of cyclic loading, damage accumulates rapidly along with a matrix plasticization under the form of intra-laminar cracking which may initiate in multiple locations, but preferably at the interfaces between fibers and matrix at the crimps - (ii) The second stage is characterized by a steady damage growth rate and little damage accumulation - (iii) Damage (mostly debonding and interlaminar cracks) generalizes rapidly during the last stage ultimately resulting in extensive delamination and fiber bundles pull-out. It also appears that the fatigue behavior is ascribed to the highly ductile and time-dependent behavior of matrix-rich regions due to the non-planar structure of woven plies.

A component can be single phase, like fibers or particles used as reinforcement in a homogenous matrix, or a multiphase material like a layer in long-fiber laminate. In the latter case the degradation of adhesion implies the separation of the layers, known as delamination. Among all different failure mechanisms, &#039;Delamination&#039; is considered to be the most prominent mode of failure in fiber-reinforced laminates as a result of their relatively weak inter-laminar strength. When laminated structures are subjected to static, dynamic or cyclic loadings, the inter-laminar adhesion strength between individual plies tends to deteriorate significantly and act as the origin of the final failure. Therefore, an efficient and reliable design tool capable of predicting delamination could improve the durability for composite laminates. There exist damage mechanics based formulations capable of simulating the delamination crack growth in carbon/glass fiber epoxy based composite laminates. The present study is focused on taking a step forward in this respect. At first, already existed local interface model&#039;s effectiveness is tested and results are successfully compared with available experimental data for UD IMS/924 Carbon/fiber epoxy composite laminate. Next, a non-local integral-type regularization scheme is introduced to overcome the spurious localization problem associated to the existing local model. Basic concepts and mathematical modeling of Non-Local damage evolution law are comprehensively studied and presented in this study. Finite Element simulation results based on proposed model are discussed in detail and are compared with experimental results.",

All exposed specimens suffered a loss in delamination toughness and an increase in fatigue delamination growth rate, which was particularly significant for deicing fluid exposure. The number of cycles for delamination onset was also reduced by these exposures, although scanning electron micrographs showed no significant differences between the fracture pattern of dry and exposed specimens. It was also shown that environmental effects can be simply accounted for in a cohesive zone based finite element model. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In notched tension, the non-traditional laminates were less strong and stiff than their traditional counterparts, but X-ray images clearly showed the suppression of longitudinal splitting and delamination.

The change in interfacial shear sliding stress due to cyclic loading-unloading was obtained by a thin specimen push-back test. The interfacial shear sliding stress decreased slightly after cyclic loading and this behaviour originated from wear of the sliding interface. The crack growth rate of the composite, da/dN, vs. crack length relation was strongly affected by the interaction process. Elastic constraint before interface partial symmetrical debonding and crack bowing after this debonding were the major sources of da/dN reduction of the composite. After the matrix crack surrounded the fiber, da/dN was slowed by the crack-shielding mechanism originating from fiber bridging. This process continued throughout the tested number of applied cycles, because the interfacial shear sliding stress transfer operated during cyclic loading. The three-dimensional crack-fiber interaction process during crack propagation and its effects on da/dN under cyclic loading in a fiber-reinforced brittle matrix composite were discussed.",

The material, consisting of alternate layers of aluminium and glass fibre reinforced epoxy, is however complicated to model numerically. This paper deals with the modelling of FML and is focused on a detailed simulation of the inter rivet buckling behaviour in a stiffened fuselage shell. The skin material consists of FML and is modelled with solid elements, layer by layer. Each of the constituents are provided with their respective material model. For the glass fibre reinforced epoxy the user subroutine UMAT is employed for description of the failure modes, such as matrix cracking and fibre failure. The behaviour of the delamination between the metal layer and the fibre reinforced epoxy is also described with a user subroutine UINTER, which is an optional contact definition. This subroutine contains a failure criterion for the delamination. The rivets between the stiffener and the skin of a fuselage are modelled by elastic solid elements with a plastic material model, but without any failure criterion. This reflects the design, where no rivet failure is allowed prior to buckling of the skin. A specially designed experimental test, which captures the main characteristics of inter rivet buckling, is modelled and simulated. The numerical results are compared to the experimental data. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are given for future research.",

Vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) and vapor grown carbon nanofiber (VGNF) were chosen as the reinforcement for the interlayer. To illustrate the effect of the interlayer on the fracture toughness of the laminates, several types of carbon fiber reinforced plastics/carbon nanofiber (CFRP/CNF) hybrid laminates were fabricated. Each laminate was composed of unidirectional carbon/epoxy prepregs with carbon nanofiber varying the interlayer thickness. Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness was evaluated by a standard double cantilever beam (DCB) test. Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness was evaluated by an end notched flexure (ENF) test using a three point bending test. The experimental results of the DCB test confirms that the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness for hybrid laminates is about 50% greater than the base CFRP laminates. Furthermore, the results of the mode II fracture toughness test confirms that the interlaminar fracture toughness for hybrid laminates is 2-3 times greater than base CFRP laminates. In addition, the results revealed the recommended range of CNF interlayer thickness is between 100 and 150 ??m (approximately 20 g/m

Ballistic projectile with an aspect ratio of three fired from either a compressed gas or a powder gun at speeds varying from 30 to 310 m/s, with the initial and final velocity (when present) of the striker always measured, in addition to selected high-speed photographic recording.

For the dynamic case, the predictions were 70-96% of the observed expenditure level. This is considered to be due to the absence in the analysis of factors such as inertia, strain-rate and wave propagation effects, matrix shearing and fragmentation, as well as obliquity and rotation motion of the striker. The correspondence in the case of static loading was considerably poorer, indicating substantial and non-measurable energy absorption by the test apparatus, including substantial frictional dissipation in in the specimen holder and between sample and penetrator. ?? 1994.",

In particular, steady state dynamic crack growth for a Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) loaded with a flying wedge is examined. The steady state crack propagation characteristics are mapped out in terms of controllable loading and material parameters including the crack velocity and the properties of the through- thickness reinforcement. For small crack velocities, the through-thickness reinforcement considerably enhances the delamination resistance of the structure. At higher velocities, the kinetic energy term dominates the overall energetics and the relative effect of the reinforcement on the delamination resistance is insignificant.

In order to evaluate these properties, the Split Cantilever Beam (SCB) fracture test is performed. The load is applied to a test specimen through a set of identical grips in order to reduce (in some degree) the mode II loading at the free edges. A three-dimensional finite element analysis is used to study the stress and strain state of the specimens and to interpret the experimental measurements. The strain energy release rate is calculated by using the virtual crack closure technique. It is found that the strain energy release rate is dominated by the mode III component. A non-uniform distribution of the strain energy release rate along the delamination front is obtained with mode III component having maximum at the center of the delamination front, while mode II component increases towards the free edges. The strain energy release rate is also determined using the crack closure technique. A finite element analysis is also carried out to calculate the stress intensity factors for the SCB specimens. The fracture surfaces are examined by scanning electron microscopy to identify the fracture mechanisms. The most important conclusion from the present study is that at temperature lowering from 293 to 20 K the mode III fracture toughness increases, further cooling to 4 K produces a toughness decrease.",

          "abstract": "The strain-rate sensitivity of a hot-compacted formed self-reinforced thermoplastic composite, based on polypropylene fibers in a polypropylene matrix, was investigated through a series of quasi-static and dynamic tensile tests. Characterization of the mechanical property dependence on strain-rate for a self-reinforced thermoplastic is an important issue when the material forms one part of a hybrid system, as in the case of a thermoplastic fiber—metal laminate that is prone to localized impact loading events. Strain-rates in the range from quasi-static (10—4 s—1) up to 10 s—1 were achieved in the gauge region of rectangular specimens loaded in a servo-hydraulic test machine. A measurable rate effect was observed in key mechanical properties of the self-reinforced composite, and constitutive equations were successfully applied to characterize the strain-rate behavior of the yield stress. Failure of the longitudinal ply fibers was the dominant failure mechanism, whilst the degree of inter-ply delamination varied over the dynamic loading range.",

A detailed description of techniques employed for testing composite materials at a wide range of strain rates is given. Recent relevant test results are presented showing the variation of mechanical properties with strain rates for unidirectional and multidirectional laminates under in-plane loading. The paper then concentrates on current activities on indirect determination of unidirectional dynamic properties from the behaviour of angle ply laminates by means of an extraction process. Theoretical procedures for extracting the longitudinal, transverse and in-plane shear properties are outlined. An extension to those procedures allowing simultaneous determination of transverse and in-plane shear moduli of a ply is introduced and results using this method are presented for KRP and CFRP under combined strain rate and temperature. Existing theories and mechanisms describing the combined effects of the temperature and the strain-rate on the mechanical response of composite materials are outlined. © 1998 Trans Tech Publications.",

This paper presents an optimisation strategy for the design of postbuckling behaviour of VAT composite laminates under axial compression. The postbuckling performance of composite laminated plates for a given compression loading is assessed by studying both the maximum transverse displacement and the end-shortening strain. For the postbuckling analysis of VAT composite plates, an efficient tool based on the variational principle and the Rayleigh-Ritz method is developed. In the optimisation study, a mathematical definition based on Lagrangian polynomials, which requires few design parameters, is used to define a general fiber angle distribution of the VAT plate. A genetic algorithm is subsequently used to determine the optimal VAT configuration for maximum postbuckling performance. The optimisation of square VAT laminates under compression loading for different in-plane boundary conditions is studied and compared with straight fiber designs. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The various models, developed by the author, are applied to the majority of the Third World-Wide Failure Exercise Test Cases, which included thin and thick cross ply and quasi-isotropic laminates, loading and unloading of an angle ply laminate, bending of a general laminate, and cracking under thermal loadings. Methods used to predict ply properties from those of the fibres and matrix are also described. Crack density in the 90 degree plies was modelled using a ply refinement technique.

The shock testing was performed in a small-scale underwater explosion facility, and by using larger explosive charges and smaller separation distances between the charge and GRP, it was possible to exert higher underwater shock wave pressures on the laminate. The laminate was then fatigue tested in tension-compresion at a stress ratio, R, of - 1 to obtain S-N curves. At low shock pressures the laminate experienced a small amount of cracking in the polymer matrix, but this did not alter the fatigue performance compared with the unshocked laminate. At high shock pressures the laminate experienced gross structural damage in the form of polymer cracking, delamination between the polymer and glass fibre, and fracture of the glass fibres. These effects caused a large reduction in the fatigue resistance. ?? 1995 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Two basic designs, one for the tensile opening mode ( Mode I) and one for the forward shear mode ( Mode II) , are described. These specimens were used to characterize the behaviour of two types of interfaces (0/0 and 0/90) for static fracture, constant amplitude fatigue, and spectrum fatigue. Fracture mechanics technology was applied through the pronciples of strain-energy release rate. Three- dimensional finitepelement analyses were employed to interpret the experimental results. A simple growth law was shown to correlate the constant-amplitude and spectrum-growth data. It was found that the applied cyclic load must be nearly equal to the critical static load to obtain observable growth in the tensile opening mode. On the other hand, the graphite-epoxy delamination growth rate in the forward shear mode is comparable to the aluminum growth rate in tension , which suggests that shear is the chief subcritical growth mode for graphite-epoxy.",

A finite element-based numerical scheme is also developed to evaluate the critical strain energy release rate, GIc, associated with matrix micro-cracking, a parameter that previously required fitting with experimental data. Furthermore, the prediction scheme is improved to account for the statistical variation of GIc within the material volume by using a two-parameter Weibull distribution. The variation of GIc with increasing crack density is also accounted for based on reported experimental evidence. The simulated results for carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy cross-ply laminates demonstrate the ability of the improved model to predict the evolution of multidirectional ply cracking. By integrating this damage evolution model with the synergistic damage mechanics approach for stiffness degradation, the stress-strain response of the studied laminates is predicted. Finally, biaxial stress envelopes for ply crack initiation and pre-determined stiffness degradation levels are predicted to serve as representative examples of stiffness-based design and failure criterion.",

Failure strength was determined at room temperature and at selected elevated temperatures up to heat distortion temperatures of the resin systems. Laminates without inside hoop layers performed very poorly compared to laminates with inside hoop layers, in both tension and compression. In tension tests of tubes with no inside hoop layers, the tensioned helical fibers pulled away from the laminate in a localized delamination failure mode, called transverse fiber pullout. The predicted interlaminar stresses at which this occurred are considerably lower than expected through-the-thickness strength, probably because of the highly localized nature of the failure mechanism. In addition to the tube tests, modified double cantilever beam tests were conducted with acoustic emission monitoring to investigate delamination toughness of hoop wound materials.",

Combined tension and bending loading was applied to non-linear tapered flexbeam laminates with internal ply drops. These laminates, consisting of coupon specimens cut from a full-size S2/E7T1 glass-epoxy flexbeam were tested in a hydraulic load frame under combined axial-tension and transverse cyclic bending loads. The magnitude of the axial load remained constant and the direction of the load rotated with the specimen as the cyclic bending load was applied. The first delamination damage observed in the specimens occurred at the area around the tip of the outermost ply-drop group. Subsequently, unstable delamination occurred by complete delamination along the length of the specimen. Continued cycling resulted in multiple delaminations. A 2D finite element model of the flexbeam was developed and a geometrically non-linear analysis was performed. The global responses of the model and test specimens agreed very well in terms of the transverse flexbeam tip-displacement and Happing angle. The FE model was used to calculate strain energy release rates (G) for delaminations initiating at the tip of the outer ply-drop area and growing toward the thick or thin regions of the flexbeam, as was observed in the specimens. The delamination growth toward the thick region was primarily mode II (shear), whereas delamination growth toward the thin region was almost completely mode I (opening). Material characterization data from cyclic double-cantilevered beam tests was used with the peak calculated G values to generate a curve predicting fatigue failure by unstable delamination as a function of the number of loading cycles. The calculated fatigue lives compared well with the test data.",

It is possible to mitigate this inherent limitation and enlarge the design space by using thin plies. This paper presents an experimental study, using a spread tow thin ply carbon-epoxy prepreg material with a cured ply thickness of 0.03 mm, which shows that highly non-linear stress-strain behaviour can be achieved with angle-ply laminates, whilst suppressing the damage mechanisms that normally cause their premature failure. Several angles between 15?? and 45?? are investigated in a [????5]s layup. It is shown that for all angles delaminations are suppressed, allowing considerable pseudo-ductile strains to develop. Significant fibre rotations take place, permitted by matrix plasticity, leading to a post-yield stiffening of the laminate, as the fibres reorient towards the direction of loading.",

The model uses a cohesive zone law that is derived from quasi-static R-curves to determine the bridging energy applied in the bridged region. Timoshenko beam theory and an iterative self-consistent scheme are used to calculate the bridging tractions and displacements. After applying the bridging model to crack propagation data the scatter in the data was significantly reduced and clear trends were observed as a function of temperature that were not apparent previously. This indicated that the model appropriately accounted for the bridging in the experiments.

          "abstract": "Small mass impacts on composite structures are common cases caused by hailstones and runway debris. Small mass impactors usually result in a wave controlled local response, which is independent of boundary conditions. This response occurs before the reflection of waves from the boundaries and cannot be modeled by large mass drop weight tests. An elasto-plastic contact law, which accounts for permanent indentation and damage effects, was used here to study small mass impact on laminated composite plates. By comparing with results from the Hertzian contact law, it was found that damage can change the dynamic response of the structure significantly with increasing impact velocity. Due to smaller contact force generated for the case of using elasto-plastic contact, the central displacement of the plate is also less than the one using Hertzian contact law. The linearized version of the contact law was then used to derive the closed-form approximations of the contact force, indentation and plate central displacement for the impact loading of composite laminates. The threshold velocity for delamination onset under small mass impact was predicted analytically based on the obtained peak contact forces by combining with an existing quasi-static delamination threshold load criterion. A good agreement was found between the predicted threshold values and published experimental results. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A linear split growth model was successfully used to predict the split growth in spectrum fatigue using the corresponding data under constant-amplitude fatigue. However, a linear degradation assumption was found to be inappropriate as it overpredicted lifetime under spectrum fatigue. The residual compressive strength did not show any sign of gradual reduction. The damage mode near the hole changed from longitudinal splitting to transverse extension of fiber failure and delamination as the fatigue stress increased. Thus, while the longitudinal split may serve as a measure of damage in high-cycle fatigue, the extent of transverse fiber failure is a better indication of residual compressive strength. It was shown that a compression-dominated fatigue loading spectrum could be shortened substantially by omitting the two lowest load levels at which no significant damage growth was seen under constant-amplitude fatigue. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This range of changes is observed for loading in compression, tension, bending or shear. Softening and strengthening mechanisms are proposed to account for the changes in properties due to stitching.

The three-dimensional finite element model successfully captured the damage growth behavior for two of the lay-ups ([Ti/0/90/02]s and [Ti/90/0/902]s) in the experimental program. However, in a third lay-up, [Ti/0/90/??30]s, the underlying damage modes were found to be sufficiently different than the other two lay-ups and the model did not capture the steady-state growth behavior. The effects of temperature and specimen size were also investigated for TiGr laminates. Except for the effects of the load ratio, elevated temperatures did not affect the crack growth rate significantly. For wider specimens, the steady-state fatigue crack growth behavior was similar to the narrow specimens, indicating that the steady-state facesheet crack growth behavior is independent of specimen size. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Puck criterion for 3D stress states is adopted to model the intralaminar damage including matrix cracking and fiber breakage, and to obtain the orientation of the fracture plane due to matrix failure. According to interlaminar delamination mechanism, a new delamination criterion is proposed. The influence of transverse and through-thickness normal stress, interlaminar shear stress and damage conditions of adjacent plies on delamination is considered. In order to quickly and efficiently predict the impact-induced damage of composite laminates with more plies, an approach, which can predict the specific damage of several plies in a single solid element, is proposed by interpolation on the strains of element integration points. Moreover, the proposed model can predict specific failure modes.

First, benchmark results to assess delamination propagation capabilities under static loading were created using models simulating specimens with different delamination lengths. For each delamination length modeled, the load and displacement at the load point were monitored. The mixed-mode strain energy release rate components were calculated along the delamination front across the width of the specimen. A failure index was calculated by correlating the results with the mixed-mode failure criterion of the graphite/epoxy material. The calculated critical loads and critical displacements for delamination onset for each delamination length modeled were used as a benchmark. The load/displacement relationship computed during automatic propagation should closely match the benchmark case. Second, starting from an initially straight front, the delamination was allowed to propagate based on the algorithms implemented in the commercial finite element software. The load-displacement relationship obtained from the propagation analysis results and the benchmark results were compared. Good agreements could be achieved by selecting the appropriate input parameters, which were determined in an iterative procedure.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, a modified adaptive cohesive element is presented. The new elements are developed and implemented in LS-DYNA, as a user defined material subroutine (UMAT), to stabilize the finite element simulations of delamination propagation in composite laminates under transverse loads. In this model, a pre-softening zone is proposed ahead of the existing softening zone. In this pre-softening zone, the initial stiffness and the interface strength are gradually decreased. The onset displacement corresponding to the onset damage is not changed in the proposed model. In addition, the critical energy release rate of the materials is kept constant. Moreover, the constitutive equation of the new cohesive model is developed to be dependent on the opening velocity of the displacement jump. The traction based model includes a cohesive zone viscosity parameter (η) to vary the degree of rate dependence and to adjust the maximum traction. The numerical simulation results of DCB in Mode-I is presented to illustrate the validity of the new model. It is shown that the proposed model brings stable simulations, overcoming the numerical instability and can be widely used in quasi-static, dynamic and impact problems. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Delamination failure of composite vessels subjected to internal blast loading was studied in this paper. Experiments were conducted on several e-glass/epoxy vessels with aluminum lining. Micro observation and fracture analysis indicated that delamination failure occurred under a wide range of explosive loadings. A finite element model was also established to explore the delamination initiation mechanism and the evolution of dynamic behavior. Delamination simulation was achieved using a tiebreak contact model and a cohesive criterion. Numerical results from the finite element analysis were compared with experimental data, which indicated that both dynamic response and delamination failure are in good agreement. An analysis of dynamic response highlighted the amplitude and phase inconsistency between neighbor layers during the vibration process, which is considered the main cause of delamination failure. The dynamic behavior evolution of delamination under different explosive loading conditions was investigated by setting a small pre-delamination in the numerical model. Results showed that the pre-delamination ignited continuous delamination in different scales of length. With the increment of explosive charge, pre-delamination extended more rapidly with many new delamination appearing and several delamination fusing with the bigger one during the extension.",

          "abstract": "The effect of transverse shear on delamination in layered, isotropic, linear-elastic materials has been determined. In contrast to the effects of an axial load or a bending moment on the energy-release rate for delamination, the effects of shear depend on the details of the deformation in the crack-tip region. It therefore does not appear to be possible to deduce rigorous expressions for the shear component of the energy-release rate based on steady-state energy arguments or on any type of modified beam theory. The expressions for the shear component of the energy-release rate presented in this work have been obtained using finite-element approaches. By combining these results with earlier expressions for the bending-moment and axial-force components of the energy-release rates, the framework for analyzing delamination in this type of geometry has been extended to the completely general case of any arbitrary loading. The relationship between the effects of shear and other fracture phenomena such as crack-tip rotations, elastic foundations and cohesive zones are discussed in the final sections of this paper. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A contact factor is defined to characterize the contact effect and determined using the micro-mechanics of composite material. By analyzing the kinematics of nonlinear deformation at the interfaces of the delamination, the contact force is derived. Asymptotic solutions from perturbation analysis are presented. It is found that the deformation of the laminate involves a global deflection and a local buckling. The anti-penetrating contact effects are characterized by the local buckling and are intrinsic properties of the laminates, relying only on the geometries of the delamination and the material properties.

          "abstract": "Composites have recently gained considerable acceptance in the transportation sector such as the aerospace and automotive industries, as these materials offer the ability to reduce weight, greenhouse gas emissions and associated fuel cost. Conversely, problems related to material behavior, cost, manufacturing process, assembly and choice of joining technique pose challenges that limit the wide acceptance and implementation of the composite materials. Specifically, a major problem related to joining is the use of mechanical/fastener joints with drilled holes that can damage the continuous fibers and cause considerable reduction in the load carrying capacity of resulting composite structures.To address this issue, an innovative solution that manufactures fabric laminates using &#039;tailored placement&#039; of fibers around the holes/notch was proposed. This eliminates the need for drilling and machining of holes thereby eliminating the sources of delamination. The tensile performance of notched composites from the novel tailored fiber placement (TFP) approach was compared to conventional notched composites. Additionally, the effect of various fiber placement patterns and machining processes on the strength, damage initiation and fracture mode of notched composite laminates were studied. Specifically, the stress and strain fields around the notch were thoroughly evaluated. The experimental results for notched specimens were compared with the damage initiation and strength predictions obtained from the Hashin failure criteria as available in commercially available FEA package (ABAQUS??). A good agreement between experimental results and numerical predictions was observed. Overall, the proposed approach shows great promise in the use of tailored fiber placement technique to eliminate delaminations, maintain continuous fiber alignments and reduce associated stress concentrations in a wide range of composite applications including but not limited to mechanical fastening.",

It explains graphs showing the theoretical predictions for failure envelopes and stress/strain diagrams of the 14 test cases. The successive failure of different laminates subjected to a variety of loading conditions is treated by a layer-by-layer failure analysis. Three sources of nonlinearity are considered-namely, material nonlinearity because of micro damage, matrix cracking, and changes in fiber angle with increasing strains. There is good agreement between predictions and experimental results. Some disagreement is because of imperfections in certain tests; therefore, these tests should be repeated. Three categories of laminate configuration/loading condition can be distinguished: (I) laminates with 3 or more fiber directions with arbitrary loading conditions; (II) balanced angle ply laminates with stress ratios in accordance with netting analysis; and (III) laminates with 2 fiber directions and loadings, which are not in accordance with netting analysis. The analysis of category (I) is straight forward. Category (II) is sensitive to the stiffness degradation after the onset of matrix cracking. Category (III) fails at low stresses and large strains of the laminate, because of a rapid deterioration. To define a failure limit for category (III), an intensive discussion is necessary. For the detection of the different modes (A, B, C) of inter-fiber fracture (IFF), refined action plane related IFF-criteria developed by Puck on the basis of Mohr&#039;s and Hashin&#039;s considerations on brittle fracture are explained.",

Tensile tests were also performed on the unreinforced resin. Displacement rates varying between 0.1 and 100 mm min were applied, and testing temperatures were varied between 23 and 170 ??C. Fracture data reduction was achieved by means of time-temperature superposition, the shift factors being obtained from tensile tests. The toughness of PEI, by contrast with that of other thermoplastic polymers commonly used as matrices for composite materials (e.g. PEEK), showed a non-monotonic, but still moderate, sensitivity to the test conditions explored here. Interlaminar toughness of the corresponding composite increased steadily with crack speed and was always lower than that of the plain resin. This result indicates that the interlaminar structure of the composite material is not optimised as regards this particular property. ?? 1995.",

Then, another methodology is introduced using two kinds of embedded optical fiber sensors to detect and monitor the transverse crack evolution in composite laminates. One is plastic optical fibers (POF), where the loss in optical power is generated by local deformation of POF due to transverse cracking. The other is fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, where the local strain distribution within the FBG gage length due to transverse cracking alters the power spectrum of the light reflected from the FBG sensors.

D ratio, metal volume fraction, fiber volume fraction, and fiber orientation. Experimental results show that with the same joint geometry and metal volume fraction, the commingling of boron fibers improves the bearing strength of fiber/metal laminates. Observations show the boron/glass fiber prepreg, transverse to the loading direction, results in a bearing mechanism that effectively increases the bearing strength. The bearing strength of COBRA with longitudinal fibers is lower than that with transverse fibers due to the fact that shearout failure takes place before maximum bearing strength is reached. The experimental results show that, with only either transverse fiber orientation or longitudinal fiber orientation, COBRA with 18% boron fiber volume fraction possesses a higher bearing strength when compared to HFML with 6% boron fiber volume fraction.

          "abstract": "Delamination is a frequent and potentially serious damage that can occur in laminated polymer composites due to the poor inter-laminar fracture toughness of the matrix. Vibration based detection methods employ changes caused by loss of stiffness in dynamic parameters such as frequencies to detect and assess damage. One of the challenges of using frequency shift for damage detection is that while the presence of damage is easily identified through a shift in measured frequency, the determination of the location and the severity of the damage are not easy to accomplish. To determine the location and severity of damage from measured changes in frequency, it is necessary to solve the inverse problem, which requires the solution of a set of non-linear simultaneous equations. In this paper, we examine three different inverse algorithms for solving the non-linear equations to predict the interface, lengthwise location and size of delamination: direct of solution using a graphical method, artificial neural network (ANN) and surrogate-based optimization. The three inverse algorithms have been validated using numerical data generated from the finite element model (FEM) of delaminated beams and measured frequencies from modal testing conducted on simply supported and cantilever carbon fiber reinforced beam specimens. Results show that all three algorithms can predict the delamination parameters accurately using the validation data directly generated from FE model. However, if using experimental data from real beams, ANN does not fare as well as the other two methods as it is more sensitive to the measurement errors. Finally, the advantages and limitations of each method have been summarized to provide a useful guide for selecting inverse algorithms for vibration-based delamination detection. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Using advanced manufacturing techniques it is possible to create laminates, composed of plies with spatially varying fiber orientation, which have stiffness properties that vary as a function of position. Previous work had modeled such variable stiffness laminae by taking a reference fiber path and creating subsequent paths by shifting the reference path. This paper introduces a method where subsequent paths are truly parallel to the reference fiber path. The primary manufacturing constraint considered in the analysis of variable stiffness laminates was limits on fiber curvature which proved to be more restrictive for parallel fiber laminae than for shifted fiber. The in-plane responses of shifted and parallel fiber variable stiffness laminates to applied uniform end shortening were determined. Both shifted and parallel fiber variable stiffness laminates can redistribute the applied load thereby increasing critical buckling loads compared to traditional straight fiber laminates. The primary differences between the two methods is that parallel fiber laminates are not able to redistribute the loading to the degree of the shifted fiber. This significantly reduces the increase in critical buckling load for parallel fiber variable stiffness laminates over straight fiber laminates.",

A number of damage mechanisms induced in two sets of circular coupon specimens have shown to be of both local and global effects. It is demonstrated that damage force and incident kinetic energy (IKE) maps can be used to identify damage initiation. However, the use of IKE and damage area for assessing damage tolerance has limitations, in particular for thick laminates, so that the use of impact force can be an additional damage measure. It is found that delamination or multiple delamination degrading local flexural stiffness causes impacted panels to fail in compression with kink-band shear at a load level that is significantly lower than that of unimpacted panels. But when the impacted panels are completely delaminated, they can still retain 30% strengths for the glass-polyester and 20% strengths for the glass-phenolic laminates if they are under subsequent compressive loading.

The onset and growth of delamination in AS4/PEEK, a tough thermoplastic matrix composite, was characterized for mode 1 and mode 2 loadings, using the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and the End Notched Flexure (ENF) test specimens. Delamination growth per fatigue cycle, da/dN, was related to strain energy release rate, G, by means of a power law. However, the exponents of these power laws were too large for them to be adequately used as a life prediction tool. A small error in the estimated applied loads could lead to large errors in the delamination growth rates. Hence strain energy release rate thresholds, G sub th, below which no delamination would occur were also measured. Mode 1 and 2 threshold G values for no delamination growth were found by monitoring the number of cycles to delamination onset in the DCB and ENF specimens. The maximum applied G for which no delamination growth had occurred until at least 1,000,000 cycles was considered the threshold strain energy release rate. Comments are given on how testing effects, facial interference or delamination front damage, may invalidate the experimental determination of the constants in the expression.",

          "abstract": "We present a three-dimensional (3-D) stress analysis for composite laminates with an elastically pinned circular hole. The effects of friction, bearing force and bypass loading on the stress redistribution are studied in detail. The numerical approach is based on a multilayer boundary element method (MLBEM), a non-traditional BEM particularly designed for anisotropic composite laminates, coupled with the traditional BEM for the pin filling the hole. The unique characteristic of the MLBEM is that the fundamental solution employs Green&#039;s functions that satisfy the interfacial continuity conditions and top- and bottom- surface traction-free and symmetry conditions. This fundamental solution allows us to design a BE scheme without involving discretization on the interfaces and surfaces unless the laminates are imposed by different boundary conditions. Consequently, in this case of pinned joint, only the hole surface among the composite boundary and interfaces needs to be discretized. A Coulomb-type friction law is used to simulate the frictional contact interaction between the composite and pin. To solve the frictional contact problem, an iterative scheme of successive over-relaxation has been proposed where the contact location and frictional contact condition are determined at the same time in the iteration solution. By applying the MLBEM, stress analyses are performed for a laminate plate with the stacking sequence (0/???45/90)s. The issues of engineering interests, such as the loading-sequence and cycling dependencies of stress state due to the presence of friction, are addressed. The solutions, shown by complicated contact maps and stress states around the hole, suggested that a 3-D approach to pinned composite joints is necessary for the interpretation of the underlying physics. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

A methodology is proposed for predict ing the evolution of residual stress development during the curing process. A one- dimensional cure simulation analysis is coupled to an incremental laminated plate theory model to study the relationships between complex gradients in temperature and degree of cure, and process-induced residual stress and deformation. Material models are proposed to describe the mechanical properties, thermal and chemical strains of the thermoset resin during cure. These material models are incorporated into a micromechanics model to pre dict the effective mechanical properties and process-induced strains of the composite dur ing cure. Thermal expansion and cure shrinkage contribute to changes in material specific volume and represent important sources of internal loading included in the analysis. Tem perature and degree of cure gradients that develop during the curing process represent fun damental mechanisms that contribute to stress development not considered in traditional residual stress analyses of laminated composites. Model predictions of cure dependent epoxy modulus and curvature in unsymmetric graphite/epoxy laminates are correlated with experimental data. The effects of processing history (autoclave temperature cure cy cle), laminate thickness, resin cure shrinkage and laminate stacking sequence on the evo lution of process-induced stress and deformation in thick-section glass/polyester and graphite/epoxy laminates during cure are studied. The magnitude of process-induced residual stress is sufficient to mitiate transverse cracks and delammations.

The fire retarding performance of the laminates was evaluated with cone calorimeter tests with an external radiated heat flux of 50 kW / m2. The test results indicated that there was significant improvement in the fire retardancy of composite laminates due to the incorporation of CNS. It was found that the CNS plies survived the test except the one on the top surface of the laminates. The formation of compact char materials was observed on the surface of the CNS residues. The improvement in fire retarding performance was achieved through the barrier and insulator effects of the CNS and charred materials by restricting the migration of flammable products to the top surface of the laminates and preventing the transmission of external heat to the underlying polyester resin. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

The quality of the developed multiscale laminates was evaluated by non-destructive inspection techniques (ultrasonic C-scan and thermography), density measurements as well as optical and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The in-plane and transverse thermal and electrical conductivities as well as Short-Beam-Shear (SBS) strength were measured at different locations within each composite panel. It was found that the addition of SWCNT can have a considerable influence on the porosity of manufactured laminates. In summary, while unwrapped SWCNT generally improved the thermal and electrical properties of the PEEK/GF laminates, composites incorporating compatibilizer exhibited the lowest porosity, the highest electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

And there is a correlative relation between the two distributions. With the study of statistical relationship between the fatigue loading and the fatigue life in the uniform confidence level and the same survival rate S-N curves of material, the relationship between the static strength distribution and the fatigue life distribution through a material S-N curve model has been obtained. And then the model which is used to describe the distributions of fatigue life of composites, based on their distributions of static strength, is set up. This model reasonably reflects the effects of the inner original defects on the static strength dispersion and on the fatigue life dispersion of composite laminates. The experimental data of three kinds of composite laminates are employed to verify this model, and the results show that this model can predict the random distributions of fatigue life for composites under any fatigue loads fairly well.",

          "abstract": "Hybrid Titanium Composite Laminates (HTCL) are a type of hybrid composite laminate with promise for high-speed aerospace applications, specifically designed for improved damage tolerance and strength at high-temperature (350??F, 177??C). However, in previous testing, HTCL demonstrated a propensity to excessive delamination at the titanium/PMC interface following titanium cracking. An advanced HTCL has been constructed with an emphasis on strengthening this interface, combining a PETI-5/IM7 PMC with Ti-15-3 foils prepared with an alkaline-perborate surface treatment. This paper discusses how the fatigue capabilities of the &#039;advanced&#039; HTCL compare to the first generation HTCL which was not modified for interface optimization, in both tension-tension (R=0.1) and tension-compression (R=-0.2). The advanced HTCL did not demonstrate a significant improvement in fatigue life, in either tension-tension or tension-compression loading. However, the advanced HTCL proved much more damage tolerant. The R=0.1 tests revealed that the advanced HTCL increased the fatigue life following initial titanium ply damage up to 10?? that of the initial HTCL at certain stress levels. The damage progression following the initial ply damage demonstrated the effect of the strengthened PMC/titanium interface. Acetate film replication of the advanced HTCL edges showed a propensity for some fibers in the adjacent PMC layers to fail at the point of titanium crack formation, suppressing delamination at the Ti/PMC interface. The inspection of failure surfaces validated these findings, revealing PMC fibers bonded to the majority of the titanium surfaces. Tension compression fatigue (R=-0.2) demonstrated the same trends in cycles between initial damage and failure, damage progression, and failure surfaces. Moreover, in possessing a higher resistance to delamination, the advanced HTCL did not exhibit buckling following initial titanium ply cracking under compression unlike the initial HTCL. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The nonlinear shear behaviour of the composite was described by the Soutis shear stress-strain semi-empirical formula. The finite element (FE) method was employed to simulate the behaviour of the composite under low velocity impact. Interface cohesive elements were inserted between plies with appropriate mixed-mode damage laws to model delamination. The damage model was implemented in the FE code (Abaqus/Explicit) by a user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT). Numerical results in general gave a good agreement when compared to experimentally obtained curves of impact force and absorbed energy versus time. The various damage mechanisms introduced during the impact event were observed by non-destructive technique (NDT) X-ray radiography and were successfully captured numerically by the proposed damage evolution model. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The outside diameters of the cladding and polyimide coating are 40 and 52 μm, respectively. First, a brief summary is presented for applications of small-diameter FBG sensors to damage monitoring in composite structures. Then, we propose a new damage detection system for quantitative evaluation of delamination length in CFRP laminates using Lamb wave sensing. In this system, a piezo-ceramic actuator generates Lamb waves in a CFRP laminate. After the waves propagate in the laminate, transmitted waves are received by an FBG sensor attached on or embedded in the laminate using a newly developed high-speed optical wavelength interrogation system. This system was applied to detect interlaminar delamination in CFRP cross-ply laminates. When the Lamb waves passed through the delamination, the amplitude decreased and a new wave mode appeared. These phenomena could be well simulated using a finite element analysis. From the changes in the amplitude ratio and the arrival time of the new mode depending on the delamination length, it was found that this system could evaluate the delamination length quantitatively. Furthermore, small-diameter FBG sensors were embedded in a double-lap type coupon specimen, and the debonding progress could be evaluated using the wavelet transform.",

These properties make CFRP suitable for use in structural components for aerospace applications. Drilling is the most common machining process applied to CFRP laminates, and it is difficult due to the extremely abrasive nature of the carbon fibers and low thermal conductivity of CFRP. It is a challenge for manufacturers to drill CFRP materials without causing any delamination on the work part while also considering the economics of the process. The subject of this study is the drilling of fabric woven type CFRP laminates which are known to be more resistant to delamination than unidirectional type CFRP laminates. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of double point angle drill geometry on drilling performance through an experimental approach. An uncoated carbide and two diamond coated carbide drills with different drill tip angles are employed in drilling experiments of aerospace quality thick fabric woven CFRP laminates. Force and torque measurements are used to investigate appropriate drilling conditions based on drill geometry and ideal drilling parameters are determined. Tool life tests of the drills were conducted and the condition of the diamond coating is examined as a function of drilling operational parameters. High feed rate drilling experiments are observed to be favorable in terms of drill wear. Feed is observed to be more important than speed, and the upper limit of feed is dictated by the drill design and the rigidity of the machine drill. Hole diameter variation due to drill wear is monitored to determine drill life. At high feeds, hole diameter tolerance is observed to be more critical than hole exit delamination during drilling of fabric woven CFRP laminates. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

          "abstract": "This paper identifies the material and processing parameters which most significantly influence the development of in-plane waviness in laminates. Thin laminates of unidirectional, T300 carbon-fiber/polysulfone matrix prepreg were processed in an autoclave and a custom-made water-cooled chamber, which allowed fast cooling rates. Multivariate regression analysis of process-induced waviness was performed for combinations of the select process variables and their interactions to identify those factors responsible for waviness development. Of the eight parameters investigated - hold temperature, hold time, pressure, length, width, thickness, cooling rate, and tool plate material - only three affected the development of fiber waviness: length, cooling rate, and tool plate material. Length affects not only the number of wrinkles and wrinkle distribution, but also the average amplitude of the waviness. Cooling rate affects the wavelength and amplitude of the waviness, as well as the number of wrinkles. Tool plate material primarily affects the number of wrinkles, without showing a significant effect on the average wave geometry. There is also an interaction between tool plate material and cooling rate in producing fiber waviness. For the three relevant parameters, the possible waviness-inducing mechanisms are tool plate/part coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch, temporal temperature gradients (or cooling rates), and spatial temperature gradients. The tool plate/part CTE mismatch proved to be the most important mechanism driving fiber waviness in plates, although changes in cooling rates also dramatically affected the quantity of waviness which developed. Spatial temperature gradients were negligible for this study. The tool plate/part CTE mismatch-driven axial buckling loads on the fibers were substantial in the outermost laminate plies, or skin, but negligible in the laminate core. Waviness was limited to the surface or skin plies, even in identically-processed thick laminates. This study confirmed that if the fibers experience axial loads - albeit a small fraction of their Young&#039;s modulus - while the matrix is unable to provide some level of transverse fiber support, the fibers will microbuckle resulting in waviness (in-plane or out-of-plane depending upon the laminate constraint).",

Different loading options (e.g. same stress and same force), layers of CFRP sheets, and lay-ups of laminates (single and double sides) were considered. A series of experimental tests were performed to determine the effectiveness of the CFRP bonding on prolonging fatigue crack initiation life, preventing fatigue crack propagation and extending fatigue life of the hybrid laminates. Three distinct failure modes, classified as delamination, delamination bending and fiber breakage, were observed in the tests. It is shown that the loading conditions and CFRP thickness are the critical parameters affecting the failure modes and fatigue resistance. The crack initiation life and fatigue life of fiber-metal laminates (FMLs) increase by factors ranging from 1.06 to 1.96 and 1.17 to 2.07, respectively, relative to monolithic steel plates under the same force condition; whereas decrease by factors ranging from 0.63 to 0.89 and 0.28 to 0.61 under the same stress condition. Moreover, the double-side bonded FMLs show better fatigue properties and more stable crack propagation than single-side counterpart with the same thickness of CFRP.",

          "abstract": "The characterisation of the damage state of composite structures is often performed using the acoustic behaviour of the composite system. This behaviour is expected to change significantly as the damage is accumulating in the composite. It is indisputable that different damage mechanisms are activated within the composite laminate during loading scenario. These “damage entities” are acting in different space and time scales within the service life of the structure and may be interdependent. It has been argued that different damage mechanisms attribute distinct acoustic behaviour to the composite system. Loading of cross-ply laminates in particular leads to the accumulation of distinct damage mechanisms, such as matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fibre rupture at the final stage of loading. As highlighted in this work, the acoustic emission activity is directly linked to the structural health state of the laminate. At the same time, significant changes on the wave propagation characteristics are reported and correlated to damage accumulation in the composite laminate. In the case of cross ply laminates, experimental tests and numerical simulations indicate that, typical to the presence of transverse cracking and/or delamination, is the increase of the pulse velocity and the transmission efficiency of a propagated ultrasonic wave, an indication that the intact longitudinal plies act as wave guides, as the transverse ply deteriorates. Further to transverse cracking and delamination, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing the catastrophic failure of the composite and is expected to be directly linked to the acoustic behaviour of the composite, as the stiffness loss results to the velocity decrease of the propagated wave. In view of the above, the scope of the current work is to assess the efficiency of acoustic emission and ultrasonic transmission as a combined methodology for the assessment of the introduced damage and furthermore as a structural health monitoring tool.",

The experiments have been performed in two distinct phases. During the first phase typical aerospace materials such as thermoset and thermoplastic CFRP thin laminates and sandwich were inspected, in order to validate the ultrasonic NDI system and the original test methodology. Then, in the second phase, tests have been performed on glass fiber and polyester resin systems, where the fiber was in the form of woven fabric or woven roving, and Kevlar and polyester resin system, where the Kevlar is in the form of woven fabric. All the specimens are made by RTM technology and the thickness are comprised between 5 and 6 mm. Moreover, the NDI analysis was performed using two different probes (5 and 15 MHz), in order to evaluate the importance of the probe frequency for the reliable evaluation of delaminations on composite materials.

In general, environmental degradation is observed as matrix cracking and erosion that leads to deterioration of matrix-dominated properties. In this work, cross-ply laminates of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy were subjected to environmental degradation using controlled ultraviolet radiation (UV) and moisture condensation and the post-exposure mechanical properties were evaluated through elastic modulus and failure strength measurements. Additionally, both degraded and undegraded were subjected to cyclic fatigue loading to investigate possible synergistic effects between environmental degradation and mechanical fatigue. Experimental results show that the degradation results in reduced failure strength. Greater effects of degradation are observed when the materials are tested under flexural as opposed to uniaxial loading. Based on strength measurements and scanning electron microscopy, we identified various damage modes resulting from exposure to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and cyclic loading. The principal mechanisms that lead to reduction in mechanical properties are the loss of fiber confinement due to matrix erosion, due to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and weakened/ cracked ply interfaces due to mechanical fatigue. An empirical relationship was established to quantify the specific influence of different damage mechanisms and to clarify the effects of various degradation conditions.",

This approach, pioneered by Hashin, applies the principle of minimum complementary energy to describe the stress state in a cross-ply laminate with transverse cracks. Apart from material data, only laminate geometry data and stress distribution assumptions are required. The model developed in the present study contains stress distribution assumptions that are closer to reality than previous models. Non-uniform stress distributions are included through-the-thickness of both the 0°- and the 90°-layers. An important result is the improved agreement with stiffness reduction data. As expected from the nature of the model, predictions generally provide lower bounds to the stiffness of the cracked laminate. However, at high crack densities, this is not the case. This additional stiffness reduction at high crack densities indicates the presence of new damage types, such as branched cracks and local delamination.",

A spraying methodology was used to deposit the f-CNTs on the midplane carbon fabric to produce this through-thickness interlaminar reinforcement. The four-point end notch flexure (4ENF) specimen was used in the experiments to calculate the critical strain energy release rate, GIIc, to quantify a value for fracture toughness. Compared to the neat case (0.0 wt% CNTs) there was a 23% increase in the average initiation and 27% increase in the average propagation GIIc with only 0.5 wt% f-CNTs dispersed on the fabric and in the resin of the midplane region. High resolution microscopic examinations of the specimen fracture surfaces suggest that the functionalized carbon nanotubes are covalent bonding nanoscale tethers between the fibers and the epoxy resin, resulting in toughened fiber-matrix interfacial strengths to achieve these improved through-thickness mechanical properties for this nanocomposite laminate system.

Actually, delamination is an important failure mode and affected, for example, by fiber orientation and stacking sequence as discussed. In analysis, our developed mathematical model yields the interlaminar edge stresses and singularities around the hole to predict the onset of delamination. Furthermore, our work mainly aims to investigate experimentally the initiation and propagation of delamination subjected to tension and cyclic tension-tension (T-T) tests in centrally notched T300/5208 graphite/epoxy composite laminates, including four layups: (a) orthotropic [+/-45]4s, [90/0]4s and (b) quasi-isotropic [0/90/+/-45]2s, [90/0/+/-45]2s. Experimental result and observation associated with the obtained maximum stresses and the adopted failure criterion are in good agreement with our predicted delamination onset. Other important findings are highlighted as follows. The failure mode of each layup recorded by X-ray radiograph can be closely correlated to the prediction of our model. The delamination growth rate has also been measured. An approximately linear relationship between delamination area and stiffness reduction for the centrally notched quasi-isotropic laminates is established. The critical load for delamination can be estimated by the Hashin-Rotem failure criterion satisfactorily. As a benefit of nondestructive testing, we finally find that the residual strength of the laminate first increases as applied cycles increase and then decreases during fatigue tests. However, residual stiffness always decreases monotonically with the increase of applied cycles.",

The study is related to application of carbon fiber composites in airframe structures. In this paper, FEM 3D analysis for modeling and predicting the damage in carbon-epoxy laminate subjected to low velocity impact were performed. The model of finite elements assuming the interlamiar shear stresses continuity between different oriented layers is presented. Two different laminates were evaluated employing VUMAT redeveloped ABAQUS. The occurrence of matrix failure and the delaminated areas were predicted by using the failure criteria based on empirical relation and other developed criteria.

A good agreement between analysis and experimental results for the mode and orientation of delaminations were obtained.

The results of single delamination in unidirectional laminates under pure mode I, mode II, and mixed mode I/II correspond well with the analytical solutions. The results of multiple delaminations in unidirectional laminates are in good agreement with experimental data.

Some major cause of property variability in hand lay-up laminates are studied. Tensile strength properties of the impor t ant reinforcing fibers—glass, graphite, aramid, and boron—are reviewed. Filament, yarn, and resin-impregnated strand test methods are discussed. Tensile strength theories for untwisted yarns (fiber bundles) and strands are summarized. A new theory for twisted fibrous structures, such as yarns and ropes, is presented. Predictions of the various theories are compared with test da ta for Kevlar®^ 49 a r amid. Standard flexural test procedures presented in ASTM Tests for Flexural Properties of Plastics and Electrical Insulating Materials (D 790) are reviewed, and it is shown analytically and experimentally that use of the shorter recommended span-todepth ratios can give artificially low modulus values. The importance of considering characteristic dimensions of material internal structure in selection of test coupon geometry, a topic ignored in most test methods, is discussed. This criterion is particularly important for fabric composites because yarn bundle size, an important characteristic dimension, can be large. The effects on mechanical properties of two types of common nonuniformities found in hand lay-up fabric laminates—resin surface layers and unequal layer thickness—are examined and found to be very significant. Finally, it is shown that there is an appa r ent effect of number of plies on flexural modulus which can be significantly reduced by modifying test da ta to account for resin surface layer.",

High performance FRPs are often subjected to dynamic loadings of different energy densities in their service life when strain rate, stress triaxiality, temperature, and mode of fracture can have a significant knock-down effect on the interfacial strength of plies in a laminate. This paper develops a predictive tool, in a continuum damage mechanics (CDM) framework, to assess delamination damage in FRPs under dynamic loading; the model takes into account the effects of dynamic energy density, mixed-mode fractures and temperature. The CDM model is formulated based on the fracture mechanics (FM) of decohesion and an advantage of the proposed model is that nearly all of the material parameters can be obtained directly through calibration to experimental data rather than numerical curve fitting of simulation results. The developed scheme is coded into a commercial FEA package (ABAQUS) through user-defined subroutines and the fidelity of the model is assessed by comparison with existing experimental data in the literature. The validated model is used to investigate delamination damage in a laminated FRP subject to projectile impact loading, where it will be shown that the extent of delamination damage through the thickness of the FRP structure is dependent upon different wave propagation scenarios. The proposed model provides a design platform for damage assessment caused by dynamic delamination and may be a useful tool for designing FRP composites with a greater impact tolerance.",

Stiffness loss was measured experimentally to account for the accumulation of matrix cracks and for delimination growth. Fatigue failure was predicted by comparing the increase in global strain resulting from stiffness loss to the decrease in laminate failure strain resulting from delaminations forming at matrix cracks through the laminate thickness. Good agreement between measured and predicted lives indicated that the through-thickness damage accumulation model can accurately describe fatigue failure for laminates where the delamination onset behaviour in fatigue is well characterized, and stiffness loss can be monitored in real time to account for damage growth. ?? 1989.",

They can easily be placed in resin rich interlayers between reinforcing plies prior to laminate production and require no dispersion into the matrix resin. Although there are many expected benefits, the research on composite laminates enhanced with electrospun thermoplastic nanofibres is still very limited and a thorough understanding of the toughening mechanism is still missing. This article provides thorough insights into the micromechanisms that lead to the interlaminar toughening of carbon/epoxy composite laminates interleaved with electrospun polyamide nanofibrous veils. The main mechanism leading to a higher interlaminar fracture toughness, both under Mode I and Mode II loading conditions, was the bridging of (micro)cracks by PA nanofibres. The effectiveness of the nanofibre bridging toughening mechanism is dependent on a good load transfer to the nanofibres. Crack propagation under Mode II loading conditions resulted in much higher improvements than under Mode I loading due to an optimal loading of the nanofibres along their fibre direction in the plane of the nanofibrous veil. In Mode I crack propagation, however, the loading of the nanofibres is less optimal and was shown to be dependent on both the primary reinforcement fabric architecture, as well as on the presence of a carbon fibre bridging zone.",

The effects of the shock duration on the wave propagation are key issues of this work. Experiments have been performed on high power laser facilities and on a high power pulsed generator to get a wide range of pulse duration from fs to µs.

The z-pinned composite has been developed to overcome such a problem. In this study, the mechanical properties of z-pinned composite laminates were examined using the analytical model. The effects of z-pins on the strength in the thickness direction were investigated. Fibers in the laminate are gradually waved by the formation of resin rich zone caused by inserting the z-pins. A constitutive model was developed for the predictions of strengths of woven z-pinned composites. The changes in the strengths in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions of the woven z-pinned composites and the effects of controlling parameters such as the diameter of z-pin and densities of z-pin on the strengths were identified. It was found that the out-of-plane tensile strength increases 14% relative to that of composite without z-pins when the diameter of z-pin is 0.25 mm. However, the in-plane tensile strength and in-plane and out-of-plane shear strengths were reduced to 9%, 7% and 8%, respectively, over the strengths of composite without z-pins. Qualitatively good correlations are obtained between the results of the suggested model and the experiments.",

          "abstract": "Due to the singularity nature of delamination, the fundamental concept of fracture mechanics was applied. However, the oscillatory characteristics near the delamination tip prohibited the use of conventional definition assuming the crack embed­ ded into a homogeneous solid. A proper definition for the stress intensity factors and en­ ergy release rates of binuuerial interface cracks was introduced in this paper to study the fracture criterion far delamination. To measure the delamination fracture toughness, the test specimen usually used for the unidirectional composites was redesigned to suit for the cases that the delamination lies between two laminae with different fiber orientations. The test results show that the double cantilever beam (DCB) test is near to pure Mode I and the end-notched flexural (ENF) test is near to pure Mode II. Therefore, like the cracks in homogeneous materials, the test methods DCB and ENF are useful for the measurement of delamination fracture toughness G,c and Guc. Based upon this conclusion, a series of cracked-lap shear (CLS) and modified end-notched flexural (MENF) tests and finite ele­ment simulation are conducted in this paper to establish the mixed-mode delamination fracture criterion. To validate the proposed fracture criterion, two commonly encountered problems are predicted and tested. One is the prediction of the most probable interface for the onset of delamination and its possible minimum load, in which no delamination was embedded prior to loading. The other is the prediction for the test with delamination exist­ ing prior to loading. The results show that the prediction by using this proposed criterion is well matched with the experiment.",

The damage size of FML after impact is considerably smaller than of glass and carbon fibre composite materials.

The treatment of glass fibres with two similar silane coupling agents has been shown to improve the mechanical properties of the composite as a function of the type of coupling agent. γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) and γ-aminobutyltriethoxysilane (ABS) have similar chemistry, but differ in mobility (molecular motion) at the coupling agent-epoxy interface. The critical energy release rate, G 1c, for the APS-treated composites (0.59 ± 0.05 kJ m -2) was shown to be higher than that of the ABS-treated one (0.37 ± 0.01 kJ m -2) and also the untreated one (0.31 ± 0.02 kJ m -2). In this case, the bulk structural property appears to be a function of the microscopic interfacial properties including the dynamics of the coupling agent layer. Optical characterization of the fracture surfaces reveal delamination at the epoxy-glass interface for the untreated samples, while the ABS- and APS-treated samples showed less interfacial delamination, respectively. © 1996 Chapman &amp; Hall.",

The delamination is a major problem associated with the drilling fiber reinforced composite materials, which reduce the structural integrity of the material. The present work focuses on the analysis of delamination behavior as a function of drilling process parameters at the entrance of the CFRP plates. The delamination analysis in high speed drilling is performed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model with spindle speed, feed rate and point angle as the affecting parameters. A multilayer feed forward ANN architecture, trained using error-back propagation training algorithm (EBPTA) is employed for this purpose. Drilling experiments are conducted as per full factorial design using cemented carbide (grade K20) twist drills that serve as input-output patterns for ANN training. The ANN model so developed is validated by presenting training and new testing input patterns. The validated ANN model is then used to generate the direct and interaction effect plots to analyze the delamination behavior. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the ANN models to analyze the effects of drilling process parameters on delamination factor. The analysis also demonstrates the advantage of employing higher speed in controlling the delamination during drilling.",

The worn surfaces were examined with a scanning electron microscope and the friction and wear mechanisms were studied. The results show that after an initial wear-in of the surfaces the coefficient of friction will decrease with increasing number of reciprocal cycles as more load is carried by fiber/fiber and fiber/matrix contacts. The evolution of the coefficient of friction is related to whether the starting surfaces are covered with a matrix layer or if the fibers are visible. Any matrix layer will flow to the sides of the contact region, causing fibers to become visible. More of the load will be carried by fiber/fiber and fiber/matrix contacts and the coefficient of friction will decrease. The effective coefficient of friction depends on the amount of load carried by matrix/matrix, fiber/matrix and fiber/fiber contacts and their respective coefficient of friction. Of the three types of contact, the matrix/matrix contact has the highest coefficient of friction, approximately 0.6. Matrix debris formed at the boundary of the contact regions and no wear of the fibers was observed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

The laminates were manufactured using a fast one step cold press manufacturing procedure. The mechanical behavior of the laminates was then investigated under tensile and fatigue loading conditions. The tensile properties of the plain aluminum, the composite materials, and the thermoplastic fiber-metal laminates (TFML) were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. The fatigue tests were also conducted under load control based on the ASTM E 466 standard procedure. Various loading cycles were employed for the fatigue tests in order to minimize the possibility of heat generation on the composite materials. Three different load levels were applied for the fatigue specimens with zero to max loading. Results have shown that the glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene hybrid systems exhibited higher fatigue strength than the self-reinforced polypropylene based fiber-metal laminates. Following this, a simple prediction method for fatigue life of the TFMLs has been introduced. It is clearly indicated that the stress ranges calculated using the proposed method for the monolithic AL2024-T3 and the TFMLs are very similar at the same cycles to failure.

Initial quasi-static tension tests demonstrated satisfactory correlation between the strains from the FBG sensors and FE predictions.

Meshes were generated for three unique combinations of z-pin diameter and density. A laminated plate theory analysis was performed on several layups to determine the bi-axial stresses in the zero degree plies. These stresses, in turn, were used to determine the magnitude of the relative load steps prescribed in the FLASH analyses. Results indicated that increasing pin density was more detrimental to in-plane compression strength than increasing pin diameter. Compression strengths of lamina without z-pins agreed well with a closed form expression derived by Budiansky and Fleck. FLASH results for lamina with z-pins were consistent with the closed form results, and FLASH results without z-pins, if the initial fiber waviness due to z-pin insertion was added to the fiber waviness in the material to yield a total misalignment. Addition of 10% shear to the compression loading significantly reduced the lamina strength compared to pure compression loading. Addition of 50% shear to the compression indicated shear yielding rather than kink band formation as the likely failure mode. Two different stiffener reinforced skin configurations with z-pins, one quasi-isotropic and one orthotropic, were also analyzed. Six unique loading cases ranging from pure compression to compression plus 50% shear were analyzed assuming material fiber waviness misalignment angles of 0, 1, and 2 degrees. Compression strength decreased with increased shear loading for both configurations, with the quasi-isotropic configuration yielding lower strengths than the orthotropic configuration.",

          "abstract": "Usually polymer matrix laminates are made of individual plies with unidirectional fiber reinforcement laid upon each other with varying fiber orientations with respect to the thickness coordinate. Due to missing fiber reinforcement in the thickness direction, this results in poor through-thickness (out-of-plane) properties of composite laminates. One method to enhance the out-of-plane properties is the stitching of dry semi-finished fiber products in the thickness direction prior to the infusion of the resin. On the other hand, the insertion of stitching yarns in the thickness direction may affect the mechanical properties in the laminate plane such as stiffness and strength. To quantify the effect of structural through-thickness reinforcement in non-crimp fabric carbon fiber/epoxy laminates under uniaxial tension and compression loading an experimental study was carried out which included a systematic variation of the yarn diameter, the stitching pattern and direction as well as the load direction. The results showed a significant effect of the stitching on the in-plane Young&#039;s modulus which was attributed to local displacements of the in-plane fibers and changes in the fiber volume fraction. A finite element based unit-cell model was developed to estimate the elastic constants of structurally stitched non-crimp fabric laminates taking into consideration the yarn diameter, the stitching pattern and direction as well as the load direction. Depending on these parameters, local changes of the fiber volume fraction as well as regions with undisturbed and disturbed fiber orientations within the laminate plies are taken into account. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The LS1 model is extended to the analysis of delamination growth in multilayered plates subjected to cylindrical bending loading. To this end, a general multilayered plate with arbitrary boundary conditions is investigated. By imposing the unilateral contact conditions at delaminated interfaces, analytical LS1 solutions to a general multi-delamination problem are obtained. As application examples, two classical mode I (Double Cantilever) and mode II (End Notched Flexure) delamination tests are investigated. By considering two types of crack resistance curve, the delamination propagation in composite laminates is studied. The LS1 results are found and compared to those of a finite element model. Very good agreements between the results of the two models prove the efficiency and accuracy of the LS1 model for the simulation of delamination propagation in laminates subjected to cylindrical bending. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

FM 300 adhesive layers, manufactured by American Cynamid, were placed at the 30/ 90 interface to study the influence of interleaf on the de lamination characteristics of laminates. Quasi 3-D finite element analysis results indicate that the maximum interlaminar normal stress is lower in the laminate with the interleaf compared to the baseline laminate. Results also indicate that the presence of an interleaf reduces the Mode I component of strain energy release rate at the critical interface. Experimental results indicate that the static delanimation onset stress is greater in the interleafed laminate, but the ultimate failure strength of interleafed laminate is lower. The resistance to delamination growth is greater in the interleafed laminates under quasi-static loading. Under fatigue loading the delamination onset life and growth rate of both baseline and interleafed laminates were found to be frequency dependent. Fractographic analysis of laminates reveals more hackles in interleafed laminates, indicating Mode II dominated failure. It was also noted that the matrix material exhibits greater ductility at lower loading frequencies in laminates with and without the interleaf.",

A Lamb wave-based quantitative identification technique for delamination in CF/EP composite structures was established. Propagation of Lamb waves in a series of composite laminates, individually bearing a delamination, was evaluated using dynamic FEM analyses. Taking advantage of wavelet transform and artificial neural algorithms, an Intelligent Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition (ISPPR) package was developed, by which the spectrographic characteristics of simulated Lamb wave signals in the time-frequency domain were extracted and digitised as Digital Damage Fingerprints (DDF), to construct a Damage Parameters Database (DPD). The DPD was then used offline to train a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) under supervision of an error-backpropagation (BP) algorithm. Assisted by an active online structural health monitoring (AO-SHM) system with an active piezoelectric actuator/sensor network, the proposed methodology was validated online by identifying actual delaminations in CF/EP (T650/F584) quasi-isotropic composite laminates. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Several tests for monitoring the stress wave signals including acoustic emission due to failure modes, such as matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber breakage are performed. A series of impact tests at various impact energies by changing the impact mass and height is performed on the instrumented drop weight impact tester. The wavelet transform (WT) and short time fourier transform (STFT) are used to decompose the piezoelectric sensor signals in this study. Test results show that the particular waveform of sensor signals implying the damage initiation and propagation are detected above the damage initiation impact energy.

          "abstract": "The strain energy release rate, G, in cracked composite test coupons and laminates is usually calculated from global parameters such as applied loads and displacements. The global G docs not necessarily reflect the conditions at the crack tip, e.g. when fibres are bridging the crack. This paper presents a method for the experimental determination of the local strain energy release rate based on the crack opening displacement (COD) and crack shear displacement (CSD) profiles at the crack tip, for the case of mode I and mode II loading of composite laminates. It is shown analytically that the singular region , in terms of displacements, is three times larger behind the crack tip, than the singular region in terms of stresses and strains ahead of it, making tbe technique well suited for the experimental determination of the local G. The local G is determined as follows: load is applied to short Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and End Loaded Split (ELS) specimens using shims and a special loading fix­ ture, respectively. The loaded specimens are placed inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) where a series of micrographs, of the region behind the crack tip, are taken. From the micrographs COD and CSD profiles are generated, from which it can be determined if a square root singularity exists. If a square root singularity exists, the local energy release rate can be calculated from the COD and CSD profiles using orthotropic linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The technique was applied to uni­ directional AS4/3SOI-6 delamination beam specimens. It was found that there is a square root singular­ ity near the crack tip, and that the magnitudes of the measured COD and CSD profiles agree well with analytical LEFM predictions. For the tested DCB specimen, with a laminate thickness of 3.4 mm, it was seen that the singular region, in terms of the displacements, extends to approximately 500 pm behind the crack tip.",

The third step is the modelling of the evolution of the non homogeneous cracked state in the composite with an averaging technique, based on the Laws–Dvorak–Hejazi model, developed on the finite element scale. The fourth step is the modelling of the delamination between plies as a lack of contact set off by a mixed criterion matrix-cracking/interfacial forces.

Different damage mechanisms are active during loading. These mechanisms are acting in different time scales of the service life and are interdependent. Loading of cross-ply laminates leads to the accumulation of matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fiber rupture at the final stage of loading. The acoustic activity of damage may be correlated to the source damage mechanisms. Additionally, damage accumulation has been reported to strongly affect the wave propagation characteristics of the material. In the case of cross ply laminates, an increase of pulse velocity and transmission occurs as the top stiff layer becomes progressively isolated from the rest of the material due to matrix cracking and delaminations. As loading continues, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing an eventual decrease of transmission before the failure of the specimens.

          "abstract": "Damage progress in quasi-isotropic CFRP laminates under tensile fatigue loading is investigated microscopically. The onset and growth of transverse cracks and delaminations are observed by an optical microscope and soft X-ray radiography. To study the effects of toughened interlaminar layers on microscopic damage progress, two material systems are used. One is T800H/3631 CFRP without toughened interlaminar layers. The other is a newly developed CFRP, T800H/3900-2 with toughened interlaminar layers. The toughened interlaminar layers contain tough and fine polyamide particles dispersed in the base epoxy resin. By the edge observation, transverse crack density and delamination ratio are measured as a function of the number of stress cycles. By the X-ray radiography observation, delamination onset and growth in the width direction are detected. It is found that delamination onset and growth are suppressed by the toughened interlaminar layers. Paris law analysis is performed for quantitative characterization of transverse crack multiplication and delamination growth.",

Tests on FMLs, based on 2024-O and 2024-T3 aluminum alloys, were undertaken using a nitrogen gas gun at velocities up to 150 m/s. The failure processes in the FMLs were investigated by examining the samples after impact and by sectioning a number of specimens through the point of impact. The impact response of these multilayered samples was also characterized by measuring the residual out-of-plane displacement of the targets after testing. Energy absorption in the FMLs occurred through gross plastic deformation, membrane stretching and tearing in the aluminum plies, as well as delamination, fiber fracture, and matrix cracking in the composite layers. In the multilayered FMLs, the permanent displacement at the perforation threshold remained roughly constant over a range of target configurations, suggesting that the aluminum layers deform almost independently through a membrane stretching mechanism during the perforation process. The impact resistances of the laminates investigated were compared by determining their specific perforation energies (s.p.e.), where it was shown that s.p.e. of several of laminates was almost three times that of the corresponding aluminum alloy. The perforation resistances of the FMLs as well as those of the plain composite were predicted using the Reid-Wen perforation model. Here good agreement was noted between the model and the experimental data for the range of laminates investigated here.",

The constitutive equation for the composite results from the combination of the constitutive equations of the laminae that, in turn, are obtained from the combination of fibers and matrix. The behavior of each component is simulated by a general elastoplastic anisotropic model. The combination rules obey to the microstructure of the composite. In order to calibrate the general model, the behavior of composites formed by laminae reinforced with unidirectional fibers is studied. Three-dimensional finite element models are used to study the distribution of stresses and strains inside the composite. These finite element models are useful to verify the hypotheses of the proposed composites theory, in a relatively simple way. Comparisons between elastic properties of laminae obtained with the finite elements model, with Mori-Tanaka method, with the model for composite studied and experimental results are included in the paper. Elastic properties of laminates with different stacking sequences and fibers orientations are also obtained. Additionally, application examples showing the non-linear response of laminae and laminates obtained with the calibrated model and comparisons with experimental results are presented. The results show that the calibrated model describes the behavior up to failure of composite laminates. The failure mode of the composite produced by the failure of one or more of its components can be identified. The calibrated model is also able to reproduce complex failure modes that change from the matrix to the fibers depending on the type of stress state. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Laminates in various grouped thickness and ply stacking sequences, [02/902/02], [02/904/02], and a quasi-isotropic laminate [+45/0/-45/90](s) were tested under static and tension-tension fatigue loading. Depending on the stacking sequence of the laminates and the type of loading, various matrix cracking behavior were found. Under static loading, the matrix cracks were mainly close to the specimen edges. A few cracks were found to penetrate the specimen width, even when the load was large enough to break the specimen. However, under fatigue cyclic load, the edge initiated cracks propagated fully across the specimen width. Combined with the fatigue Paris Rule and considering the ply thickness and stacking sequence, the energy release rate method was applied to predict the relations between the loading strain amplitude and fatigue cycles for matrix cracking failure.

Leakage at the end joints of this single-span structure led to substantial moisture and salt infiltration in the bridge superstructure. Presence of efflorescence was observed, and freeze-thaw cracking and concrete delamination at some locations on the beams were noted. Concerns about integrity of the steel reinforcing and overall safety of the bridge were raised. These concerns were heightened by the absence of any documents pertaining to the bridge design, such as rebar size, steel type, concrete strength, and design loads. Thus, a decision was made to strengthen the bridge using bonded FRP-laminates. Load tests were conducted to evaluate effectiveness of the strengthening system and investigate its effect on structural behavior, and tests results were compared with those obtained using classical analysis. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Laminated composites, stitched with varying stitch densities and stitch thread thicknesses, are subjected to low-velocity impact loading at various energy levels. X-ray radiography is used to observe in-plane matrix cracks and overall delamination propagation; whilst ??CT is exploited to examine cross-sectional views showing detailed through-thickness matrix cracks distribution and 3D delamination damage pattern. It is revealed that stitches act as crack initiation sites, due to the presence of weak resin-rich pockets around stitch threads, thus inevitably resulting in densely stitched composites having more stitch-induced matrix cracks upon impact loading. It is also concluded that specimens with higher stitch density and thread thickness are more capable of impeding delamination growth by effectively bridging delamination cracks and arresting crack propagation. ??CT evidently shows that 3D delamination pattern in densely stitched composite is more cylindrical in shape, whereas that of a moderately stitched or unstitched composite is more conical. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model for fabric reinforced composites is applied to model both in-ply damage and delamination failure during impact loading. The CDM model has been implemented in a commercial explicit finite element (FE) code in which a laminate is modelled by stacked shell elements with tied interfaces. Delamination failure is modelled by allowing the interfaces to damage and fracture when a delamination failure energy criterion is reached. The code is applied to predict the response of composite shells subjected to gas gun impact tests by a steel impactor under a range of test conditions. A comparison of structural response and failure modes from numerical simulations and impact tests shows good agreement for the prediction of delamination damage and shell penetration at higher impact energies.",

We found experimentally that both the stiffness and the velocity decreased as the transverse crack density increased. In contrast, the stiffness decreased but the velocity increased as the delamination length increased. We analytically deduced the relationship between the velocity and the crack density from a combination of a shear-lag analysis and the classical plate theory. We also confirmed that the Lamb wave propagated through the 0° layers in the delaminated regions, and formulized the relationship between the velocity and the delamination length. The predicted crack density and delamination length using the measured velocity were in good agreement with the experimental results.

          "abstract": "Tis study examined the effects of wood pulp fiber length (short, medium, and long), and fiber loading (27%, 37%, 47%, and 0% [non-reinforced PP]) with 3% maleic anhydride-graſted polypropylene on the mechanical properties of wood-plastic composites (WPCs). Polypropylene and fibers were compounded into pellets using a counter-rotating twin-screw extruder and test specimens were prepared by injection molding. Te results show that increases in fiber length and fiber loading significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) the mechanical properties of the WPCs (MOE and tensile modulus). Te behavior of the composites against MOR and impact strength varied according to fiber length and loading level. In general, the tensile strength was observed to be the same.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a robust computational model for the response of composite laminates to high intensity transverse dynamic loading emanating from local impact by a projectile and distributed pressure pulse due to a blast. Delaminations are modeled using a cohesive type tie-break interface introduced between sublaminates while intralaminar damage mechanisms within the sublaminates are captured in a smeared manner using a strain-softening plastic-damage model. In the latter case, a nonlocal regularization scheme is used to address the spurious mesh dependency and mesh-orientation problems that occur with all local strain-softening type constitutive models. The results for the predicted damage patterns using the nonlocal approach are encouraging and qualitatively agree with the experimental observations. The predictive performance of the proposed numerical model is assessed through comparisons with available instrumented impact test results on a class of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates. Force-time histories and other derived cross-plots such as the force versus projectile displacement and progression of projectile energy loss as a function of time are compared with available experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the model in capturing the details of the dynamic response. Another case study involving the blast loading of CFRP composite laminates is used to further highlight the capability of the proposed model in simulating the global structural response of composite laminates subjected to distributed pressure pulses. 2009 by ASME.",

          "abstract": "In order to effectively describe the progressively intralaminar and interlam- inar damage for composite laminates, a three dimensional progressive damage model for composite laminates to be used for low-velocity impact is presented. Being applied to three-dimensional (3D) solid elements and cohesive elements, the nonlinear damage model can be used to analyze the dynamic performance of composite structure and its failure be- havior. For the intralaminar damage, as a function of the energy release rate, the damage model in an exponential function can describe progressive development of the damage. For the interlaminar damage, the damage evolution is described by the framework of the continuum mechanics through cohesive elements. Coding the user subroutine VUMAT of the finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit, the model is applied to an example, i.e., carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminates under low-velocity impact. It is shown that the prediction of damage and deformation agrees well with the experimental results.",
