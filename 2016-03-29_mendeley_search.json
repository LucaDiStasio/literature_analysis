          "abstract": "In this paper, a concept of delamination factor Fd (i.e. the ratio of the maximum diameter Dmax in the damage zone to the hole diameter D) is proposed to analyze and compare easily the delamination degree in the drilling of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) composite laminates. Experiments were performed to investigate the variations of cutting forces with or without onset of delamination during the drilling operations. The effects of tool geometry and drilling parameters on cutting force variations in CFRP composite materials drilling were also experimentally examined. The experimental results show that the delamination-free drilling processes may be obtained by the proper selections of tool geometry and drilling parameters. The effects of drilling parameters and tool wear on delamination factor are also presented and discussed. Cutting temperature has long been recognized as an important factor influencing the tool wear rate and tool life. An experimental investigation of flank surface temperatures is also presented in this paper. Experimental results indicated that the flank surface temperatures increase with increasing cutting speed but decreasing feed rate. Optimal cutting conditions are proposed to avoid damage from burning during the drilling processes.",

Tests were conducted under Mode I, Mode II and mixed-mode static and fatigue loading at both ambient conditions and elevated temperature. The results show that the strain energy release rate threshold values for delamination growth under fatigue loading are significantly lower than the critical energy release rates in static tests. At elevated temperature, the threshold values in the fatigue loading were only about 10% of the critical values in the static tests. A fractographic analysis of the delamination growth revealed that the fracture surfaces generated at elevated temperature generally were similar to the fracture surfaces generated at room temperature. Nevertheless, some differences in morphology of the fracture surfaces were observed, and their effect on the static and fatigue delamination growth is discussed in detail. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Delamination tests under three mixed I/II mode ratios were carried out via mixed mode bending test apparatus. Significant R-curve effects on the fatigue crack growth rates and thresholds due to fiber bridging and crack branching were observed, which make the traditional Paris Law unsuitable. In this paper, a formerly developed modified Paris Law with the normalized strain energy release rate as the fracture governing parameter is investigated again. The results from the multidirectional delamination tests fit the modified Paris Law very well, and hence have validated it by experiments. Moreover, the thresholds normalized to delamination resistance were utilized to evaluate the critical fatigue crack growth conditions. By the combination of test data for both 0??/5?? and 90??/90?? laminates, an interface-independent normalized threshold was proposed, which was found linearly decreasing with mode mixture ratios. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

To develop the nanocomposite laminates, a spraying technology was used to deposit nanotubes on both sides of each four-harness satin weave carbon fiber fabric piece for the 12 ply laminate lay up. For these experimental studies the carbon fiber reinforced epoxy laminates were fabricated using a heated vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (H-VARTM®) method followed by a 2 soak curing cycle. The f-CNTs toughened the epoxy resin-fiber interfaces to mitigate the evolution of fiber/fabric-matrix interfacial cracking and delamination under both static and cyclic loadings. As a consequence, significant improvements in the mechanical properties of tensile strength, stiffness and resistance to failure due to cyclic loadings resulted for this carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminate.",

          "abstract": "Delamination growth under fatigue loads in real composite components generally develops in a non-constant propagation mode. The aim of the investigation described in this article was to develop a model capable of predicting the fatigue delamination growth in a general case, under varying mode mix conditions. The crack growth development in essentially unidirectional laminates of carbon-fibre reinforced epoxy was analysed in terms of the Paris law for different constant propagation modes: mode I (double-cantilever beam test), mode II (end-notched flexure test) and different mixed-modes I/II (mixed-mode bending test). The dependence of the Paris law parameters on mode mix is compared with the existing models in the literature. It is shown that these models do not reproduce the non-monotonic dependence on mode mix which has been observed in experimental data. Therefore, an improved phenomenological model is introduced and compared with the experimental data obtained by other researchers. To check the ability of the model to predict variable mixed-mode fatigue delamination, the mixed-mode end-loaded split test was employed and the experimental results were compared to the predictions of the model. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the dependency of the crack propagation rates on the degree of mode mix are also discussed on the basis of fractographic analysis. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Dynamic compressive strength of quasi-isotropic fiber composite is investigated experimentally and also numerically simulated. In-plane compression tests at strain rates around 400/s quasi-isotropic laminates were performed using the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). The material system used was Texipreg® HS160 REM, comprising high strength unidirectional carbon fiber and epoxy resin. The dynamic strength of quasi-isotropic laminates exhibits a considerable increase when compared to the static values. The finite-element model used ABAQUS™ three-dimensional solid elements C3D8I with 8 nodes and user-defined interface finite elements with 8 nodes [Gonçalves JPM, de Moura MFSF, de Castro PMST, Marques AT. Interface element including point-to-surface constraints for three-dimensional problems with damage propagation. Eng Comp: Int J Comput Aided Eng Software 2000;17(1):28-47; de Moura MFSF, Pereira AB, de Morais AB. Influence of intralaminar cracking on the apparent interlaminar mode I fracture toughness of cross-ply laminates. Fatigue Fract Eng Mater Struct 2004;27(9):759-66.]. These interface elements which connect the three-dimensional solid elements modeling the composite layers, include a cohesive damage model allowing the simulation of delamination initiation and propagation. Hence the present model assumes that the phenomenon of failure under these conditions is mainly dictated by interface delamination. This is supported by experimental tests which showed that all quasi-isotropic laminates split into several almost intact sublaminates. The model compares very well with experimental results, confirming the formulated hypothesis that the internal layer damage does not markedly contribute to the quasi-isotropic laminate failure. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The constitutive cyclic damage model is calibrated by means of mixed mode fatigue experiments and reproduces the experimental results successfully and with minor error. It is concluded that only with implementing a cyclic damage variable in the cohesive interface element the experimentally observed crack growth and stiffness degradation can be captured properly.

Small quantities of titanium or carbon z-fibers (short rods) substantially improve delamination resistance in both types of specimen. Reinforcement raises the ultimate strength of the MMB specimen by a factor of three. However, the failure sequence and therefore the ultimate load in the T-stiffeners depend strongly on the test configuration. No change in ultimate load is seen in some cases but up to 40% improvement is observed in others. Improved delamination resistance results from crack bridging by the z-fibers, which reduces the driving force for crack growth. Mode I crack displacement is suppressed more effectively than mode II displacement, resulting in purely mode II cracking in what without z-fibers would be a mixed mode or primarily mode I loading situation. This important consequence of so-called large scale bridging effects confirms recent theoretical results for delamination specimens.

          "abstract": "Composite laminates (CFRP, GFRP, and fiber metal composite laminates) are attractive for many applications (such as aerospace and aircraft structural components) due to their superior properties. Usually, mechanical drilling operation is an important final machining process for components made of composite laminates. However, composite laminates are regarded as hard-to-machine materials, which results in low drilling efficiency and undesirable drilling-induced delamination. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the cost-effectiveness of currently-available drilling processes and to develop more advanced drilling processes for composite laminates. Such improvement and development will benefit from a comprehensive literature review on drilling of composite laminates. This review paper summarizes an up-to-date progress in mechanical drilling of composite laminates reported in the literature. It covers drilling operations (including conventional drilling, grinding drilling, vibration-assisted twist drilling, and high speed drilling), drill bit geometry and materials, drilling-induced delamination and its suppressing approaches, thrust force, and tool wear.

This study explored the resistance to delamination under fatigue loading of carbon and glass fiber prepreg laminates with the same resin system, containing various ply drop geometries, and using thicker plies typical of wind turbine blades. Applied stress and strain levels to produce significant delamination at ply drops have been determined, and the experimental results correlated through finite element and analytical models. Carbon fiber laminates with ply drops, while performing adequately under static loads, delaminated in fatigue at low maximum strain levels except for the thinnest ply drops. The lower elastic modulus of the glass fiber laminates resulted in much higher strains to produce delamination for equivalent ply drop geometries. The results indicate that ply drops for carbon fibers should be much thinner than those commonly used for glass fibers in wind turbine blades.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize the delamination fracture of continuous carbon fiber/epoxy multidirectional-laminates under Mode I, Mode II and Mixed-Mode I/II loading conditions. The present study considers the variation of the interlaminar failure energy, G C, with the extent of crack jumping, and ensuing fiber bridging, which arises during the growth of the delamination in the multidirectional-laminates under the various modes of loading. The main type of laminate which was studied was a multidirectional fiber composite prepared from 24 ply lay-ups of (-45°/0°/+45°) 2S(+45°/0°/-45°) 2S. The initial delamination was located at the +45°/-45° mid-plane of the specimen. It has been found that when the values of the interlaminar fracture energy, G C, are ascertained as a function of the length of the propagating crack, a, then very complex relationships are observed. This was the case for all the different modes of loading, and these observations reflected the complex failure paths which occurred as the delamination propagated through the multidirectional fiber composites. It was, however, possible to define clearly the onset of crack initiation. These results also revealed that the values for the interlaminar fracture energy, G C (initiation), at crack initiation for the (-45°/0°/+45°) 2S(+45°/0°/-45°) 2S multidirectional laminates were always significantly greater than that for the corresponding unidirectional (i.e., 0°/0°) laminates. © 1999 Technomic Publishing Co., Inc.",

Tensile tests on unidirectional unnotched laminates have shown that their mechanical properties follow the predictions offered by a simple law of mixtures approach. Tension-tension fatigue tests on notched unidirectional FMLs have shown that these laminates offer fatigue lives up to fifty times greater than those offered by a notched monolithic titanium alloy. An examination of the failed FMLs highlighted the presence of delamination between the titanium alloy and the fiber-reinforced composite. The experimental evidence suggests that this form of damage is harmful during fatigue loading conditions. It has also been shown that delamination is more widespread in FMLs based on thick composite layers than in laminates containing thin composite layers.",

Simulation of drilling process is an effective method in optimizing the drill geometry and process parameters in order to improve hole quality and to reduce the drill wear. In this research we have developed three-dimensional (3D) FE model for drilling CFRP. A 3D progressive intra-laminar failure model based on the Hashin&#039;s theory is considered. Also an inter-laminar delamination model which includes the onset and growth of delamination by using cohesive contact zone is developed. The developed model with inclusion of the improved delamination model and real drill geometry is used to make comparison between the step drill of different stage ratio and twist drill. Thrust force, torque and work piece stress distributions are estimated to decrease by the use of step drill with high stage ratio. The model indicates that delamination and other workpiece defects could be controlled by selection of suitable step drill geometry. Hence the 3D model could be used as a design tool for drill geometry for minimization of delamination in CFRP drilling. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The matrix epoxy with a thickness of 50 ??m was chosen as the interleaf material in order to clarify the effect of resin-rich layer thickness on the delamination fatigue crack growth behavior. Tests under mode I loading were carried out using double cantilever beam specimens. For tests under mode II loading, three-point end notched flexure specimens were used for interlaminar fracture toughness tests, while four-point end notched flexure specimens were used for delamination fatigue tests. The mode I properties (interlaminar fracture toughness and delamination fatigue threshold) of these epoxy-interleaved CFRP laminates were almost identical to those of the laminates without interleaf (base CFRP laminates). The effect of epoxy interleaf was completely different under mode II loading. The mode II interlaminar fracture toughness for the epoxy-interleaved laminates was 1.6 (initial value) and 3.4 (propagation value) times higher than that for the base CFRP laminates. The mode II delamination fatigue threshold of the epoxy-interleaved laminates was 2-2.3 times higher than those of the base CFRP laminates. While the toughness of the interleaf is the key factor under mode I, the thickness of interlayer is the key factor under mode II. The difference in the effect of the self-same epoxy interlayer on the interlaminar fracture properties under modes I and II loadings was discussed on the bases of the fractographic observations and mechanism considerations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown how these models associated with the statistical description of strength or energy released in the 90° plies make it possible to describe the development of transverse cracking in monotonic or fatigue loading. According to the nature of cross-ply laminates, transverse cracking is not, however, sufficient for describing the development of transverse cracks in 90° plies in the case of monotonic loading. In this case, the delamination process induced at transverse crack tips is to be considered for describing the experimental results. There are 108 references in this review article.",

Initially, the fracture properties of the two composite systems were characterized through a series of flexural and interlaminar fracture tests. Blast testing was then undertaken on a ballistic pendulum facility, capable of measuring the impulse imparted by the plastic explosive. Delamination, localized fiber buckling, fiber fracture, and shear failure at the boundary of the clamped plates were identified as the primary failure mechanisms in the laminates, with their severity depending on the panel thickness and the applied impulse. Delamination was very localized along the center plane of the laminate, a reflection of the very high interlaminar fracture toughness of these composites. The critical impulse for rear surface fiber fracture has been found to increase rapidly with laminate thickness for the range of panels considered here. The impulses associated with the onset of rear-surface fiber fracture and complete failure of the target were similar, suggesting that rear surface fiber fracture is a pre-cursor to complete failure in these laminates. Limited tests on the glass fiber-reinforced PEI system showed that it offers a superior blast resistance to its carbon fiber counterpart. © SAGE Publications 2008.",

The damage characteristics of a composite material subjected to subperforation impact can be classified as indentation, fiber breakage, matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding and delamination. Among these damage modes, delamination has been found to be important for all cases of loading. In this study, the damage characteristics of many composite plates made of glass/epoxy, Kevlar/epoxy, and graphite/epoxy were investigated. Delaminations in the impacted composite plates were inspected by high-intensity light, X-ray radiog- raphy, ultrasonic imaging system and edge replication. It was found that delamination in every interface of impacted composite plates had a peanut-like shape. Since membrane ef- fect could be ignored in this study, stresses caused by bending were the major stresses which should be responsible for the delamination. Although the interlaminar stresses had been analyzed by many investigators for the determination of delamination, in this study, however, the mismatching of bending stiffness between two adjacent laminae was pro- posed as an indicator of delamination in the composite laminates subjected to subperfora- tion impact. The effects of material properties, stacking sequence and thickness on the delamination were discussed. The justification of the hypothesis of bending stiffness mis- matching was also presented.",

The damage caused at the entrance of the drilled hole is characterized by delamination factor, which is evaluated by considering cutting speed, feed rate and point angle as affecting process parameters. The drilling experiments using cemented carbide (K20) twist drills were performed based on full factorial design of experiments with three levels defined for each of the process parameters. The computed values of delamination factor are empirically related to process parameters by developing a second order non-linear regression model based on response surface methodology (RSM). The effects of cutting speed, feed rate and point angle on delamination factor were analyzed using the models by generating response surface plots. The investigations reveal that the delamination tendency decrease with increase in cutting speed. The study also suggests low values of feed rate and point angle combination for reducing the damage.

With the presence of high crack-tip local stresses, the effect of inherently nonlinear composite material constitutive properties on the delamination becomes an interest and important issue. In this paper, a nonlinear anisotropic laminate elasticity formulation is introduced to establish governing field equations for a delamination between dissimilar fiber-composite plies. In the context of nonlinear fracture mechanics, the dominant stress singularity and asymptotic solution structure are determined for a delamination in a composite laminate with nonlinear ply constitutive properties. A computational method is used to analyze the delamination field in a composite with complex lamination variables. Delamination energy release rates associated with individual modes are obtained for symmetric angle-ply composite laminates for illustration. Several case studies are conducted to compare the solutions for nonlinear delamination problems with those of corresponding linear interface-crack problems. Unique features of nonlinear composite delamination mechanics are presented, including the order of stress singularity, coupled tearing-mode contributions, and large delamination closure due to strong ply material anisotropy, discontinuity and Poisson&#039;s effect. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

On the edge of laminates, out-of-plane stresses arise, even up to material&#039;s failure. Layer thickness is also known as well to influence delamination onset stress. Making use of a conventional model (that is to say assuming plies homogeneity, elastic linear behaviour, plane interlaminar surface and interface&#039;s infinite stiffness) and of a local stress tensor correction near the edge, allows, thanks to an asymptotic method, an efficient calculation of the full stress tensor. A stress criterion has then been studied. Criterion parameters assessment, from test results, has been focused on, based on conjugate gradient method and experimental thickness effect. Edge Delamination Tests have been performed on several specimens of various layups. Interlaminar shear, tension, as well as shear and tension combination have been investigated. Acoustic emission was used to detect delamination onset. As expected, these tests have exhibited layer thickness influence on onset stress. Shear parameter assessment shows good agreement between theory and experimental results. A single set of parameters is necessary to predict delamination for different layups. But experimental testing for both tensile and mixed mode has shown that failure may not be interlaminar, as expected, but intralaminar. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite laminates are widely used in aerospace industry for a great variety of structural parts. In order to enhance the exploitation of material reserves, there is a need for the integration of progressive damage scenarios in the design phase. Due to their hazardous effects on the load-carrying capacity of composite structures, this work focusses on the simulation of delaminations. A finite element based on a cohesive zone approach is developed. Two constitutive laws are proposed. One is characterized by linear degradation after delamination onset, the other is governed by exponential softening response. The damage process is history-dependent leading to an irreversible stiffness degradation in damaged zones. The practicability of the proposed model and the assets and drawbacks of the two material laws are shown by some numerical examples. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the industrial experiences, core drill shows better drilling quality than twist drill. However, chip removal is a troublesome problem when using the core drill. Conventional compound core-special drills (core-special drills and step-core-special drills) are designed to avoid the chip removal clog in drilling.

The current study develops a new device and to solve the problems of relative motion and chip removal between the outer and inner drills in drilling CFRP composite laminates.

In the present paper, a prediction is presented for the transverse crack density including the effect of delamination growth.

The dynamic delamination response under Mode I is investigated using visual and force measurements as well as numerical analysis to minimize errors due to the dynamics of this test. For loading speed larger than 3. m/s the double cantilever beam (DCB) is subjected to mixed Mode loading (Mode I/II). This result is inherent to the nature of the test and the impactor that introduced the load in the lower DCB arm. Numerical simulations show that this effect would also occur for UD laminates. Consequently the validity of the tests is limited to loading speeds below 3. m/s until which pure Mode I loading is achieved. For those loading rates optical analysis shows rate effects only at the crack initiation state which are stronger for the tufted interface. To avoid mixed mode effects at higher loading rates (&gt;3. m/s), the DCB specimen must be loaded at both arms simultaneously. Load cell recordings are not necessary as optical analysis is confirmed as a reliable technique for rate effect investigations. ?? 2012.",

The specimens with pristine nanotubes and functionalized nanotubes showed a small effect on the ILFT. The specimens with P-SWCNTs showed stable crack growth and the potential for enhanced crack bridging along with slightly higher GIc than F-SWCNT specimens. Scanning electron microscopy images showed enhanced fiber--matrix interfacial bonding in the specimens with F-SWCNTs.

Drilling-induced delamination occurs both at the entrance and at the exit planes. This paper presents an analysis of delamination during drilling. The analysis uses a fracture mechanics approach in which the opening-mode delamination fracture toughness, a material parameter, is used with a plate model of the laminate. The analysis predicts an optimal thrust force (defined as the minimum force above which delamination is initiated) as a function of drilled hole depth. Good agreement is achieved with data obtained from drilling carbon fiber-epoxy laminates. An advantage of the model is that it can predict varying degrees of delamination for other materials, such as glass fiber-epoxy, and for hybrid composites. In addition, the optimal thrust force for no delamination can be used to control a drilling machine with thrust force feedback for maximizing productivity.",

The largest effect was found for the ENF test (Mode II) for which the fatigue threshold value was only 10% of the critical strain energy release rate in static tests. Threshold values for MMB (mixed mode) and DCB (Mode I) tests were 15% and 23% of the static values, respectively. Fractographic evaluation revealed identical initial failure mechanisms in fatigue and static loading conditions for the ENF specimen. The ENF specimen failed by formation and coalescence of microcracks. The low fatigue threshold for the ENF specimen was explained by microscopical observations on the specimen edge. It was also shown that the fracture surfaces generated in static and fatigue DCB and MMB tests were similar.",

The specimen thickness and lay-up sequence had little effect on the through-the-thickness water absorption behavior of composite laminates, but the other parameters affected the moisture absorption rate and equilibrium water uptake in different ways and intensities. The glass transition temperature of composite laminates was strongly affected and linearly decreased by the quantity of equilibrium water uptake. A characteristic length of moisture migration through the unidirectional laminates was proposed as a function of fiber angle to the exposed laminate surface. In this approach, the fibers imbedded in the matrix were assumed to act as a barrier to the penetrating water molecules, and the developed model was well compared with the experimental results.",

The outside diameters of the cladding and polyimide coating are 40 and 52 ??m, respectively. First, a brief summary is presented for applications of small-diameter FBG sensors to damage monitoring in composite structures. Then, we propose a new damage detection system for quantitative evaluation of delamination length in CFRP laminates using Lamb wave sensing. In this system, a piezo-ceramic actuator generates Lamb waves in a CFRP laminate. After the waves propagate in the laminate, transmitted waves are received by an FBG sensor attached on or embedded in the laminate using a newly developed high-speed optical wavelength interrogation system. This system was applied to detect interlaminar delamination in CFRP cross-ply laminates. When the Lamb waves passed through the delamination, the amplitude decreased and a new wave mode appeared. These phenomena could be well simulated using a finite element analysis. From the changes in the amplitude ratio and the arrival time of the new mode depending on the delamination length, it was found that this system could evaluate the delamination length quantitatively. Furthermore, small-diameter FBG sensors were embedded in a double-lap type coupon specimen, and the debonding progress could be evaluated using the wavelet transform. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

In order to make use of a simple loading device, a mode-II case is used as the basis of the experimental study. The position of the crack is recorded quantitatively by means of a high-speed camera and dedicated image processing techniques. The delamination process is modeled by means of an interfacial Continuum Damage Model (CDM), similar to Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) approaches. In order to make suitable comparison between test and explicit finite element simulation of the test, criterai of proper temporal and spatial discretization have been derived. They ensure a fine description of the process zone and a proper description of the degradation evolution of the interface. Using such simulations and direct comparisons with the tests results, it is shown that the experimental results cannot be reproduced numerically without introducing rate effects. Then, it is proposed and identified by means of comparison between experiments and numerical simulation a bounded-damage-rate interfacial model. The main consequence of the proposed rate-dependent model is that it introduces a maximum crack velocity which is a function of the maximum damage rate. The dependence of the critical energy release rate on the crack’s velocity is analyzed, which leads to the identification of an equivalent rate-dependent fracture mechanics criterion.",

This is due to their poor transverse strengths and low delamination fracture toughness. In drilling, delamination is initiated when the thrust force exceeds a threshold value, particularly at the critical entry and exit locations of the drill bit. To minimize damage, therefore, it is important to monitor process variables such as the machining forces and the position of the tool relative to the workpiece. The availability of a suitable model coupled with an intelligent control scheme would be a large advancement in the machining of composite laminates. This paper explores the development of such models for machining of composites and for coupling the models to intelligent control strategies. Using a machining center, a series of drilling experiments were conducted on carbon fiber-reinforced composite laminates to determine key process parameters for various cutting conditions.

A continuum damage mechanics (CDM) based failure model is used to incorporate the progressive post-failure behavior. A set of Weibull distribution functions are used to quantify damage evolution and corresponding reduction in stiffness in different modes in the fibers. Similar functions based on strains are used for the resin. Fiber breakage is assumed as the only ultimate failure mode. In addition to these micro-failure modes, delamination, which is a macro-level failure, is also incorporated using an approach developed earlier for a ply-level progressive failure model.

          "abstract": "The machining of the glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) laminates may generate several kinds of damage. The most serious is the delamination that may occur during drilling, and which severely compromises the mechanical characteristics of the material around the hole. The main cause of delamination is generally held to be the thrust force exerted by the drill point; the most commonly used method for reducing delamination is to place a support under the workpiece. Paradoxically, while this practice does limit delamination, the force exerted by the drill point is actually greater than in unsupported drilling. The presence of the support does influence the delamination mechanism, but exactly how that mechanism works does not seem to be fully understood yet. This study analyzes the differences in delamination mechanisms when drilling with and without a support placed under the workpiece. This investigation has led to hypothesize two main differences in the mechanism. On the basis of this analysis, a new device was designed that counters the hypothesized delamination mechanism. A simple prototype of this device was built, and its effectiveness verified. The results show that the proposed device can drastically reduce delamination. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Mode II fracture toughness test and quasi-static indentation (QSI) test are conducted. The experimental results indicate that the interlayer zones formed by particles and matrix can significantly suppress delamination; mode II delamination resistance and damage resistance are significantly enhanced. The interleaved specimen can achieve small damage area at the expense of greater indent depth in local region. The toughening mechanisms are chiefly as follows: geometrical effect of interlayer, crack path deflection, and crack-tip shielding. Furthermore, a large amount of energy is absorbed by ductile deformation and ultimate failure of thermoplastic particles. © 2007 SAGE Publications.",

          "abstract": "Despite the recent success of modeling progressive damage of open-hole fiber reinforced composites subjected to tension (OHT), it is still a challenging task to predict the strengths and the damage progression of open-hole composite laminates under compressive loading (OHC). Herein, we propose a progressive damage model for OHC based on our early model for OHT and apply it to study the size effects of OHC. In the proposed model, continuum shell elements are used to account for both in-plane and out-of-plane deformation and delamination is modeled using cohesive elements. A smeared crack model is used to model the progressive failure of composite plies. It is found that the proposed model can predict accurately the experimental strengths and damage patterns with the assumption that the translaminar fracture toughness for blocked plies increases. The different failure mechanisms of the sublaminate scaled laminates of the stacking sequence 45/90/-45/0ms and the ply-level scaled laminates of stacking sequence 45n/90n/-45n/0ns are found to be closely related to the in-plane shear stress of the central 0° ply block and the initiation of interface delamination.",

This test system, based on the DCB test specimen, is a mass-spring-specimen dynamic system designed to resonate. The defined operating conditions allow performing delamination propagation tests under imposed load and stopping the test under reproducible conditions, identical to the ones recommended in the ASTM-D6115 standard. This system allows fatigue tests to be driven up to 100. Hz, reducing the time taken by a factor of ten without detrimental heat being generated in the material. The effect of frequency on the fatigue delamination growth on mode I has been investigated through a comparison with standard tests performed at 10. Hz. A decrease in resistance to the propagation of delamination is observed with the increase in frequency for the composite studied. This frequency effect seems to be a strain rate effect and was taken in consideration by using dynamical critical energy restitution rate for the G- N curve plotting. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The Zanchor process is a novel through-thickness reinforcement technique in which in-plane yarns are entangled with each other using special needles. Mode I interlaminar fatigue crack growth behavior was investigated in carbon fiber (CF)/epoxy cross-ply laminates with Zanchor reinforcement. The laminates were molded with a Zanchor-reinforced CF dry fabric through resin film infusion (RFI). Delamination fatigue tests were carried out using double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. The threshold values of the maximum energy release rates, GImaxth, under R = 0.1 were 70 J/m2 for Zanchor 0 (base laminate without Zanchor reinforcement) and 240 J/m2 for Zancor 2 (the density of Zanchor reinforcement is twice as high as the unit density), respectively; those under R = 0.5 were 80 J/m2 for Zanchor 0 and 400 J/m2 for Zancor 2, respectively. Thus, the threshold values for Zanchor 2 were about 3.4-5 times higher than those without Zanchor reinforcement. This increase induced by Zanchor reinforcement is almost the same or higher than that obtained under static loading (3.5 times). It is common that the increase in the fracture toughness, GIc, induced by replacing the matrix resin with a tougher system only partially contributes to the increase in the fatigue threshold, GImaxth. On the other hand, the increase in GIc induced by Zanchor reinforcement was fully translated to the increase in GImaxth. This is why Zanchor 2 gives one of the highest fatigue threshold values among existing toughened composite material systems. The difference between the reinforcing effects under static and fatigue loadings was discussed in conjunction with the microscopic fracture mechanism. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this study, carbon fiber-reinforced poly-cyclic butylene terephthalate laminates were manufactured, drilled, and inspected. Different commercial drill geometries and machining conditions were compared. Roughness, microscopy, and non-destructive tests allowed us to determine the hole quality as well as delamination. The surface tests showed better results after working at the most common cutting speed (3000 rpm) than at high speed (15,000 rpm) with a constant feed rate. This fact can be explained based on the viscoelastic properties of the matrix that becomes fragile at high cutting speeds. The Delamination factor obtained by means of Ultrasonics and X-ray Computed Tomography also confirmed that the best results are achieved with a Twist drill bit at 3000 rpm. In contrast to carbon fiber-reinforced thermosets, the detected delamination at high cutting speeds is not as remarkable as expected. These results allow us to conclude that this new composite will certainly increase production rate without delamination damage. Chip formation takes also a special role. It can be recovered to be used as reinforcement in manufacturing processes due to the recyclability of the thermoplastic matrix.",

The model applies to micro-fasteners in the form of brittle fibrous rods (Z-pins) inserted in the through-thickness direction of composite laminates. These are described as Euler-Bernoulli beams inserted in an elastic foundation that represents the embedding composite laminate. Equilibrium equations that relate the delamination opening/sliding displacements to the bridging forces exerted by the Z-pins on the interlaminar crack edges are derived. The Z-pin failure meso-mechanics is explained in terms of the laminate architecture and the delamination mode. The apparent fracture toughness of Z-pinned laminates is obtained from as energy dissipated by the pull out of the through-thickness reinforcement, normalised with respect to a reference area. The model is validated by means of experimental data obtained for single carbon/BMI Z-pins inserted in a quasi-isotropic laminate. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The paper studies the effect of edge stitching on tensile static and fatigue properties of graphite fiber reinforced laminates. The influence of Kevlar stitchings on edge delaminations, ultimate tensile strength and tension-tension fatigue life were examined on laminates of two stacking sequences ([??45/0/90]s and [??30/90]s), as representative of two classes of fiber-dominated and matrix-dominated laminates. Through-thickness stitching offered a significant improvement in the static delamination resistance of laminated composites, but had varying effects on the ultimate tensile stress of the laminates under study, with an increase in strength of [??30/90]s laminates and a decrease in strength of [??45/0/90]s laminates. Similarly the fatigue life of matrix dominated [??30/90]s specimens was considerably extended by stitching, while the fatigue resistance of fiber-dominated [??45/0/90]s specimens was reduced, particularly at high fatigue stresses. Stitching appeared very efficient in arresting delamination in [??30/90]s specimens for both static and fatigue loads, but did not prove to be as efficient in stopping fatigue delaminations in [??45/0/90]s specimens, since Kevlar threads were found to be prone to breakage under cyclic loading. As a conclusion, while the static delamination resistance of laminated composites is improved by stitching, this does not automatically result in better fatigue performance for all lamination sequences. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A damaged exponential traction-displacement jump relationship is proposed for the cohesive model and an exponential damage evolution law on the evolvement of displacement jump is proposed to describe the irreversible delamination crack propagation. The implementation of cohesive model uses zero-thickness cohesive element and middle-plane isoparametric interpolation technique. The mesh size effect is solved by regulating the delamination fracture toughness by the cohesive length, and the numerical convergence problem for the snap instability is addressed by viscous regularization. Four representative delamination cases of composite laminates are used to validate the proposed cohesive model: (a) double cantilever beam (mode-I), (b) end notch flexure (mode-II), (c) mixed-mode bending fracture, and (d) fixed ratio mixed mode. The effects of the cohesive strengths and mesh sizes on the global load-displacement response for four cases are studied. In addition, the numerical results using proposed cohesive model are also compared with the results obtained by the virtual crack closure technique and other existing cohesive models.

The specimens with dog bone shape were cut from the original plates having 3 mm thickness and fiber weight fraction of 0.66. Static tests were performed in order to study the influence of delamination size on the laminate stiffness and strength. Complementary finite element analysis was carried out showing the influence of angular misalignments of fiber/matrix delaminations on the laminate stiffness. Fatigue tests were performed in load control for R = 0.05 and R = --1, with a loading frequency of 10 Hz, at room temperature.

          "abstract": "Machining processes are generally used to cut; drill, or contour composite laminates for building products. In fact, drilling is one of the most commonly used manufacturing processes to install fasteners for assembly of laminate composites. The material anisotropy resulting from fiber reinforcement heavily influences the machinability during machining. Machining of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) components is often needed in spite of the fact that most FRP structures can be made to near-net shape and drilling is the most frequently employed secondary machining process for fiber reinforced materials. Therefore, the precise machining needs to perform to ensure dimensional stability and to obtain a better productivity of the component. The drilling parameters and specimen parameters evaluated were speed, feed rate, drill size and specimen thickness. A series of experiments were conducted using TRIAC VMC CNC machining center to machine the composite laminate specimens at various cutting parameters and material parameters. The measured results of delamination at the entry and exit side of the specimen were measured and analyzed using commercial statistical software MINITAB14. The experimental results indicated that the specimen thickness, feed rate and cutting speed are reckoned to be the most significant factors contributing to the delamination. A signal-to-noise ratio is employed to analyze the influence of various parameters on peel up and push down delamination factor in drilling of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composite laminates. The main objective of this study is to determine factors and combination of factors that influence the delamination using Taguchi and response surface methodology and to achieve the optimization machining conditions that would result in minimum delamination. From the analysis it is evident that among the all significant parameters, specimen thickness and cutting speed have significant influence on peel up delamination and the specimen thickness and feed have more significant influence on push down delamination. Confirmation experiments were conducted to verify the predicted optimal parameters with the experimental results, good agreement between the predicted and experimental results obtained to be of the order of 99%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The virtual crack closure technique which is employed to calculate the energy release rate (ERR) for crack propagation is used to deal with the delamination growth. Three typical failure criteria: B-K law, Reeder law and Power law are comparatively studied for predicting the crack propagation. Effects of different mesh sizes and pre-existing crack length on the delamination growth and postbuckling properties of composite laminates are discussed. Interaction between the delamination growth mechanisms for multiple cracks for 04//(????)6//04 composite laminates is also investigated.

A rational design with thin plies requires understanding the effect of ply thickness on each damage mechanism. This paper presents an experimental investigation into damage occurrence in a quasi-isotropic laminate made from thin-ply, bi-axial, Non-Crimp-Fabric (NCF), under different off-axis uniaxial loadings. The NCF layers are positioned through the laminate thickness creating two regions, namely THICK and THIN (with and without ply clustering). Then, the onset and progress of three damage mechanisms (transverse matrix cracking, matrix crack induced delamination and free-edge delamination) for both regions are analyzed by monitoring the specimen&#039;s free-edge. The results show that the critical region where damage occurs is that with ply clustering (THICK), whereas delamination originating from matrix cracks or free edge effects are delayed or even suppressed in the THIN region. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

In this paper, finite element modelling of delamination buckling of composite panels is discussed. ANSYS 5.4 has been used for modelling the delamination buckling. A 3-D model with 8-node composite shell element is used. The panel is hypothetically divided into two sub-laminates by a plane containing the delamination. The two sub-laminates are modelled separately using 8-node composite shell element. Appropriate constraint conditions are added for the nodes in the undelaminated region using Coupled Nodes facility of ANSYS. The nodes in the delaminated region, whether in the top or bottom laminate, are left free. Using this modelling approach, a few typical test problems have been solved. The computed buckling loads and strain energy release rate values for the test problems tally closely with that of thoery and other researchers. In addition to the test problems, some results on delamination buckling of a woven-fabric carbon-epoxy composite panel are also presented. The two sub-laminate model discussed here provides a convenient approach to delamination buckling analysis.",

          "abstract": "Due to their high specific strength and stiffness, fibre-reinforced composite materials are being increasingly used in structural applications where a high level of performance is important (e.g. aerospace, automotive, offshore structures, etc.). Performance in service of these composites is affected by multi-mechanism damage evolution under loading and environmental conditions. For instance, carbon fibre-reinforced laminates demonstrate a wide spectrum of failure mechanisms such as matrix cracking and delamination. These damage mechanisms can result in significant deterioration of the residual stiffness and load-bearing capacity of composite components and should be thoroughly investigated. The delamination failure mechanism is studied in this paper for a double cantilever beam (DCB) loaded in mode I. Several sensitivity studies are performed to analyse the effects of mesh density and of parameters of the cohesive law on the character of damage propagation in laminates. The microstructural randomness of laminates that is responsible for non-uniform distributions of stresses in them even under uniform loading conditions is accounted for in the model. The random properties are introduced with the use of Weibull&#039;s two-parameter probability density function. Several statistical realisations are carried out which show that the effect of microstructure could significantly affect the macroscopic response emphasizing the need to account for microstructural randomness for accurate predictions of load-carrying capacity of laminate composite structures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that pre-straining of the composite laminates has no noticeable influence on the size of the delamination area for the given impact energy of 8J, which represents a typical barely-visible impact on thin-skin composite structures. For composite scarf joints, however, resulting damage has been found to be a combination of adhesive disbonding and matrix cracking (delamination and intraply cracking) in the composite laminate. The size of this mixed type of damage increases significantly with increasing pre-strain levels. A finite element model was developed to investigate the interaction between adhesive disbonding and composite delamination. The computational results reveal that both delamination and adhesive disbonding are dominated by the mode II fracture. Since the critical mode II fracture energy release rate for composite laminates (G IIC=1.08kJ/m 2) is much less than that pertinent to the adhesive (G IIC=3.73kJ/m 2), delamination tends to occur first in the composite laminates, which then shield the growth of disbonding in the adhesive. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

However, the selection of the appropriate bending stiffness of the beam arms can avoid this tendency allowing this characterization. In the present work, six stacking sequences numerically analyzed have been experimentally tested to validate the methodology. The obtained results show that crack jumping can be effectively avoided by increasing the stiffness of the crack arms. Micrographies of the tested specimens show that the delamination is not a perfect interlaminar fracture as fiber tearing is also involved. The obtained toughness values show a dependency upon both the amount of fiber bridging and the interface angles.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, the correlation between interlaminar fracture toughness and impact energy absorption for the fracture of epoxy-carbon laminates was studied. Carbon fibres-epoxy cross-ply prepreg layers were interleaved with thin (26 ??m) poly(ethylene-terephthalate) (PET) films. Before the composite preparation, circular holes 1 mm in diameter were drilled in the PET films at several densities (from 0 up to 44 holes/cm2) in order to selectively increase the interlaminar contact area between the epoxy-carbon laminae. In this way, the interlaminar contact area was gradually varied from 0%, corresponding to the case in which non-perforated PET films were used, up to 100% in the case of non-interleaved laminates. The Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the resulting laminates was determined according to the ASTM D-5528-01 standard test method on double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. The critical values of the strain energy release rate determined at the point at which the load versus opening displacement curve becomes non-linear (GIC,NL) resulted to vary from 40 up to 260 J/m2, depending on the interlaminar contact area. All the laminates were then characterized by three point bending tests performed both under quasi-static (5 mm/min) and impact (2 m/s) loading conditions. The elastic modulus of the laminates resulted to be practically independent of the level of interlaminar adhesion, while the bending strength decreased as the interlaminar fracture toughness decreased. The total energy to fracture evaluated under impact conditions showed a non-monotonic correlation with the interlaminar fracture toughness, reaching a maximum level in correspondence of a GIC,NL value of about 60 J/m2. At the same time, the ductility index, i.e. the ratio between the propagation and the initiation energies, evaluated by instrumented Charpy impact tests, markedly increased as the interlaminar fracture toughness decreased. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact velocity, force, and energy ranged from 2.0 to 4.0 m/s, 900 to 2100 N and 0.46 to 1.80 J, respectively. Based on this preliminary study, results showed that; polymer nanofabric interleaving marginally increased the laminate thickness, by about 2.0%. Polymer nanofabric interleaving increased the threshold impact force by about 60%, reduced the rate of impact damage growth rate to one-half with impact height and reduced impact damage growth rate from 0.115 to 0.105 mm2/N with impact force. The concept has merit for more detailed study for optimizing and for multi-functionalizing fiber reinforced composite laminates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

To develop the nanocomposite laminates, a spraying technology was used to deposit nanotubes on both sides of each four-harness satin weave carbon fiber fabric piece for the 12 ply laminate lay up. For these experimental studies the carbon fiber reinforced epoxy laminates were fabricated using a heated vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (H-VARTM??) method followed by a 2 soak curing cycle. The f-CNTs toughened the epoxy resin-fiber interfaces to mitigate the evolution of fiber/fabric-matrix interfacial cracking and delamination under both static and cyclic loadings. As a consequence, significant improvements in the mechanical properties of tensile strength, stiffness and resistance to failure due to cyclic loadings resulted for this carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminate. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

On the other hand, drilling is an operation frequently used in industry due to the need for component assembly in mechanical pieces and structures. So the aim of this paper is the study of the cutting parameters (cutting velocity and feed rate) on power (Pc), specific cutting pressure (Ks), and delamination in carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs). A plan of experiments, based on the techniques of Taguchi, was established considering drilling with prefixed cutting parameters in an autoclave CFRP composite laminate. The analysis of variance was preformed to investigate the cutting characteristics of CFRPs using cemented carbide (K10) drills with appropriate geometries. The objective was to establish a correlation between cutting velocity and feed rate with the power (Pc) specific cutting pressure (Ks) and delamination factor (Fd) in a CFRP material. Finally, this correlation was obtained by multiple linear regression. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Since delaminations of composite laminates are usually invisible or difficult to detect by visual inspections, delamination causes low reliability for primary structures. Automatic systems for delamination identifications in-service are desired in order to improve this low reliability. The present study employs an electric resistance change method for detection of delaminations. Since the method adopts reinforcement carbon fibre itself as sensors for delamination detections, this method does not cause reduction of static strength or fatigue strength; also, this method is applicable to existing structures. In the present study, a relationship between fibre volume fraction and orthotropic electric conductivities is confirmed by experimentation and the effect of measured orthotropic electric conductance on delamination monitoring is discussed analytically with FEM analyses. Two types of cross-ply laminates are prepared for delamination monitoring analyses: [0/90]s and [90/0]s. Electric resistance changes due to delamination creation are discussed for both specimen types with results of electric current density diagrams. As a result, it can be concluded that the fibre volume fraction has a large effect on electric conductance of the transverse and thickness directions, and electric conductance of the thickness direction has significant effects on delamination detection with the electric resistance change method. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This was followed by a series of perforation tests on multilayer configurations.It has been shown that both the composite and the aluminum substrates exhibit a low degree of rate-sensitivity, with both the tensile strength and the perforation energy increasing slightly in passing from quasi-static to dynamic rates of loading. Similarly, FMLs based on combinations of the composite and metal constituents exhibit a low degree of rate-sensitivity, with the impact perforation energy and the maximum impact force being only ten to fifteen percent higher than their quasi-static values. An examination of the cross-sections of the failed laminates indicated that the failure processes were similar at both quasi-static and dynamic rates of strain. Also, similar levels of plastic deformation, fiber fracture and delamination were observed at both rates. Finally, it has been shown that the energy to perforate the various FMLs is directly related to the aggregated perforation energies of their constituent parts.",

Impact fracture tests were performed by the WIF (wedge-insert-fracture) method with a SHPB (split Hopkinson pressure bar) system for accurate measurement of impact fracture toughness, while quasi-static fracture tests were performed by the DCB (double-cantilever-beam) method with a screw-driven testing machine. In the present composite laminates, the fracture toughness decreased stepwise with increasing loading rate showing a distinct rate-sensitive transition region and two rate-insensitive regions above and below. As a consequence of this stepwise characteristic, the crack growth behaviour varied with loading rate: in and below this transition region, the crack grew unstably accompanied by high-speed propagation and arrest; but above the transition region, the crack grew stably and continuously. This trend was well explained by a simple model incorporating the rate dependence of fracture toughness and the contribution of kinetic energy in the specimen during unstable crack propagation.",

Our experiments were performed on bend-test bars that were loaded either in &#039;supported&#039; four-point bending or under &#039;unsupported&#039; conditions with a Hopkinson pressure bar to induce dynamic loading. We found differences in the damage that occurred in specimens loaded by the two techniques, in terms of the number of cracks and the length of the cracks. In the case of quasi-static loading, there were many matrix cracks within individual plies and only a few delamination cracks between plies; the maximum ratio of numbers of matrix to delamination cracks observed was 6:1. Despite their small number, the delamination cracks had a greater total length than the matrix cracks, and specimen failure occurred as a result of delamination crack propagation. During dynamic loading, the ratio between numbers of matrix and delamination cracks was 3:1, and in this case the ratio between the total crack lengths was unity. A quantitative assessment of damage induced during quasi-static bending was made from specimen stiffness results. Using simple beam theory and knowing the location of the damage, we correlated beam stiffness to the materials effective elastic modulus. We found that the composite&#039;s effective modulus decreased rapidly with small amounts of initial damage, but that subsequent increases in damage decreased the effective modulus at a much lower rate.",

They are often investigated separately, and so the interaction between two damage modes has not yet been revealed. In this paper, a simple parallel-spring model is introduced to model the longitudinal stiffness reduction due to matrix cracking and edge delamination together. The energy release rate of edge delamination eliminating the matrix crack effect and the energy release rate of matrix cracking in the presence of edge delamination are then obtained. Experimental materials include carbon- and glass-fibre-reinforced bismaleimide composite laminates under static tension. The growth of matrix cracks and edge delaminations was recorded by means of NDT techniques. Results show that matrix cracks may initiate before or after edge lamination. This depends on the laminate layup, and especially on the thickness of the 90?? plies. Edge delamination may also induce matrix cracking. Matrix cracking has a significant effect on the stiffness reduction in GRP laminates. The present model can predict the stiffness reduction in a laminate containing both matrix cracks and edge delaminations. The mixed-mode delamination fracture toughness obtained from the present model shows up to 50% differences compared with O&#039;Brien&#039;s model for GRP laminates. However, matrix cracking has a small effect on the mixed-mode interlaminar fracture toughness of the CFRP laminates. ?? 1994.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have shown the severe limitations that have to be placed on machining forces when drilling composite laminates due to their propensity for delamination. Delamination, which consists of separation between the plys in a laminate, is due to the relatively poor strength of these materials in the thickness direction. In drilling, delamination is initiated when the drilling force exceeds a threshold value, particularly at the critical entry and exit locations of the drill bit. While abrasive machining results in damage-free holes in most composites, such processes are slow and expensive when compared to drilling with conventional twist drills. Here it is shown that the chisel edge in such drills is a major contributor to the thrust force that is the primary cause of delamination when drilling composite laminates. In this study, a series of drilling experiments were conducted on carbon fiber-reinforced composite laminates to determine quantitatively the effect of the chisel edge on the thrust force. In addition, tests were conducted to determine the effect of pre-drilling the laminate with a pilot hole. The results show a large reduction in the thrust force when a pilot hole is present which, in effect, removes the chisel edge contribution. An analytical model that incorporates the presence of a pilot hole is also described. The results from the thrust force-feed relationships show good agreement with experimentally determined values for the thrust force for a wide range of feeds for drilling tests conducted on laminates with and without pilot holes.",

          "abstract": "Surface free energy has been often treated as a scalar constant without considering its dependence on propagation direction. It is desirable, however, to investigate how surface free energy or fracture toughness of delamination in a single interface varies with both the local mismatch angle of fiber directions and the direction of crack propagation in polymeric laminate composites. As a materials constant, fracture toughness is effectively used for various mechanical analyses of fiber-reinforced composites as well as conventional materials. This study investigates quantitatively and qualitatively the dependence of delamination fracture toughness on mismatch angle and crack propagation direction in laminated structures. AS4-Carbon/Epoxy prepregs were used for fabricating test specimens, and 50 different mismatch angles of fiber direction were applied on the delaminated interface of laminates. Fracture toughness was measured using the Mixed-mode Bending (MMB) test. This test method is composed of fracture mode-I and mode- II, and the mixed-mode ratio (GII/G) can be controlled. The mixed-mode ratios used here were 20, 35, 50, 65, and 80%. The crack path and the delamination fracture toughness were observed and calculated for specimens, and the dependence of the toughness was shown to be related to the mismatch angle of ply fibers at the delaminated interface. The relationship between mismatch angle and delamination fracture toughness was newly revealed and discussed for various angles. These results can be usefully applied to various fracture mechanics analyses in fiber-reinforced laminated composites. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Interlaminar fracture at the delamination front is found to be a mixed-mode phenomenon due to the anisotropy and heterogeneity of thermo-physical properties of composite materials. This leads to the requirement of finite element evaluation of energy release rates, based on the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The strain energy release rate components along the delamination front due to a uniform temperature drop, during the manufacturing stages of composite laminates, to room temperature and subsequent mechanical loading is obtained by superimposing their respective effects based on the assumptions of linear elasticity. Numerical calculations are carried out for multi-layered cross-ply and angle-ply composite laminates and energy release rate plots demonstrate large asymmetries along the delamination front due to the interaction of residual stresses and superimposed transverse loading. ?? 2005.",

The growth rate of cyclic delamination between the aluminium sheets and the fibre/epoxy composite core could be related to the effective strain energy release rate (Gmax -Gth) by a Paris type equation, dD/dN = c(Gmax - Gth)m, where c and m are fitting constants. The threshold energy release rate Gth could be separated into two terms, G0th and Gr. It was shown that Gr could be related to the strain energy release rate solely due to thermal residual stresses in the laminate, while G0th might represent a parameter related to the intrinsic interfacial characteristics. Interestingly, the three constants c, m and G0th were found to be independent of the volume fraction of carbon/epoxy and the magnitude of thermal residual stress. Therefore, once the constants c, m and G0th were determined, the fatigue delamination growth in the hybrid laminate with various carbon/epoxy contents and/or thermal residual stresses could be predicted readily by this empirical equation.",

On the edge of laminates, out-of-plane stresses arise, even up to material failure. Layer thickness is also known as influencing delamination onset stress. Making use of (i) a conventional model assuming plies homogeneity, damageable elastic behaviour, plane interlaminar surface also infinite interfacial stiffness and (ii) a local stress tensor correction near the edge, allows an efficient calculation of the full stress tensor, thanks to an asymptotic method. Then, a stress criterion was studied. The assessment of criterion parameters from test results was based on conjugate gradient method and experimental thickness effect. Edge delamination tests were performed on several specimens with various lay-ups and loaded under interlaminar shear, tension and compression. Acoustic emission was used to detect delamination initiation. As expected, these tests have exhibited layer thickness influence on onset stress. The assessment of shear and tension parameters shows good agreement between theory and experimental results. But the influence of interlaminar compressive stresses seems insufficiently taken into account in the criterion formulation. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The evaluation of the drilling-induced delamination damage in these materials is rather difficult, particularly for the carbon fiber-based composites. This is attributed to their color that makes the current visual inspection techniques extremely difficult. This paper presents a non-contact nondestructive technique for measuring and determining the extent of delamination in composite materials. The approach developed consists of utilizing a shadow moir?? laser based imaging technique. This technique allows the assessment of the degree of delamination resulting from the machining processes necessary for final set-up and assembly. Mechanical drilling has been implemented on carbon fiber reinforced epoxy (CFRE) composites. The effects of cutting variables (feed and speed) on the delamination size in mechanical drilling of CFRE composites have been investigated. The discussed work should improve reliability and economy in fabrication and assembly of carbon fiber-based composites. Moreover, the results show that the proposed technique is easily adaptable to typical manufacturing environments and possesses promising advantages with respect to accuracy and simplicity. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, pyramidal truss sandwich cores with relative densities ρ¯ in the range 1–10% have been manufactured from carbon fiber reinforced polymer laminates by employing a snap-fitting method. The measured quasi-static shear strength varied between 0.8 and 7.5MPa. Two failure modes were observed: (i) Euler buckling of the struts and (ii) delamination failure of the laminates. Micro-buckling failure of the struts was not observed in the experiments reported here while Euler buckling and delamination failures occurred for the low (ρ¯⩽1%) and high (ρ¯&gt;1%) relative density cores, respectively. Analytical models for the collapse of the composite cores by these failure modes are presented. Good agreement between the measurements and predictions based on the Euler buckling and delamination failure of the struts is observed while the micro-buckling analysis over-predicts the measurements. The CFRP pyramidal cores investigated here have a similar mechanical performance to CFRP honeycombs. Thus, for a range of multi-functional applications that require an “open-celled” architecture (e.g. so that cooling fluid can pass through a sandwich core), the CFRP pyramidal cores offer an attractive alternative to honeycombs.",

In the present study, a wireless system using a tiny oscillation circuit for detecting delamination of carbon/epoxy composites is proposed. In this system, a tiny oscillation circuit is attached to the composite component. When delamination of the component occurs, electrical resistance changes, which causes a change in the oscillating frequency of the circuit. Since this system uses the composite structure itself as a sensor and the oscillating circuit is very small, it is applicable to rotating components. The electrical resistance change and oscillating frequency change due to delamination is experimentally measured using carbon/epoxy specimens. The effects of temperature changes are also measured. The wireless method is found to successfully detect embedded delamination, and to estimate the size of the delamination.

          "abstract": "This study is aimed at comparing the response of TS-based (epoxy) and TP-based (PPS or PEEK) laminates subjected to low velocity impacts. C-scan inspections showed that impact led to diamond-shaped damage resulting from different failure mechanisms: fiber breakages in warp and weft directions, more or less inter-laminar and intra-ply damage, and extensive delamination in C/PEEK and C/epoxy laminates. The permanent indentation can be ascribed to specific mechanisms which mainly depend on many factors including the ultimate out-of-plane shear strength, and the interlaminar fracture toughness in modes I-II-III. In TP-based laminates, the matrix plasticization seems to play an important role in matrix-rich areas by locally promoting permanent deformations. Fiber-bridging also prevents the plies from opening in mode I, and slows down the propagation of interlaminar and intralaminar cracks in modes II-III. Both mechanisms seem to reduce the extension of damages, in particular, the subsequent delamination for a given impact energy. In epoxy-based laminates, the debris of broken fibers and matrix get stuck in the cracks and the adjacent layers, and create a sort of blocking system that prevents the cracks and delamination from closing after impact. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The influence of ply orientation on the resistance to mode I delamination of multidirectional composite laminates can be assessed by Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) tests. However, one of the difficulties associated with such a study is the change in overall elastic parameters occurring when modifying local ply orientations. The present work uses laminates with special stacking sequences allowing for isolating the orientation parameter. Multidirectional DCB specimens were designed so as to obtain an uncoupled quasi isotropic and quasi-homogeneous elastic behavior, with the same properties for the entire laminate and the two sub laminates separated by the pre crack at mid-plane. The results show that the toughness in term of GIC is slightly affected by the variation of ply orientations at the crack interface. The differences are more pronounced in the crack propagation behavior after the initiation point. Even with the same orientation at the crack interface, different subsequent ply orientations can also lead to different crack resistance behavior. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Among all machining operations, drilling using twist drill is the most frequently applied for secondary machining of composite materials owing to the need for structure joining. Delamination is mostly considered as the principal failure model in drilling of composite materials. Drill wear is a serious concern in hole-making industry, as it is necessary to prevent damage of cutting tools, machine tools and workpieces. The industrial experience shows the worn drill causes more delamination. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of delamination caused by the drill wear for twist drill in drilling carbon fiber-reinforced composite materials. The critical thrust force at the onset of delamination for worn drill is predicted and compared with that of ideal drill. The experimental results demonstrate that though the critical thrust force is higher with increasing wear ratio, the delamination becomes more liable to occur because the actual thrust force increases to larger extent, as the thrust factor (Z) illustrates. Compared to sharp drill, the worn twist drill allows for lower feed rate below which the delamination damage can be avoided. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Composite structures in practice can be subjected to various types of damage such as abrasion with sharp objects. This damage can result in gouges or damage resembling deep scratches that can impact one or more plies. In this study, the effects of scratch geometry on the delamination of a laminated composite under tensile loading are investigated using experimental and numerical analysis techniques. A numerical approach based cohesive zone models is used to simulate the progressive failure of the composite specimen containing scratches. Scratches at different depths in carbon fiber-epoxy laminates are modeled to study the influence of the scratch tip and its interaction with the stacking sequence. Experimental results show the interlaminar crack propagation has good correlation with the proposed modeling approach for initiation and propagation load levels. These deformation modes are validated with a full-field digital image correlation assessment. The results indicate that the scratch tip location within the stacking sequence is a dominant factor for tension load capacity associated with the scratch depth and geometry and can result in undesirable bending and torsional deformations, further driving the delamination response. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The tensile properties of the plain aluminum, the composite materials and the thermoplastic fiber-metal laminates were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. The fatigue tests were also conducted under load control in accordance with the ASTM E466 standard procedure. Various loading cycles were employed for the fatigue tests in order to minimize the possibility of heat generation on the composite materials. Load levels of 40, 60 and 80% of yield strength of each thermoplastic fiber-metal laminate panel were applied with zero to max loading. The glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene hybrid systems exhibited higher fatigue strength than the self-reinforced polypropylene-based fiber-metal laminates. Then, punch-stretch forming tests were performed in order to evaluate the formability of the hybrid systems. Experimental results revealed that the self-reinforced thermoplastic composite-based fiber-metal laminate exhibit excellent forming properties similar to that of the monolithic aluminum alloy of comparable thickness. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "The characteristics of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics allow a very broad range of uses. Drilling is often necessary to assemble different components, but this can lead to various forms of damage, such as delamination which is the most severe. However, a reduced thrust force can decrease the risk of delamination. In this work, two variables of the drilling process were compared: tool material and geometry, as well as the effect of feed rate and cutting speed. The parameters that were analyzed include: thrust force, delamination extension and mechanical strength through open-hole tensile test, bearing test, and flexural test on drilled plates. The present work shows that a proper combination of all the factors involved in drilling operations, like tool material, tool geometry and cutting parameters, such as feed rate or cutting speed, can lead to the reduction of delamination damage and, consequently, to the enhancement of the mechanical properties of laminated parts in complex structures, evaluated by open-hole, bearing, or flexural tests.",

The outside diameters of the cladding and polyimide coating are 40 and 52μm, respectively. First, a brief summary is presented for applications of small-diameter FBG sensors to damage monitoring in composite structures. Then, we propose a new damage detection system for quantitative evaluation of delamination length in CFRP laminates using Lamb wave sensing. In this system, a piezo-ceramic actuator generates Lamb waves in a CFRP laminate. After the waves propagate in the laminate, transmitted waves are received by an FBG sensor attached on or embedded in the laminate using a newly developed high-speed optical wavelength interrogation system. This system was applied to detect interlaminar delamination in CFRP cross-ply laminates. When the Lamb waves passed through the delamination, the amplitude decreased and a new wave mode appeared. These phenomena could be well simulated using a finite element analysis. From the changes in the amplitude ratio and the arrival time of the new mode depending on the delamination length, it was found that this system could evaluate the delamination length quantitatively. Furthermore, small-diameter FBG sensors were embedded in a double-lap type coupon specimen, and the debonding progress could be evaluated using the wavelet transform.",

The reduction to the compression modulus, strength and fatigue performance of carbon/epoxy laminates with increasing volume content and diameter of pins is determined. The elastic modulus decreases at a quasi-linear rate with increasing pin content and pin diameter. Softening is caused by fiber waviness around the pins and reduced fiber volume content due to volumetric swelling of the laminate from the pins. A simple model is presented for calculating the compression modulus of pinned laminates that considers the softening effects of fiber waviness and fiber dilution. The compression strength and fatigue life also decrease with increasing volume content and diameter of the pins. The strength and fatigue properties are reduced by fiber kinking caused by fiber waviness around the pins and the reduced fiber content caused by swelling. The deterioration to the compression properties is also dependent on the fiber lay-up pattern of the laminate, with the magnitude of the loss in properties increasing with the percentage of 0° (load bearing) fibers in the laminate.

In this study, an iterative method based on internal strain measurements and parametric numerical modeling is employed to identify a traction-separation relation in quasi-static mode I dominated delamination of a cross-ply carbon fiber epoxy laminate. The results demonstrate that crack propagation is accompanied by a large bridging zone which is smaller than the zone in a uniaxial composite specimen of the same materials and linear dimensions. While the initiation value of the energy release rate (ERR) is the same, the ERR at steady state propagation and the maximum stress in the bridging zone are respectively 1.7 and 3.1 times larger than the corresponding values of the unidirectional specimen. The obtained traction-separation relation is employed in a cohesive zone model to predict the loading response and crack growth.

The evaluation of these damaged areas is important to assess the effects of the laminate microstructure on the response of the material to the imposed loading. In this paper bulletproof laminates were obtained using 30 plies of glass-fiber reinforced-epoxy matrix composites. The ballistic performance of these laminates was varied by modifying the properties of the constituent laminate or by changing the laminate assemblage. An automated digital analysis procedure was developed in order to determine size and shape parameters that characterize the damaged areas. The procedure developed proved to be robust and sensible enough to cope with subtle variations on the damaged areas, which are due to the differences on the mechanical response of the composites caused by modifications on their microstructure. The results obtained show that not only the area of delamination is important to quantify the ballistic performance. The isotropy of the ballistic response, determined measuring the Feret Ratio or the Circular Shape Factor, is also important. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Previous works have already proved that this mesomodel can be interpreted as the homogenized result of micromodels involving common microdamage mechanisms: transverse microcracking, delamination at the tips of transverse microcracks and fiber-matrix debonding. Here, we are going one step further by considering microcracking in skin plies of various thicknesses. To fit experimental results better, we introduced a modification of the coupling of the three microdamage scenarios in all plies. Contrary to the classical approach, the critical values of the energy release rate are not associated with a healthy material but with a damaged material; the first damage mechanism to occur is associated with non-transverse microcracks due to nearly uniformly distributed fiber-matrix debonding in the damaged ply. These mechanisms and this coupling are homogenized on the mesoscale, which leads to an improved version of the &quot;damage mesomodel for laminates&quot; involving only a small number of material constants which can be interpreted on the microscale. Thickness effects are taken into account: the improved version, unlike the previous one, is valid for arbitrary values of the thickness.

The Quickstep process is a unique composite production technology which utilizes the fast heat transfer rate of fluid to heat and cure polymer composite components. The manufacturing influence on the mode I delamination fracture toughness of laminates was investigated by performing double cantilever beam tests. The composite specimens fabricated by two processes exhibited dissimilar delamination resistance curves (R-curves) under mode I loading. The initial value of fracture toughness GIC-INIT was 564J/m2 for the autoclave specimens and 527J/m2 for the Quickstep specimens. However, the average propagation fracture toughness GIC-PROP was 783J/m2 for the Quickstep specimens, which was 2.6 times of that for the autoclave specimens. The mechanism of fracture occurred during delamination was studied under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three types of fracture were observed: the interlayer fracture, the interface fracture, and the intralaminar fracture.

More fiber bridging was found in the process of delamination for the Quickstep specimens. Better fiber/matrix adhesion was found in the Quickstep specimens by conducting indentation-debond tests.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new cohesive model to stably and accurately simulate the delamination propagations in composite laminates under quasi-static and low-velocity impact transverse loads using comparatively coarse meshes. In this model, a pre-softening zone ahead of the existing traditional softening zone is proposed. In this pre-softening zone, the initial stiffnesses and the interface strengths at the integration points of cohesive elements are gradually reduced as the corresponding effective relative displacements at these points increase. However, the onset displacement corresponding to the onset damage is not changed in this model. Moreover, the fracture toughness of materials for determining the final displacement of complete decohesion is kept constant. This cohesive model is implemented in the explicit time integration scheme combined with a powerful three-dimensional (3D) hybrid finite element for evaluating the delamination propagations on interfaces in composite laminates. A DCB problem is employed to analyze the characteristics of the present cohesive model. In order to reduce the computational cost for dealing with more complex problems, a stress-based criterion is also adopted in our numerical model for evaluating various in-plane damages, such as matrix cracks, fiber breakage, etc. Finally, two experimental examples are employed to illustrate the validity of the present approach. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Tensile tests on unidirectional unnotched laminates have shown that their mechanical properties follow the predictions offered by a simple law of mixtures approach. Tension-tension fatigue tests on notched unidirectional FMLs have shown that these laminates offer fatigue lives up to fifty times greater than those offered by a notched monolithic titanium alloy. An examination of the failed FMLs highlighted the presence of delamination between the titanium alloy and the fiber-reinforced composite. The experimental evidence suggests that this form of damage is harmful during fatigue loading conditions. It has also been shown that delamination is more widespread in FMLs based on thick composite layers than in laminates containing thin composite layers.",

Differences in adhesive bonding were achieved by using two different aluminum surface treatments, one with a standard P2-Etch procedure and another with a modified FPL-Etch procedure with the subsequent application of a silane coupling agent. Double-cantilever beam (DCB) tests were conducted to measure the interfacial fracture energy, and an increase in interfacial fracture toughness by up to six times was achieved by using the latter method. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to study the failure behavior and fracture mechanisms of the CFRMLs. No clear differences were found in laminate mechanical properties such as tensile strength and Young’s modulus. A reduction of 10% in the relative value for the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was observed for the laminate with poor interfacial adhesion associated with the P2-Etch method, in both three- and five-point bend tests. However, the residual strength of the notched CFRMLs is, in general, almost independent of the adhesion status between aluminum sheets and composite prepreg, although a slight increase in residual strength for laminates with weak interfacial adhesion was observed in the presence of small holes, because of the difference in delamination growth.",

The delamination is a major problem associated with the drilling fiber reinforced composite materials, which reduce the structural integrity of the material. The present work focuses on the analysis of delamination behavior as a function of drilling process parameters at the entrance of the CFRP plates. The delamination analysis in high speed drilling is performed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model with spindle speed, feed rate and point angle as the affecting parameters. A multilayer feed forward ANN architecture, trained using error-back propagation training algorithm (EBPTA) is employed for this purpose. Drilling experiments are conducted as per full factorial design using cemented carbide (grade K20) twist drills that serve as input–output patterns for ANN train- ing. The ANN model so developed is validated by presenting training and new testing input patterns. The validated ANN model is then used to generate the direct and interaction effect plots to analyze the delam- ination behavior. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the ANN models to analyze the effects of drilling process parameters on delamination factor. The analysis also demonstrates the advan- tage of employing higher speed in controlling the delamination during drilling.",

The material system investigated was a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composite. The thermomechanical properties required for the analysis were obtained from tests on unidirectional laminates. The laminates investigated for damage initiation and growth were [30/-30/90]s and [0/??45/90]s. Mechanical testing was conducted at 23 ??C and -196 ??C. The microcrack and delamination were determined using acoustic emission and/or small incremental step loadings. The residual stresses due to difference in curing and test temperatures were calculated using classical laminated plate theory with thermo-mechanical properties generated, and their effect on the initiation of damage was assessed. The stress levels at the initiation of microcrack and delamination determined by experiment were compared with analytical predictions using the maximum stress criteria. The interlaminar free-edge stresses were analyzed using a global-local model. The results of this stress analysis were compared with the experimental results. While the residual stresses increase with decreasing test temperature, so do the composite transverse and shear strengths, and these two effects compete in their influence on the stress at onset of initial damage. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Two different types of polymer-matrix-based Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic laminates were selected to evaluate the effect of resin properties on bearing response. A special measurement system using a non-contact electro-optical extensometer to measure hole elongation is proposed. During static tensile testing, the response of bearing damage was monitored by acoustic emission measurement. Several specimens were observed by means of soft X-ray radiography and SEM at different loading levels to assess internal damage. The observations indicate that the bearing failure can be outlined as a process of compressive damage accumulation, and can be divided into the following four stages: Damage onset; damage growth; local fracture; structural fracture. Major features of bearing failure include fiber micro-buckling, matrix cracking, delamination and out-of-plane shear cracking. Bearing strength and failure mode should also depend on the lateral constraints and the &quot;toughness&quot; of different polymer-matrix based laminates. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Loadings of pure mode I, pure mode II and different ratios of mixed mode I/II, i.e. opening tension and sliding shear, have been applied to double cantilever beam (DCB), end-loaded split (ELS), fixed-ratio mixed-mode (FRMM), and mixed-mode bending (MMB) specimens. Optical and scanning electron microscopy techniques were used to identify distinguishing fractographic features and to establish the differences between static and fatigue fracture, as well as the differences between the various modes of fracture. The cusp angle and the amount of fibre pull-out on the fracture surface can be used to characterise the different loading modes. A large amount of fibre pull-out is the dominant feature of a mode I fracture whereas cusps are characteristic features of a mode II fracture. Fatigue fracture surfaces exhibited slightly more debris than static fracture surfaces: this is thought to be due to the fretting nature of fatigue. For the same reason, shear cusps (hackles) were more rounded and less distinct in fatigue than on static fracture surfaces. In certain fatigue cases, it was observed that polyethersulphone (PES), a toughening agent used in the formulation of the epoxy resin, came out of the matrix; the reason for this is not fully understood. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science Limited All rights reserved.",

Design/miethodology/approach - This involves experimental investigation of FRP composites with woven roving fibers and matrix. Different types of composites, i.e. glass: epoxy, glass: polyester and (carbon + glass): epoxy are used in the investigation with change in percentage of constituents. The variability of fiber content of the composite is in the range of 0.55-0.65 weight fractions. The matrix dominated property, like inter laminar shear strength (ILSS) has been studied by three point bend test using INSTRON 1195 material testing machine with increasing five cross head velocities. Findings - The variation of ILSS of laminates of FRP composites is significant for low loading speed and is not so prominent for high speed. The variation of ILSS are observed to be dependent on the type and amount of constituents present in the composites. The laminates with carbon fiber shows higher ILSS than that of glass fiber composites. The laminates with epoxy matrix shows higher ILSS than polyester matrix composites for the same fiber. There is no significant variation of ILSS beyond loading speed 200 mm/min and this can be used for specifications of testing. Matrix resins such as polyester and epoxy are known to be highly rate sensitive. Carbon fiber are relatively rate independent and E-glass fibers are rate sensitive. Woven roving carbon glass fiber reinforced polymer shows small rate dependence and woven roving glass fiber reinforced polymer shows significant rate sensitivity. Originality/value - The findings are based on original experimental investigations in the laboratories of the institute and can be used for characterization of composites.",

Then, the governing equations for the stress and displacement fields of the unit cell are derived. The obtained approximate stress field is used to calculate the energy release rate for the propagation of transverse cracking and induced delamination. To show the capability of the new method, it is employed for the analyses of general laminates with [0/90]. s, [45/-45]. s, [30/-30]. s and [90/45/0/-45]. s lay-ups under combined loadings to calculate the energy release rate due to the transverse cracking and induced delamination. It is shown that the obtained energy release rates for transverse cracking and delamination initiation are in good agreement with the available results in the literature and finite element method. Furthermore, the occurrence priority of further transverse cracks and/or delamination at each damage state of the laminates will be discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Nonlinear behaviors that are specifically addressed in this study are elastic material nonlinearity in the fiber direction and plastic deformation of matrix origin. Compressive behaviors and strengths of unidirectional laminates, along with quasi-isotropic laminates, are measured using T800H/3633 and interlayer-toughened T800S/3900-2B systems. The compressive strength of unidirectional laminates is predicted based on the kink band formulation incorporating nonlinear behaviors. It yields a non-conservative prediction that typically contrasts with experimental results. However, nonlinear behaviors of quasi-isotropic laminates are well predictable using classical lamination theory with nonlinear properties. Predicted compressive strengths based on strength criteria of a 0?? layer concur with experimental results. Discussion of the compressive strength of CFRP laminates is provided through comparison of experimental results for unidirectional and multidirectional laminates. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Load-unload tests are performed to identify the sequence and extent of damage and the corresponding displacements at which they occur for a wide range of laminate thicknesses. Energies absorbed at different levels of damage are obtained from the load-unload curves. Two different support spans of 25.4 mm (1 in.) and 101.6 mm (4 in.) diameter with different layers (1, 2, 4, 6, 11, and 22 with 0.6 mm ply thickness) of composite laminates are tested under quasi-static loading to identify compression-shear and tension-shear dominated modes of damage. After each test, the damaged plates are sectioned to visualize the extent of delamination and material damage. Numerical punch-shear experiments are conducted using LS-DYNA 970. The numerical modeling is carried out using a newly developed composite damage model, namely MAT 162, which has been incorporated into LS-DYNA. MAT 162 uses damage mechanics principle for progressive damage and material degradation. Input data required in MAT 162 have been calibrated to match the experimental results of 22-layer composite plate of both spans (25.4 and 101.6 mm). The calibrated material properties have been used to simulate other thicknesses, and the simulated results show good agreement with experiment results. It has been found that the dominant damage mechanisms are delamination and fiber breakage due to shear and tension. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Several empirical models have been conceived to account for this discrepancy, as well as the effect of block sequence. The approach taken here is based on the underlying mechanisms. A cross-ply laminate was used as a model material. In general, composites show both initiatory and progressive mechanisms under fatigue loading. The former is active at high static stresses, whereas the latter predominates at lower stress amplitudes where they are given sufficient time to propagate. Initiatory mechanisms give rise to damage from which the progressive mechanisms can start, and conversely the progressive mechanisms continually alter the local stress state which results in further damage accumulation caused by the initiation controlled mechanisms. In a cross-ply laminate, the initiatory mechanism is the formation of transverse cracks, and the progressive mechanism is mainly delamination growth initiated from the transverse cracks. In an experimental investigation of carbon fiber/epoxy cross-ply laminates, the interaction of these mechanisms has shown why a sequence of high-low amplitude levels results in shorter lifetimes than a low-high order. Such a sequence effect seems to be a common behavior for many other composite materials, and can be mechanistically explained by a similar kind of interaction. Advantages and drawbacks of the mechanistic approach compared with empirical rules are also discussed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

However, direct measurement of the bridging tractions is a challenging task.

Double cantilever beam specimens with integrated arrays of wavelength-multiplexed fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) are subjected to mode I loading. Non-uniform strain distribution in the vicinity of the interlaminar crack plane is locally monitored by means of the several embedded FBG sensors of 1 mm gauge length. Employing an inverse identification procedure, the measured strain data are used to determine the bridging tractions associated with delimitation growth. It is shown that such an iterative procedure can be effectively applied for characterization of the energy release rate due to the fiber bridging in specimens of different thicknesses. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2014.",

This identification is based on initiation and propagation delamination tests. Our analysis of the conventional propagation tests makes use of the links existing between the critical-energy release rates and some of the model&#039;s parameters. In taking into account the part of the energy dissipated inside the layers, the interfaces can be classified into two categories: the 0°/0° interfaces of brittle behaviour, and the itnerfaces at disorientated angles whose critical-energy release rate is greater.

Delamination is the most common defect during drilling because of the heterogeneity of both the fibers and the matrix. The delamination, in general, is an irregular shape and size, containing long and fine breaks and cracks at the exit of the drilled hole, especially in the drilling of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). On the other hand, a core-saw drill is designed to reduce the threat of chip removal in drilling composite materials. Since the thrust force of core-saw drill is distributed toward the periphery, the core-saw drill allows a larger critical thrust force than the twist drill at the onset of delamination when drilling composite materials. The aim of this paper is to present a novel approach of the equivalent delamination factor (F ed) to characterize drilling-induced delamination using a core- saw drill and compare it with the adjusted delamination factor (F da) and the conventional delamination factor (F a). The experimental results indicated that the F ed obtained is considered suitable for characterizing delamination at the exit of a hole after drilling CFRP. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.",

This research adopts the acoustic emission technique to study the failure mechanisms and damage evolution of carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminates. Effects of different lay-up patterns and hole sizes on the acoustic emission response are studied to set up the mapping between the failure properties and the acoustic signal features such as the energy, counting and amplitude. Moreover, the microscopic properties of different composite specimens after fracture are watched and analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Based on the mapping conception, the controlling microscopic failure mechanisms of composites including the splitting matrix cracking, fiber/matrix interface debonding, fiber pull-out and breakage as well as delamination are identified. It is expected the influence of complex lay-up patterns and sizes on the damage and failure properties of composites is represented by creating true mapping based on the acoustic emission technique.",

Amongst all machining operations, drilling using a twist drill is the most commonly applied method for generating holes for riveting and fastening structural assemblies. Most of the previous research correlates the drill geometry and feed rate to thrust force and delamination on the performance of a twist drill. The Taguchi method has been used to solve many engineering problems. In this investigation, drilling-induced thrust force and delamination by core-saw drill during drilling CFRP laminates were selected as quality character factors to optimize the drilling parameters to obtain the smaller-the-better characteristics. For thrust force and delamination quality character factors, the optimum conditions in drilling were also A1B1C3, (i.e., diameter ratio = 0.55, feed rate = 8 mm/min and spindle speed = 1,200 rpm).",

          "abstract": "Thin-ply composites are rapidly gaining interest in the composite industry, not only because of the larger design possibilities that they offer, but also because of positive size effects that have been shown to improve performance in various loading conditions [1]. In this work, carbon fiber-epoxy composites of different ply thicknesses (30-300g/m2 fiber areal weight) were produced from the same batch of Toray M40JB fiber and NorthTPT TP80ep matrix to study the influence of ply thickness on the ultimate strength and on the onset of damage in lamina, laminates and components. Uniaxial tension, open-hole compression and open-hole tensile fatigue tests on quasi isotropic [45??/90??/-45??/0??]ns laminates showed very significant improvements regarding the on-set of damage, and in some cases ultimate strength, when decreasing the ply thickness. These performance improvements are the result of major changes in the damage progression and failure modes of the laminates caused by a systematic delay or near suppression of transverse cracking and delamination growth in thin-ply composites. On the component level, thin-ply laminates enabled a marked improvement for bolted-joint bearing, especially in hot-wet conditions. Under impact, the 30??m thin ply laminate exhibited a quasi-brittle failure with extensive translaminar cracking while a ply thickness of 100??m was found as optimum to minimize the projected damage area. Ply thickness scaling of transverse and in-plane shear strength was identified based on classical laminate theory and unnotched tensile tests on quasi-isotropic specimens. The empirical scaling was found to follow a linear trend over a range of ply thicknesses from 30 to 250??m. Due to the near suppression of delamination, the strength of thin-ply composites could then be modeled more effectively than thick ply composites using classical laminate theory or standard multilayer shell modeling. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

There exist different nondestructive tests (NDTs) to reveal delaminated zone, including digital photography, X-ray CT scanning, and ultrasonic C-Scan. Different delamination factors were presented to quantify delamination extension. In this paper, some difficulties regarding revealing damaged zone in drilling of woven carbon fiber-reinforced plastics laminates are discussed. In addition, different NDTs as well as available delamination factors are examined. For NDTs, clarity of pictures, applicability, and reliability are compared to help researchers select proper option. The result of this study demonstrates that compare to other available factors, the adjusted delamination factor Fda varies in wider ranges in normal engineering applications. It is less sensitive to the implemented NDT and it presents different values for different delamination extension patterns. Therefore, pattern-sensitive factor Fda is more suitable to quantify damaged zone. However, for cases with low circularity parameter f, like drilling of unidirectional composite laminates with extended damaged zone, Fda may be replaced by easily measured diameter delamination factor Fd.",

Engng. Fracture Mech. 28, 13-20; Raju, I.S., Creus Jr., J.H., Aminpour, M.A., 1988. Engng. Fracture Mech. 30, 383-396.) In this paper, sublaminates governed by transverse shear deformable laminate theory are adopted to model such delamination. Oscillatory singular stresses around the delamination tip are avoided as a result. Instead, stress resultant jumps are found in the sublaminates across the delamination tip. It transpires that mode I, II and III energy release rates can then be obtained using the virtual crack closure technique. The results produced by this approach for a homogeneous double cantilever beam and an edge-delamination in a non-homogeneous laminate show good agreement with those available in the literature. The approach produces both total and individual components of energy release rate for delamination, which converge as the sublaminate division is refined and the sizes of the delamination tip elements decrease. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The laminate is 12-ply graphite/epoxy woven fabric L-shaped laminate subject to quasi-static loading perpendicular to one arm. Delamination initiation and propagation are observed using high speed camera and load-displacement data is recorded. The quasi-static shear loading initiates delamination at the curved region which propagates faster than the shear wave speed of the material, leading to intersonic delamination in the arms. In the numerical part, the experiments are simulated with finite element analysis and a bilinear cohesive zone model. Cohesive interface elements are used between all plies with the interface properties obtained from tests. The simulations predict a single delamination initiating at the corner under pure mode-I stress field propagating to the arms under pure mode-II stress field. The crack tip speeds transition from sub-Rayleigh to intersonic in conjunction with mode change. In addition to intersonic mode-II delamination, shear Mach waves emanating from the crack tips in the arms are observed. The simulations and experiments are found to be in good agreement at the macro-scale, in terms of load-displacement behavior and failure load, and at the meso-scale, in terms of delamination initiation location and crack propagation speeds. Finally, a mode dependent crack tip definition is proposed and observation of vibrationsduringdelaminationispresented. This paper presents the first conclusive evidence of intersonic delamination in composite laminates triggered under quasi-static loading.",

Vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) and vapor grown carbon nanofiber (VGNF) were chosen as the reinforcement for the interlayer. To illustrate the effect of the interlayer on the fracture toughness of the laminates, several types of carbon fiber reinforced plastics/carbon nanofiber (CFRP/CNF) hybrid laminates were fabricated. Each laminate was composed of unidirectional carbon/epoxy prepregs with carbon nanofiber varying the interlayer thickness. Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness was evaluated by a standard double cantilever beam (DCB) test. Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness was evaluated by an end notched flexure (ENF) test using a three point bending test. The experimental results of the DCB test confirms that the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness for hybrid laminates is about 50% greater than the base CFRP laminates. Furthermore, the results of the mode II fracture toughness test confirms that the interlaminar fracture toughness for hybrid laminates is 2-3 times greater than base CFRP laminates. In addition, the results revealed the recommended range of CNF interlayer thickness is between 100 and 150 ??m (approximately 20 g/m

Using a drop-weight impact tester, an impact loading was applied to the laminates at four impact energy levels. After the impact tests, the internal damages including delaminations were observed by ultrasonic C-scan, and the reflection spectra from the embedded FBG sensors were measured. The form of the spectrum changed sensitively depending on the delamination size. Furthermore, the spectra were calculated theoretically for confirmation of the measured spectra. Since the change in the measured spectrum was consistent with that in the calculated spectrum, the relationship between the delamination size and the form of the spectrum could be clarified. From the results, the present method using small-diameter FBG sensors was found to be effective for the monitoring of the delamination. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The fatigue tests were performed at room temperature on unnotched and notched parallel-sided plate specimens. The carbon/nylon unnotched laminates exhibit a higher relative fatigue strength than the carbon epoxy unnotched laminates. Different fracture modes appear for the carbon/epoxy unnotched laminates, and the development of progressive and extensive delamination leads to a longer fatigue life and a larger reduction in tensile modulus. Such a fracture mode dependence is not observed for the carbon/nylon unnotched laminates. Regarding the notched specimens, the failure mechanism of the carbon/epoxy laminates is exclusively governed by the progressive delamination from the notch tips, while no appreciable effects of the notches are observed on the notch tip fracture of the carbon/nylon laminates. This much different notch sensitivity results in a slightly higher relative fatigue strength for the carbon/epoxy notched laminates.",

A 2-D shear lag method is used to determine stresses in a laminate representative segment containing one crack and two crack tip delaminations. For the calculation of the strain-energy release rate (SERR) associated with delaminations, the damaged layer is replaced with an equivalent homogeneous one with effective elastic properties. Closed-form expressions for the total SERR and its mode I and mode II components as a linear function of the first partial derivatives of the effective elastic properties of the damaged layer with respect to delamination area are derived. Dependence of SERRs and the laminate stiffness properties on delamination area, crack density and ply orientation angle is examined for balanced [O2/??2/-??2]5 and unbalanced [O2/??2]5 carbon/ epoxy laminates. The total SERR obtained in this study is compared to a simple closed-form expression for a uniform local delamination derived in earlier work by O&#039;Brien (Local delamination in laminates with angle-ply matrix cracks: Part II Delamination Fracture Analysis and Fatigue Characterization.

          "abstract": "An accurate laminate model developed by using multilayer shear deformable plate modeling and interface elements, based on fracture mechanics and contact mechanics, is proposed to analyze mixed mode delamination in composite laminates. Perfect adhesion along the undelaminated portion of the delamination plane is simulated by treating interface stiffnesses as penalty parameters, whereas to enforce interface displacement continuity between plate elements constituting each sub-laminate above or below the delamination plane, the Lagrange multiplier method is used. The governing differential equations are derived through a variational procedure by using a modified total potential energy functional. Results are obtained by numerical integration of the non-linear three-point boundary value problem modeling mixed-mode delamination of the laminate plate subjected to end loading, which accounts also for the frictionless contact condition. The coupling of a penalty procedure with the Lagrange multiplier method, results in an accurate and direct energy release rate evaluation. Comparisons with results available from the literature obtained with a local continuum approach, show that mode partition may be performed to the desired accuracy by refining multilayer plate models for each sub-laminate. In addition, original analytical formulas for mode partition are obtained by coupling the interface approach and fracture mechanics concepts, evidencing the effectiveness of the proposed approach and gaining a better insight into the influence of shear effects on mode decomposition. Numerical computations for practical problems, evidence both the relative simplicity and the efficiency of the proposed model to represent mixed mode interlaminar fracturing as well as crack-face interaction. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, problems in drilling, particularly the heterogeneity and anisotropy of composite materials, increase delamination. Several studies have proved that delamination is related to the thrust force in drilling composite materials. The thrust force of step-core drill with drilling parameters (diameter ratio, feed rate and spindle speed) in drilling carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) laminates were experimentally investigated in this study. The results indicate that diameter ratio and feed rate have the most significant influence on the overall performance of step-core drills and step-core-saw drill produces the highest drilling thrust force. The advantages of the step-core drill design are that the thrust force exerted is distributed toward the drill periphery in drilling. The diameter ratio may be a viable alternative for the step-core drill in terms of drilling thrust. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The results confirm the analytical findings and are consistent with the industrial experience. Ultrasonic scanning is used to evaluate the extent of drilling-induced delamination. The advantage of these special drills is illustrated mathematically as well as experimentally, that their thrust force is distributed toward the drill periphery instead of being concentrated at the center. The allowable feed rate without causing delamination is also increased. The analysis can be extended to examine the effects of other future innovative drill bits. ?? 2005.",

First, monotonic and loading/unloading tensile tests were conducted on dry and wet specimens at ambient and high temperatures to compare the stress/strain response and damage development. The changes in the Young&#039;s modulus and Poisson&#039;s ratio were obtained experimentally from the monotonic tensile tests. The critical stresses for transverse cracking and delamination for the above three conditions are compared. The delamination area is measured by using scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) at various loads to discuss the effects of delamination on the nonlinear stress/strain behavior. Next, the stress distributions under tensile load including hygrothermal residual stresses are computed by a finite-element code and their effects on damage initiation are discussed. Finally, a simple model for the prediction of the Young&#039;s modulus of a delaminated specimen is proposed. It is found that moisture increases the critical stresses for transverse cracking and delamination by reducing the residual stresses while high temperature decreases the critical stresses in spite of relaxation of the residual stresses. The results of the finite-element analysis provide some explanations for the onset of transverse cracking and delamination. The Young&#039;s modulus predicted by the present model agrees with experimental results better than that predicted by conventional models.",

MWCNTs with varied surface conditions were prepared by oxidization or esterification, and then dispersed into a DGEBA epoxy system. The dispersion of the MWCNTs in the epoxy was improved by surface modification, resulting in improved composite mechanical properties as well. Significant increases in elastic modulus and strength were observed for epoxies with functionalized MWCNTs, especially for esterified species. When MWCNT - filled epoxies were used as matrices for basalt fiber/epoxy laminates, however, the reinforcement effects of MWCNTs on the composite elastic modulus exceeded micromechanics based semi-empirical predictions and were independent of surface functionalization. SEM morphological observations and the results of the micromechanical model revealed that nanotube re-distribution and orientation during processing was responsible for the enhancement of fiber-dominated mechanical properties. This work demonstrated the feasibility of in situ alignment and dispersion of functionalized nanotubes in multi-scale composite laminates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Delaminations are modeled using a cohesive type tie-break interface introduced between sublaminates while intralaminar damage mechanisms within the sublaminates are captured in a smeared manner using a strain-softening plastic-damage model. In the latter case, a nonlocal regularization scheme is used to address the spurious mesh dependency and mesh-orientation problems that occur with all local strain-softening type constitutive models. The results for the predicted damage patterns using the nonlocal approach are encouraging and qualita- tively agree with the experimental observations. The predictive performance of the pro- posed numerical model is assessed through comparisons with available instrumented impact test results on a class of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates. Force-time histories and other derived cross-plots such as the force versus projectile displacement and progression of projectile energy loss as a function of time are compared with available experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the model in capturing the details of the dynamic response. Another case study involving the blast loading of CFRP composite laminates is used to further highlight the capability of the proposed model in simulating the global structural response of composite laminates subjected to distributed pressure pulses.",

For long delaminations, Kevlar?? stitched glass/epoxy composite laminate is best in retaining its buckling strength when re-loading is done.

Such a technique expands the design space of the laminate, and the ability to tailor local laminate properties may provide a means, for example, to mitigate stress concentrations that arise in places such as along free edges of the laminate. Preliminary fabrication of tiled laminates produced material with an elastic modulus that is nearly equal to that of continuously reinforced laminates; however, the strength of these first specimens was significantly reduced. Finite element analyses were then performed to characterize the effects of features unique to tiled composite laminates, such as the existence of resin-rich tile-to-tile interfaces, and to explore the effects of relative arrangement of tiles through the thickness of the laminate. This led to a novel composite joint geometry as well as recommendations to minimize strength reduction. Strength retention of laminates fabricated using the new design guidelines was experimentally found to exceed 92% in comparison with the traditional analogs. Finally, we discuss the potential application of composite tiling for the suppression of free-edge delamination.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, the damage progression and failure characteristics of stitched composites under out-of-plane loading are experimentally investigated. Test specimens, stitched with various stitch densities and stitch thread thicknesses, are studied using quasi-static indentation test. Test specimens are loaded and unloaded in 0.5. mm incremental indentation displacement to examine for damage phenomena using non-destructive inspection techniques namely ultrasonic C-scan, X-ray radiography and X-ray micro-computed tomography to elucidate complex damage mechanisms and fracture behavior. Recorded test history of load-displacement curves indicate that damage progression can be characterized into three stages: damage initiation, damage propagation and final damage failure. Results show that damage initiation occurs at a lower load in stitched composites due to the presence of resin-rich regions which act as crack initiation sites. X-ray radiography convincingly shows that stitch-induced matrix crack lines are joined between stitch loops, being particularly evident in densely stitched composites. During damage propagation, stitching becomes highly effective in suppressing delamination growth, resulting in stitched laminates having much smaller delamination area compared to unstitched laminates, and the rate of delamination growth being inversely related to stitch density. It is found out that final failure is distinguished by a sharp load drop in the load-displacement curve. It is revealed that the final failure load increases with increasing stitch fiber volume fraction. The final failure mechanism in unstitched and moderately stitched composite is mainly delamination failure; while densely stitched composite failed by indenter penetration comprising of in-plane fiber fracture and matrix crushing. Energy absorption throughout the quasi-static indentation process is presented and discussed. This work provides novel insight to the damage progression and damage penetration of stitched composites. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Fibre metal laminates form a class of materials in which homogeneous aluminium sheets are combined with fibre reinforced prepreg layers. Intensive experimental analyses have been carried out to assess the possible application of new design methods which make use of the layered structure of fibre metal laminates. To support the experimental analyses, numerical models have been developed to describe delamination in fibre metal laminates. To achieve this goal, a special continuum element and corresponding interface elements are introduced. Loading functions have been derived to account for delamination. The loading functions are either applied for the continuum or for the interface element. Using this methodology the impact of delamination on spliced fibre metal laminates has been studied numerically and has been compared to experimental results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Independent of the approach used for the analysis, mode I threshold values of selected CFRP seem to be in the range between about 30 and 100 J/m2, i.e., roughly around the range of critical mode I energy release rate values (denoted by GIC) obtained from fracture testing of neat commercial epoxy resins, but clearly below quasi-static initiation GIC-values for unidirectional CFRP composites.

This work is a study of the effect of delaminations in laminates with initial curvature. Initial curvature typically results in an increased buckling load and the hypothesis was that the reduction in compressive strength due to delamination would be less in a curved specimen than a flat one. Glass fibre reinforced plastic test laminates were manufactured containing artificial delaminations of different sizes and through thickness positions. The laminates were either flat or curved, where the plane of curvature was normal to the loading direction. Compressive load was applied to the laminates and measurements of out of plane displacements and failure loads were made. Contrary to expectations, the curved laminates gave lower failure loads than flat laminates, for the same delamination size and through thickness position. Finite element simulation was carried out to predict out of plane displacement and failure load, with failure being assessed using a maximum stress criterion. Good agreement between finite element predictions and experimental measurements of load versus deflection behaviour was observed for both flat and curved laminates. Ultimate failure loads were also well predicted for the flat laminates but relatively poorly for the curved laminates. The finite element predictions depend on modelling accurately the out of plane displacement behaviour, which was found to be very sensitive to the boundary conditions for the case of curved laminates. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Drilling tests were conducted on aramid and carbon fiber-reinforced composite laminates using an instrumented machining center. Machining parameters for the damage-free drilling of these materials were established together with semi-empirical relationships between drilling forces and cutting parameters. The drilling force responses as a function of various feed rates and drill sizes were characterized to define the key process stages taking place during a drilling cycle. Using a previously established delamination-based criterion for initiating damage during drilling, the critical feed rate for damage-free drilling was established for the two composite material types: aramid and carbon fiberreinforced polymer laminates. Independent measurements of the opening-mode delamination crack energy release rates were conducted on both materials to determine the critical thrust force for damage initiation. This study establishes the key process stages exhibited by carbon and  aramid fiber composites during drilling, the critical threshold feed rates to avoid damage, and machining relations that can be utilized for the design of intelligent controllers for efficient drilling of composite laminates",

To estimate the effect of extreme environment on creep behavior of carbon fiber/epoxy laminates, specimens are absorbed in the distilled water for 24 hrs at 90°C, frozen for 24 hrs at -16°C in refrigerator. The water absorbed and frozen specimens are tested under 3-point loading at various temperature.

To achieve these properties, a strong bond must exist between the ceramic and CMC layers; otherwise, delamination will occur readily between the layers, The present study focuses on the delamination resistance of such laminates at ambient and elevated temperatures, The delamination resistance of interfaces that have been subjected to mixed-mode loading has been measured for two different hybrid composites by using edge-notched flexure specimens, At low temperatures, delamination occurs by a process that involves multiple matrix cracking within the CMC layers normal to the fibers, followed by cracking of the matrix parallel to the fibers at or near the ceramic/CMC interface, The corresponding fracture energies are typically in the range of similar to 100-300 J/m(2)-comparable to the delamination resistance of the CMC itself, At elevated temperatures, delamination occurs via cavitation and rupture of the matrix within the CMC layers at or near the ceramic/CMC interface, with an attendant loss in toughness (to similar to 10-30 J/m(2)). The loss in toughness occurs most rapidly at temperatures that are close to the strain point of the matrix phase; this represents the life-limiting temperature for this class of composites.",

In engineering practice, there are many situations in which structures undergo impact or dynamic loading. In particular, the impact response of concrete beams strengthened with composite materials is of interest. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation conducted to study the impact effects on concrete beams strengthened with fiber- reinforced polymer laminates. Two types of composite laminates, carbon and Kevlar, were bonded to the top and bottom faces of concrete beams with epoxy. Five beams were tested: two strengthened with Kevlar laminates, two strengthened with carbon laminates, and one unretrofitted beam as the control specimen. The impact load was applied by dropping a steel cylinder from a specified height onto the top face of the beam. The test results revealed that composite laminates significantly increased the capacity of the concrete beams to resist impact load. In addition, the laminates reduced the deflection and crack width. Comparing the test results of the beams strengthened with Kevlar and carbon laminates indicated that the gain in strength depends on the type, thickness, weight, and material properties of the composite laminate.",

The reflection spectra from the FBG sensor were measured at various delamination lengths through four-point bending test. The form of the spectrum changed sensitively, as the delamination length increased. Moreover, the spectrum was calculated theoretically for confirmation of the measured spectrum. The calculated result reproduced the change in the measured spectrum very well.

This paper presents an experimental study of using carbon nanofibers (CNF) to improve the interlaminar fracture properties of polyester/glass fiber composites. Surfactant-treated CNF were dispersed in polyester resin and then the CNF-resin suspension was infused to impregnate a glass fiber preform using vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM). The manufacturability of using VARTM for thick and large CNF toughened composite parts has been experimentally investigated. The influence of CNF concentration on the CNF filtration in the glass fiber preform, the resin viscosity, and the micro-void formation has been examined. By choosing appropriate manufacturing parameters, we were able to use VARTM process to infuse the surfactant-treated CNF/resin matrix into the glass fiber preform and successfully manufactured the CNF toughened polyester/glass fiber composite specimens for mode-I delamination tests. The critical energy release rates of mode-I delamination (GIC) were characterized for several composite specimens with 1 wt% CNF concentrations and for those with pure resin. Significant improvement in the GIC was consistently observed as 1 wt% CNF were added to toughen the polyester resin. Microscopy pictures showed that the fracture surfaces of the 1 wt% CNF toughened polyester/glass fiber composite samples were more complex than the fracture surfaces of regular polyester/glass fiber composites. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A finite element model was developed using thick-layered shell elements to model the composite laminates and non-linear interface elements to simulate the through thickness reinforcements. An existing micro-mechanical solution was employed to model the material behaviour of the interface element. The numerical analysis showed that z-fibre pinning were effective in bridging delamination when damage had propagated into the z-fibre field; these pins provided crack closure forces that shielded the delamination crack from the full delaminating force and moment due to applied loads. Therefore, the z-fibre technique significantly improves the crack growth resistance and hence arrests or delays delamination extension. The numerical results were validated against experimental data.

The proposed method was applied to mode I loaded woven roving glass/vinyl ester delaminated composite. The ASTM standard mode I fracture test was conducted to determine the resistance (GIR) as a function of delamination extension. The fatigue onset life test was conducted to determine the threshold energy release rate, GIth. Constant amplitude cyclic opening displacement fatigue test was conducted to establish the delamination growth rate (da/dN) as a function of maximum cyclic energy release rate (GImax).

The technique, which consists of two line scans, is as follows. The first scan measures the arrival times of the transmitted S0 mode along the 0?? direction to detect delamination and evaluate its size. The second scan measures the maximum amplitude of the earliest wave packet in a line, including the longest delamination, to locate its edge. We performed this technique on impacted CFRP cross-ply laminates. A remarkable decrease in the arrival times due to the delamination is detected, and the delamination length can be calculated based on a simple model for Lamb-wave propagation. Furthermore, the delamination edge is located as a sudden decrease in the amplitude. The technique enables detecting the delamination and evaluating its size and location using only the two scans.

The shapes of the buckles have been measured with an optical whole-field measurement technique, while the extension and depth of delaminations was measured several times by ultrasonic C-scanning during testing. It was observed that the delamination growth occurs mainly in transverse direction to the load and that buckles on the backside usually have the same shape as some of the delaminations. This indicates that the buckling which takes place during the compressive part of the load cycle drives delamination growth. In specimens run to the fatique limit, buckling and delamination growth occur only in the outer 2 or 3 layers on the backside while a spicemen that failed before the fatigue limit buckled through the whole specimen. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Composite panels are widely used in aeronautic and aerospace structures due to their high strength/weight ratio. The stiffness and the strength in the thickness direction of laminated composite panels is poor since no fibres are present in that direction and out-of-plane impact loading is considered potentially dangerous, mainly because the damage may be left undetected. Impact loading in composite panels leads to damage with matrix cracking, inter-laminar failure and eventually fibre breakage for higher impact energies. Even when no visible impact damage is observed at the surface on the point of impact, matrix cracking and inter-laminar failure can occur, and the carrying load of the composite laminates is considerably reduced. The greatest reduction in loading is observed in compression due to laminae buckling in the delaminated areas. The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of the damage growth of impacted composite laminates when subjected to compression after impact loading. For this purpose a series of impact and compression after impact tests were carried out on composite laminates made of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin matrix. An instrumented drop-weight-testing machine and modified compression after impact testing equipment were used together with a C-scan ultrasonic device for the damage identification. Four stacking sequences of two different epoxy resins in carbon fibres representative of four different elastic behaviours and with a different number of interfaces were used. Results showed that the delaminated area due to impact loading depends on the number of interfaces between plies. Two buckling failure mechanisms were identified during compression after impact, which are influenced more by the delamination area than by the stacking sequence.",

          "abstract": "Three-dimensional finite element modeling was used to analyze the delamination between the stiffener flange and the skin of a typical pull-off specimen representing a section of a stiffened skin panel. The finite element analysis results were used to calculate the total strain energy release rate and its Mode I, Mode II, and Mode III components along the delamination front through the width of the pull-off specimen. Three-dimensional modeling makes it possible to represent ply-by-ply lamina properties in the model. However, the ply-by-ply approach should not be used for highly angle ply laminates because of the strong transverse effect from adjacent plies. A smeared properties approach is more robust for the strain energy release rate analysis of delamination between ±45-degree angle ply laminates. The three-dimensional analysis indicates that delamination failure between the stiffener flange and the skin is dominated by Mode I and Mode II delamination modes. The three-dimensional analysis predicts delamination growth from the interior of the pull-off specimen width, and higher pull-off load is required to grow the delamination close to the free edges. The delamination initiation load along the interior of the pull-off specimen width does not change with the change of the width of the pull-off specimen. However, the wider specimen has stronger free edge effects than the narrower specimen. The lay-up of the skin and the flange can have significant effect on the delamination initiation load. Stiffening the skin and maintaining the compliant flange will increase the delamination initiation load.",

The energy absorbed during penetration and ballistic limit of the nanocomposite laminates were studied both experimentally and analytically.

Mechanical properties like tensile modulus, stress-strain function, shear modulus, and strain energy release rate were used as input to the analytical model.

Analytical solutions of the relevant governing equations are proposed and closed-form expressions for simple cases, involving pure mode I and mode II components, are provided. Moreover, analytical expressions for mixed mode loading conditions regarding the energy release rate modal components are given in terms of beam stress resultant discontinuities, emphasizing the presence of new terms, absent in the static case, which arise from the inertial description of the composite structure. Comparisons between analytical and numerical results show the accuracy of the proposed formulation. Some applications are developed to point out the influence of the crack front speed, the shear deformability, the inertial contributions on the energy release rate and the corresponding mode partition.

After validation, the model is used to assess the effects of stacking sequence and clamping pressure on the delamination onset loads and surfaces. It is concluded that &quot;blocked&quot; laminates lead to lower delamination onset loads and larger initial delaminated regions. Finger-tight and clamped joints have higher delamination onset loads and smaller initial cracked regions than pin-loaded joints. These results are in agreement with experimental observations, but no significant difference is detected between finger-tight and clamped joints.

Composite materials have advantageous features in strength and stiffness coupled with lightweight compared to the conventional metallic materials. Amongst all machining operations, drilling is the most commonly applied method for generating holes for riveting and fastening the structural assembly. Delamination is one of the serious concerns in drilling holes in composite materials at the bottom surface of the workpiece (drill exit). Quite a few references of the drilling of fiber-reinforced plastics report that the quality of cut is strongly dependent on drilling parameter as well as the drill geometry. Saw drills and core drills produce less delamination than twist drills by distributing the drilling thrust toward the hole periphery. Delamination can be effectively reduced or eliminated by slowing down the feed rate when approaching the exit and by using back-up plates to support and counteract the deflection of the composite laminate leading to exit side delaminations. The use of the back-up does reduce the delamination in practice, which its effects have not been well explained in analytical fashion. This paper predicts the effects of backup plate on delamination in drilling composite materials using saw drill and core drill. The critical drilling thrust force at the onset of delamination is calculated and compared with that without backup. The well known advantage of industrial use of backup can be understood fundamentally by the fact that the threshold thrust force at the onset of delamination is increased making the delamination less induced. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this model, the 9-node Lagrangian element of the Mindlin plate with consideration of large deformation analysis is employed. To analyze the transient response of the laminated plates, a modified Newmark time integration algorithm previously proposed by the authors is adopted here. We also proved that the impact process between a rigid ball and laminated plates is a stiff system, therefore a kind of A(α) stable method has been advocated here to solve the motion equation of the rigid ball. Furthermore, various types of damages including delamination, matrix cracking and fiber breakage, etc. and their mutual influences are modeled and investigated in detail. To overcome the difficulty of numerical oscillation or instability in the analysis of the dynamic contact problem between delaminated layers using the traditional penalty methods, we have employed dynamic spring constraints to simulate the contact effect, which are added to the numerical model by a kind of continuous penalty function. Moreover, an effective technique to calculate the strain energy release rate based on the Mindlin plate model is proposed, which can attain high precision. Finally, some techniques of adaptive analyses have been realized for improving the computational efficiency. Based on this model, a program has been developed for numerically simulating the damage process of cross-ply fiber-reinforced carbon/epoxy composite laminates under low-velocity impact load. In Part II, this numerical model will be verified by comparing with the experimental results. Also the impact damage will be investigated in detail using this numerical approach. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

An experimental database is gathered through the known modified version of the ASTM D2344 short beam test and the results show a surprising proximity of results for the three different fiber architectures for the same composite system. Various finite element analyses were developed using ANSYS?? software, allowing for better insight on the mechanics of delamination in four-point bending, and showed extremely good agreement with the experimental values. The final and most accurate model partially confirmed observations made by other authors, and includes the &#039;skewed&#039; profile of the shear stress through the thickness and its variation along the length, the distribution of the shear stress across the width, the location of delamination initiation and propagation and maximum ILSS and the shear stress contour. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus is on the effect of the fiber bundle size and weave density of the fabric. The twill-weave carbon fabrics are woven from two different fiber bundles, 3K and 12K, with three different weave densities. The carbon fabrics are thus of three types having areal densities between 200 and 600g/m2, and crimp ratios from 0.049 to 0.12. The laminates are manufactured through vacuum infusion process to minimize the effect of voids and poor resin regions. Tensile tests show serious differences in the behavior of the low and high areal density fabrics although the crimp ratio is about the same in some of the laminates. The low density fabric laminates show a linear stress-strain curve up to a sudden rupture of the laminate. The higher density fabric laminates present a stiffness degradation observed in their stress-strain curve which occurs after a plateau region or just a knee behavior. These high density fabric laminates encounter a severe delamination before the final failure. Digital image correlations (DIC) performed in this work show novel changes of the strain distribution before and after the stiffness degradation in the laminates.",

Cohesive elements are introduced along the boundaries of the inner layers and inside the transverse plies to simulate the spontaneous initiation and propagation of transverse matrix cracks and delamination fronts. The analysis is performed within the framework of the finite deformation theory of elasticity to account for the nonlinear stiffening of the thin composite plate and the large rotations which accompany the fracture process. The simulation is dynamic and uses an explicit time stepping scheme. Comparison with existing experiments performed on graphite/epoxy laminates indicates that the cohesive/volumetric finite element scheme is able to capture the complex mechanisms leading to the delamination, including the initial micro-cracking of the matrix, the appearance of critical transverse matrix cracks and the rapid propagation of delamination cracks initiated at the intersections between the critical matrix cracks and the adjacent plies.",

The idea of using specific sensors integrated in the structure for structural real time monitoring (or health monitoring) is now in progress. Carbon-fibre-reinforced polymers (CFRP) are increasingly used as structural parts, especially in the aircraft industry. This work deals with the possibility of detecting in-situ damage in CFRP by the use of DC or AC electrical property measurements. Monotonic tests under post-buckling bending conditions are being performed on cross ply [0/90]s and [90/0]s carbon/epoxy laminates. The monitoring of electrical resistance and capacitance changes, linked to the modifications of the conduction paths in the composite, and occurrence of voids during loading, allowed the detection of damage growth. It seems that DC electrical conduction allows to detect fibre failure, but AC measurements are more suitable for monitoring matrix cracks (delamination, fibre/matrix debonding or transverse cracks). ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To understand the effect of delamination geometry on the compressive behaviour of laminated composite materials, compression tests were carried out on glass-fibre-reinforced plastic (GRP) test specimens containing artificial delaminations of various geometry, created by inserting PTFE film into the laminate during lay-up. Finite-element modelling was also carried out to gain further understanding of the mechanisms of compressive failure. Good agreement between finite-element predictions and experimental measurements were found for the whole range of delamination geometries that were tested. Finite-element and simple closed-form models were also developed for delaminated panels with isotropic properties. This enabled a study of the effect of delamination geometry on compressive failure without the complicating effects of orthotropic material properties. The results of this study can be used to derive a graph of non-dimensional failure load versus non-dimensional failure stress, where the results for any one delamination geometry superimpose on those for all others. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Twelve differently layered laminates were investigated . The fracture energy is deduced from the data according to the compliance method and beam theory. Beam theory is used to analyze the effect of crack propagation direction . The geometry and lay-up sequence of specimens are designed to probe various conditions such as skew· ness parameter and beam volume. Results show that fiber bridging occurred due to non-midplane crack propagation; this causes the difference in fracture energy calculated by both methods.

The large deformation of the material during impact loading is described through an anisotropic plasticity model in total Lagrangian co-ordinates whose coefficients are determined experimentally. The interaction between lamina is analyzed through a contact/interface model. The tensile and shear tractions in zero thickness interface elements, embedded between lamina, are calculated from interface cohesive law. The interface cohesive law describes the evolution of these tractions in terms of normal and tangential displacement jumps and other interface parameters. The compressive traction at the interface is calculated through the impenetrability conditions employed in the contact module. Once the effective displacement jump exceeds a specified critical value, the interface elements are assumed to have failed, i.e., delamination is said to have taken place. Three interface cohesive laws are proposed to describe the delamination process. It is assumed that loading of interface takes place reversibly up to a specified value of the displacement jump followed by irreversible loading beyond this value. This feature represents a partial damage of the interface in the event of unloading. Dynamic delamination in the woven GRP composite is studied through analyses of plate-on-plate impact experiments. The heterogeneity of composite materials leading to wave dispersion and scattering is modeled by considering a layered composition of the GRP plate. Each lamina is assumed to be made of three layers of materials. The middle layer of half the thickness of lamina is considered as GRP and the two end layers of equal thicknesses are considered to be of matrix material, i.e., polyester resin. The possible delamination of the composite material under compressive shock loading is shown to occur due to local shear effects. This is modeled by considering waviness of the interface between lamina. Interfaces with flat as well as two types of wavy structures are analyzed. Analyses are carried out to establish the effect of critical displacement jump, mixed mode coupling parameter employed in interface laws, interface waviness and the effect of interface laws. The response of GRP composite during impact is characterized in terms of the free surface velocity, delamination event vs. time and interface normal and shear stresses. The interface normal and shear stresses are obtained directly from the interface cohesive laws, as well as, by extrapolating continuum stresses from integration points of the neighboring triangular elements to the interface. It is shown that the finite element model predicts the response of the material in confirmation with available experimental results. The wave dispersion and scattering effects are obtained in the form of attenuation of shock stress and free surface velocity. The model predicts partial delamination during compressive shock loading above a certain threshold due to local shear and mode coupling. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

To this end, a unit cell with random fiber distribution is arranged point-symmetrically with respect to cell facet centers and also Y-periodically. By discussing these two fiber arrangements in terms of standard deviations and a radial distribution function, it is demonstrated that the point-symmetric cell arrangement can enhance the randomness of fiber distribution in comparison with the Y-periodic arrangement. Then, on the assumption that the random fiber distribution generated by the point-symmetric cell arrangement prevails on the transverse section in each lamina, the in-plane elastic-viscoplastic deformation of carbon fiber/epoxy laminates is analyzed using a homogenization theory of nonlinear time-dependent composites. The analysis based on the perfectly periodic hexagonal fiber distribution in laminae is additionally performed for comparison. It is thus shown that the transverse randomness of fiber distribution in laminae has negligible influence on the macroscopic elastic-viscoplastic behavior of laminates, though it markedly affects the microscopic distribution of stress and strain. It is also shown that the analysis predicts very well the macroscopic behavior observed in the corresponding experiments. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights rserved.",

X-radiographs were taken for specimens after pre-loading at different stress levels for the purpose of characterizing the failure modes and damage progression inside the composite. Experimental results showed that the bolt clamping force can significantly reduce the notch tensile strength of composite laminates which are prone to fiber-matrix splitting and delamination. A reduction in failure load of up to 20% was observed. Higher clamping pressure resulted in higher reductions of notch strength. However, for bolted joints which failed in a net-tension mode, clamping improved the joint strength regardless of the ply orientation.",

Automatic systems for in-service delamination identifications are desired to improve low reliability. The present study employs an electric resistance change method for delamination detection. Since the method adopts reinforcement carbon fiber itself as sensors for delamination detection, this method does not reduce static or fatigue strength; also, the method is applicable to existing structures. Authors have found that the electric resistance change method with response surfaces is very effective experimentally and analytically. However, a large error of estimation remains for estimation of delamination location. In the present study, a new data processing procedure is proposed to improve performance of estimations of delamination location. The new method is applied to laminated composite beams. A delamination crack of a laminated composite beam is monitored with the new method using FEM analyses. As a result, the method reveals excellent performance of estimations of delamination location even for new data not used in regression equations. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The burst pressure of composite vessels for different layer structures is predicted using finite element analysis. In the reliability analysis, two design parameters for composite vessels: the radius of polar axis and the winding thickness of each composite layer at the cylinder are assumed to obey the uniform distribution and Gaussian distribution respectively, and the burst pressure of composite vessels is taken as the random output response. Effects of the number of sampling and the limit strength on the strength reliability of composite vessels are explored. Besides, the numerical results obtained using two methods and two distributions for two random input parameters are compared in terms of the calculation efficiency and accuracy. Numerical results also indicate the proposed probability method exhibits preferable advantage over the conventional design method merely using empirical safety coefficient. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the results of extensive experimental work on damage of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates due to low-velocity impact are presented. The study was carried out on 10 different layups over four different thickness. Both drop-weight and projectile impacts simulating practical conditions like tool-drop and runway debris, respectively, were carried out at energy levels varying from 3 to 30 J. The ensuing delamination damage was determined by ultrasonic: C-scans using the pulse-echo immersion method for both projected and layer-wise distribution. While projected delamination was obtained by placing a gate over the backwall echo, layerwise distribution was obtained by successive time delay from the frontwall to the backwall echo covering each interface. Delamination areas were quantified accurately by processing the raw image data using a digital image processing technique. Based on the data obtained an empirical relation was established between the delamination area and the impact energy.",

The thickness size effect in the strength of open-hole composite laminates failed by pull-out is accurately predicted for the first time by a deterministic model.

The P-S-N diagram was produced based upon the fatigue test results, which was conducted on the satin woven glass fabric/polyester laminate. The dependences of fatigue life and its dispersion on the applied stress level and fatigue frequency are discussed. The failure mode under fatigue loading mainly consisted of three kinds: the fiber breakage, matrix cracking and interlaminar delamination, which clearly depends upon the stress level, in other words, fatigue life region. The test results indicated that the wider scatter of the experimental data has been observed in the life range of 105-106 cycles. This characteristic can be well explained by the fact that there exist several dominant failure modes including delamination damage in this life region. The tension fatigue test results conducted on quasi-isotropic carbon/epoxy laminates, [0/??45/90]S, revealed that the dominant fatigue failure mode is a progressive delamination damage at -45/90 interlayer.

Analytical models for the collapse of the composite cores by Euler bucking, delamination failure and micro-buckling of the struts have been developed. Good agreement between the measurements and predictions based on the Euler buckling and delamination failure of the struts is obtained. The micro-buckling analysis indicates this mechanism of failure is not activated until delamination is suppressed.

Laminates produced with carbon fiber/epoxy resin unidirectional prepreg have been produced with an intentionally high void content. Short beam shear, three-point flexure, and tensile testing are used for mechanical evaluation and the results correlate to void volume fraction and ultrasonic absorption coefficient. The ultrasonic absorption coefficient is measured for all the specimens and its variation is approximately linear with the void content, corroborating previous experimental results.

While drilling on composite/metal stacks has been investigated, the drilling of GLARE, which consists of several alternate thin layers of aluminium and composites, has not been addressed separately in the open literature. The focus of present experimental work is to understand the cutting mechanism and relative effect of cutting parameters and tool geometry on the delamination and burr formation during drilling of GLARE. Thrust force, torque and acoustic emission (AE) signals were acquired for analyzing the cutting mechanism, burr and delamination formation. Also, several measurements of burrs, delamination and hole size were taken in order to understand the hole quality. It has been observed that, 2-fluted drill is the best out of four different geometries used, giving zero delamination and acceptable burr formation followed by the 4-faceted drills. The conventional 3-fluted and 8-faceted drills that are otherwise superior for drilling of fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) composites, performed poorly in drilling of the GLARE laminates. Analyzing the processing parameters, feed again has a dominant role in controlling delamination and burr formation than speed.",

          "abstract": "Delamination is the most frequent failure mode in laminated composite materials and it may cause catastrophic failure in critical engineering structures. One of the ways to prevent this failure is to toughen the crack against initiation and propagation. There is lack of studies in literature for toughening the delamination using nanofibers, especially in the case of fatigue behavior. Therefore, the present work aims to investigate effect of interleaved nanofiber mat on fatigue interlaminar properties of mode I delamination in carbon-epoxy composite laminates. To reach this aim, the electrospun polyamide nanofiber fabrics were put in the mid-plane of woven carbon/epoxy laminates. Then the fatigue Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) tests were performed on both virgin and nanomodified specimens, based on ASTM D6115. The experimental results show that the interlaminar fracture toughness and delamination onset fatigue life of the specimens can be substantially improved by addition of the Polyamide nanofiber interlayer. As a matter of fact, there is negligible increase in the thickness of the specimens, less than 1%, but there is noticeable out-plane mechanical properties increase of the modified specimens. The increases in the delamination toughness are up to 150%, at the static tests, and around 100% at the high cycle fatigue loading conditions. Crack paths were investigated by micrograph analysis and different behaviors in the virgin and nano-modified ones were observed and related to the different mechanical results.",

This paper presents a procedure based on a finite element formulation that can be used to perform numerical predictions of the impact induced internal damage in composite laminates. The procedure is based on simulating the composite performance using a micro-mechanical approach named matrix-reinforced mixing theory, a simplified version of the serial/parallel mixing theory that does not require neither the iterative procedure nor the calculation of the tangent stiffness tensor. The numerical formulation uses continuum mechanics to simulate the phenomenon of initiation and propagation of interlaminar damage with no need to formulate interface elements, resulting in a computationally less demanding formulation. To demonstrate the capability of numerical procedure when applied to a low-velocity impact problem, numerical results are compared with the experimental ones obtained in a test campaign performed on 44 laminates specimens subjected to an out-of-plane and concentrated impact event, according to ASTM test method. Results are in good agreement with experimental data in terms of delamination onset and the internal spatial distribution of induced damage. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Delamination is a well-recognized problem associated with drilling fiber-reinforced composite materials (FRCMs). The most noted problems occur as the drill enters and exits the FRCM. Since drilling is often a final operation during assembly, any defects introduced in parts through the drilling process that result in the part being rejected represent an expensive loss. Studies based on linear-elastic fracture mechanics theory have proposed critical cutting and thrust forces in the various drilling regions that can be used as a guide in preventing crack growth or delamination. Using these critical force curves as a guide, a thrust force controller was developed to minimize the delamination while drilling a graphite-epoxy laminate. A neural network control scheme was implemented which required a neural network identifier to model the drilling dynamics and a neural network controller to learn the relationship between feed rate and the desired thrust force. Experimental results verifying the validity of this control approach as well as the robustness of the design are presented. Visual measurements of the delamination zones were used to quantify the benefits of the thrust force controlled drilling process versus the conventional constant feed rate drilling process.

Through-thickness reinforcement in the form of transverse stitching is an effective way to suppress delamination in these composite laminates. In this paper, the effect of stitching on Mode II delamination toughness is analysed by using two specimen geometries, namely, the end-notch flexure (ENF) specimen geometry and the end-notch cantilever (ENC) specimen geometry. The ENC specimen geometry allows larger crack propagation lengths which may be necessary to develop fully the stitch-thread bridging zone in the case of compliant stitch threads. Initially the energy release rate, GII(??a), is determined by the contour integral method and then the use and equivalence of the stress intensity factor approach is demonstrated. The effect of stitching on both specimen geometries is found to be the same, and identical closed form analytical expressions are obtained for the potential energy release rate, GIIR(??a), required for crack propagation. The effect of stitching is expressed in terms of the stitching parameters ?? and ??. The influence of friction between the crack surfaces is also included in the analysis. A simple design study for sizing the ENF and ENC specimens to minimise geometric non-linear response is presented. The effects of the stitching parameters and various geometric and material properties are examined. ?? 1995.",

The out-of-plane impact loading is considered potentially dangerous mainly because the damage may be left undetected and because the loading itself acts in the through-the-thickness direction of the laminated composite panel. This direction is the weakest in the composite since no fibres are present in that direction. The impact loading can lead to damage involving three modes of failure: matrix cracking, delamination and eventually fibre breakage for higher impact energies. Even when no visible impact damage is observed at the surface on the point of impact, matrix cracking and delamination can occur, and the residual strength of the composite is considerably reduced. The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of the damage growth of impacted composite laminates when subjected to impact loading. For this purpose a series of impact tests were carried out on composite laminates made of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin matrix. An instrumented drop-weight-testing was used together with a C-scan ultrasonic device for the damage identification. Two stacking sequences of two different epoxy resins and carbon fibres, representative of four different elastic behaviours with a different number of interfaces were used. A numerical evaluation of these specimens was also carried out, using static analysis only. Results showed that the delaminated area due to impact loading depends on the number of interfaces between plies. Two failure mechanisms due to impact were identified, which are influenced by the stacking sequence and by the thickness of the panels.",

These sheets were made of vapor grown carbon nanofibers. The composite laminates consisted of eight plies of CNS and eight plies of glass fiber mats. The fire retarding performance of the laminates was evaluated with cone calorimeter tests with an external radiated heat flux of 50 kW / m2. The test results indicated that there was significant improvement in the fire retardancy of composite laminates due to the incorporation of CNS. It was found that the CNS plies survived the test except the one on the top surface of the laminates. The formation of compact char materials was observed on the surface of the CNS residues. The improvement in fire retarding performance was achieved through the barrier and insulator effects of the CNS and charred materials by restricting the migration of flammable products to the top surface of the laminates and preventing the transmission of external heat to the underlying polyester resin. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

To ensure the low cost of applying fibre-reinforced materials in automotive vehicles, it is proposed to selectively incorporate carbon fibres to enhance glass fibre composites along main loading path. This paper investigates the influences of stacking sequence of on the strength of hybrid composites comprising materials with differing stiffness and strength. Hybrid composite laminates were manufactured using varying ratio of glass woven fabric and carbon woven fabric in an epoxy matrix. Static tests including tension, compression and three-point-bending were carried out to composite coupons containing various ratios of carbon fibres to glass fibres. The results show that hybrid composite laminates with 50% carbon fibre reinforcement provide the best flexural properties when the carbon layers are at the exterior, while the alternating carbon/glass lay-up provides the highest compressive strength. The tensile strength is insensitive to the stacking sequence. Analytical solutions are also developed and are shown to provide good correlation with the experimental data, which allow the optimisation of stacking sequence of hybrid composites to achieve the maximum strength. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The constitutive model is based on the assumption that the composite material is transversely isotropic, and accounts for the effects of crack closure under load reversal cycles. The damage model is implemented in an implicit finite element code taking into account the requirement to ensure a mesh-independent computation of the dissipated energy. The comparison between the model predictions and published experimental data indicates that the model can accurately predict the effects of transverse matrix cracks on the residual stiffness of quasi-isotropic laminates, the interaction between transverse matrix cracks and delamination, and final failure of the laminate.",

In an effort to further understand the impact response of composite laminates, various degrees of impact ranging from subperforation to perforation were introduced to glass/epoxy laminates through an instrumented drop-weight impactor. In addition, composite laminates of various in-plane dimensions and thicknesses were examined for in-plane dimensional and thickness effects, respectively. Experimental results showed that in-plane dimensional effect was not as significant as thickness effect. The impacted composite laminates were then subjected to compression after impact (CAI) tests for characterizations of residual mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that perforation was the most important damage stage in composite laminates subjected to impact loading since impact characteristics (peak force, contact duration and absorbed energy) and mechanical properties degradation (residual compressive maximum force and residual compressive absorbed energy) of composite laminates became stable once perforation took place. However, it was also found that delamination played a very important role in the characterizations of mechanical properties degradation. Since the impact response of composite laminates is due to plate bending to some extent, bending analysis was used to explain the greater influence of thickness effect to in-plane dimensional effect. It was also found that bending analysis was feasible for interpretation of delamination in mechanical properties degradation.",

          "abstract": "Demand for advanced engineering composites in the aerospace industry is increasing continuously. Lately, carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRPs) became one of the most important structural materials in the industry due to a combination of characteristics such as: excellent stiffness, high strength-to-weight ratio, and ease of manufacture according to application. In service, aerospace composite components and structures are exposed to various transient loads, some of which can propagate in them as cyclic impacts. A typical example is an effect of the wind gusts during flight. This type of loading is known as impact fatigue (IF); it is a repetition of low-energy impacts. Such loads can cause various types of damage in composites: fibre breaking, transverse matrix cracking, de-bonding between fibres and matrix and delamination resulting in reduction of residual stiffness and loss of functionality. Furthermore, this damage is often sub-surface, which reinforces the need for more regular inspection. The effects of IF are of major importance due its detrimental effect on the structural integrity of components that can be generated after relatively few impacts at low force levels compared to those in a standard fatigue regime. This study utilises an innovative testing system with the capability of subjecting specimens to a series of repetitive impacts. The primary subject of this paper is to assess the damaging effect of IF on the behaviour of drilled CFRP specimens, exposed to such loading. A detailed damage analysis is implemented utilising an X-ray micro computed tomography system. The main findings suggested that at early stages of life damage is governed by o degree splits along the length of the specimens resulting in a 20% reduction of stiffness. The final failure damage scenario indicated that transverse crasks in the 90 degree plies are the main reason for complete delamination which can be translated to a 50% stiffness reduction. © 2011 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In ZnO/woven carbon fiber composite laminates, the interlaminar region, composed of ZnO nanostructured arrays embedded on woven carbon fiber sheets, interacts with the thermoset vinyl ester resin. ZnO nanostructured arrays were formed into nanorods (NRs) using a hydrothermal process. To investigate the electrical resistive heating behavior of the interlaminar region, we analyzed the temperature profile as a function of time in three zones: a heating zone, a maximum temperature zone, and a cooling zone. The morphology of the ZnO NRs was investigated using scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis was used to characterize the crystallinity and ZnO concentration. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to analyze the specific heat capacity of ZnO/woven carbon fiber composite laminates. Electrical resistive heating was achieved in the interlaminar region through multiple junctions formed between the intrinsic woven carbon fiber tows and among the ZnO NRs. The contribution of the ZnO NRs to the thermal heat gain was interconnected with the woven carbon fiber and resin in the interlaminar regions. The interlaminar resistance between the upper and lower laminas of ZnO/woven carbon fiber composites increased with incremental increases in the ZnO concentration up to 110. mM. This effect was due to the interlaminar interface and the high surface density of ZnO NRs, which inhibit electron transport into the woven carbon fibers. Resistance decreased following electrical resistive heating due to an increase in the density of free electrons at high temperatures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

The damaged samples were carefully examined with respect to failure modes. Major mechanisms of the deformation and damage processes were modelled on the basis of energy absorption, including global plate deflection, fiber, breakage, delamination and bending of petals, hole enlargement and friction between striker and sample. For the dynamic case, the predictions were 70-96% of the observed expenditure level. This is considered to be due to the absence in the analysis of factors such as inertia, strain-rate and wave propagation effects, matrix shearing and fragmentation, as well as obliquity and rotation motion of the striker. The correspondence in the case of static loading was considerably poorer, indicating substantial and non-measurable energy absorption by the test apparatus, including substantial frictional dissipation in in the specimen holder and between sample and penetrator. ?? 1994.",

Microscopic analysis of the damaged specimens revealed that the current 3D weaving scheme creates inherently two weak planes which act as potential sites for delamination in the above experiments. It is concluded that while the z-yarns may be effective in limiting the delamination damage at low loads and at low rates of impact, at high loads and high loading rates delamination continues to be the dominant failure mode in 3D woven composites. It is shown that dynamic indentation can be used to capture the progression of damage during impact of 3D woven composites. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

Three E-glass fabrics, non-crimp fabric, woven fabric, and nonwoven mat, were selected as reinforcements for the composite laminates. Impact tests were conducted using a guided drop-weight test rig in ascending energy to 24 J/layer nominal impact energy. Metallographic microscopy was used to observe the damage characteristics of the perpendicular cross-section of the impacted laminates after a micropowder polishing treatment. When the load–time and the energy–time histories were compared with the fractographics, it was found that fiber breakage had occurred prior to the major damage. When the impact energy increased over the threshold energy of the major damage, matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber breakage were observed at the back surface, below a nearly undamaged zone, which were attributed to the bending stresses.",

The carbon fiber reinforced plastic nanocomposite laminates were prepared and drilling experiments were carried out in the laminates using solid carbide drills of diameter 6 mm. The input parameters considered were cutting speed, feed, and wt% carbon nanofiber present in carbon fiber reinforced plastic nanocomposite laminates. A three level test for each parameter was conducted using L27 orthogonal array. The output response measured were acoustic emission characteristics such as root mean square of the signal, rise time, counts, energy, duration, peak amplitude, counts to peak, hits, average frequency, delamination, thrust force, and torque. The monitored parameters were analyzed and concluded that it is enough to monitor root mean square of the acoustic emission signal alone since all the other acoustic emission parameters are very closely related to acoustic emission root mean square. Monitoring the drilling of carbon fiber reinforced plastic nanocomposite laminates using acoustic emission is presented in this article which has not been reported so far.",

The quality of the developed multiscale laminates was evaluated by non-destructive inspection techniques (ultrasonic C-scan and thermography), density measurements as well as optical and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The in-plane and transverse thermal and electrical conductivities as well as Short-Beam-Shear (SBS) strength were measured at different locations within each composite panel. It was found that the addition of SWCNT can have a considerable influence on the porosity of manufactured laminates. In summary, while unwrapped SWCNT generally improved the thermal and electrical properties of the PEEK/GF laminates, composites incorporating compatibilizer exhibited the lowest porosity, the highest electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

First, ultrasonic wavefield is obtained from a target structure by scanning a Nd:YAG pulse laser beam for ultrasonic wave generation and measuring the corresponding ultrasonic responses using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Then, hidden damages are identified and visualized through adoption of a standing wave filter, which can isolate damage-induced standing waves from the obtained wavefield. The proposed technique has following advantages over the existing techniques: (1) it does not require any sensor installation; (2) it is noninvasive, rapidly deployable and applicable to harsh environments; and (3) it can visualize damage with high spatial resolution without any baseline data, which enables automated and intuitive damage diagnosis. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated by visualizing a debonding in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic aircraft wing and a delamination in a glass fiber reinforced plastic wind turbine blade. Furthermore, the effects of temperature and static loading variations on the proposed technique are also examined. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

A &quot;shear-lag&quot; damage analysis, using the nonlinear correspondence principle and appropriate failure criteria, is carried out to numerically predict the cracking evolution. This work shows that, though important, the material nonlinearity of the undamaged material does not significantly enhance the loading rate sensitivity of the cracking process and it cannot explain alone the phenomenon. On the other hand, taking into account the loading rate dependence of the critical strength, together with the R-curve effect, which gives good predicted cracking curves, suggests that the observed rate effect pertains to the viscoelastic character of the damaged material in the process zone close to crack fronts. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5% in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "A delamination monitoring method was proposed to characterize Mode I and Mode II delamination onset in carbon fiber/epoxy (CF/EP) composite laminates through interrogation of guided waves activated and captured using piezoelectric actuators and sensors in a pitch-catch configuration. Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture tests were conducted using double cantilever beam (DCB) and end notch flexure (ENF) specimens to evaluate the proposed method. The changes in wave propagation velocity and wave magnitude (or attenuation), and the degree of waveform similarity between excitation and response signals, were calculated as delamination-sensitive wave parameters and plotted versus displacement recorded using a materials testing system. The kink points determined from wave parameter-displacement curves agreed well with the deviation from linearity (NL), visual observation (VIS) and maximum load (Max) points, which are often used in conventional methods for determining interlaminar fracture toughness. The propagation characteristics of the A 0 wave mode in a low frequency range were demonstrated to have high sensitivity to Mode I and in particular Mode II delamination onset in CF/EP composite laminates. It was concluded that the guided waves propagating in the DCB and ENF specimens were capable of determining Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture toughness, complementing current practices based on visual inspection or trivial interrogation using load-displacement curve alone. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The FMLs were based on an aluminum alloy, a self-reinforced polypropylene composite and a polypropylene film acting as an interlayer adhesive. The investigation focuses on the feasibility of using scale models to predict the full-scale behavior of laminates based on [Aln, 0??/90??n]s and [Aln, ??45??n]s stacking configurations. Tensile tests were undertaken on laminates that were prepared using three different scaling approaches, these being 1D (scaling the thickness dimension), 2D (scaling the in-plane dimensions) and 3D scaling where all of the dimensions were scaled appropriately. Geometrical effects were investigated by monitoring the stiffness, strength, strain to failure and the stress/strain response of the FMLs. In the 1D and 3D-scaled samples, a small decrease in tensile strength was observed with increasing scale size, an effect that was associated with a change in failure mode from tensile fracture to interply delamination. In contrast, the strength of the 2D-scaled samples increased with increasing scale size, an effect that was attributed to the decreasing influence of edge delaminations in the larger test samples. The elastic modulus of the fiber-metal laminates did not exhibit any scale effect, remaining roughly constant over the four sizes of specimen considered here. ?? 2006.",

Based on the results of 3D FE analysis, GI, GI, and GI,, have been calculated at the delamination front using Irwin&#039;s Crack Closer Integral. It has been observed that the delamination initiation is a mixed mode phenomenon even in the case of uniaxial loading.

Correlations are established between resistance to and tolerance of impact damage and the delamination resistance of composites.

          "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the analysis of elastic waves generated by localized dynamic sources in structural composites. The source can be external, involving acoustic wave loading as in the so called leaky Lamb wave experiment, and low-velocity foreign object impact on the surface of the structure, or internal, as in sudden crack initiation and its rapid growth from existing internal flaws. All three problems are of critical importance in the safe operation of composite structures, due to their vulnerability to hidden delaminations that can occur in composite materials when they are subjected to this type of loads. It is well known that both the dynamic surface loading associated with impact, and the sudden &quot;opening&quot; of an internal crack associated with the extension of a preexisting flaw act as sources of elastic waves in the material of the structure. The research reported here consists of model-based analysis of the guided waves generated by surface loading and microcrack initiation in graphite epoxy composite laminates commonly used in aircraft and aerospace structures. The objective of this study is to develop a mechanics based understanding of the causal relationship between the properties of the source and the characteristics of the waves generated by its initiation and propagation. The results of this research are expected to be useful in developing effective health monitoring systems for new as well as aging aircraft and aerospace structures. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It represents one contribution (called Part A of the Exercise) to the exercise, where predictions for laminate response and the failure behavior of various laminates, such as specific carbon- and glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy laminates under a broad range of loading conditions are made. The chapter describes a method for predicting the nonlinear stress/strain response and the failure behavior of composite laminates. Predictions are based on an incremental formulation of a well established three-dimensional laminated media analysis coupled with a progressive-ply failure methodology. Nonlinear lamina constitutive relations for the composites are represented using the Ramberg-Osgood equation. Piece-wise linear increments in laminate stress and strain are calculated and superimposed to formulate the overall effective nonlinear response. Individual ply stresses and strains are monitored to calculate instantaneous ply stiffnesses for the incremental solution and to establish ply failure levels. The progressive-ply failure approach allows for stress unloading in a ply and discrimination of the various potential modes of failure. The chapter presents laminate response and failure predictions for 14 different cases. The cases include prediction of the effective nonlinear stress vs. strain responses of laminates and initial and final ply failure envelope predictions under multiaxial loading.",

The effect of matrix cracking on delamination propagation was the primary focus of the study. For simplicity&#039;s sake, only cross-ply laminates were investigated. An analytical model was proposed for determining the response of the laminates containing a matrix crack-induced delamination and subjected to a concentrated load through a spherical indenter. Two types of matrix cracks were considered in the model: a surface-bending crack and an internal shear crack. The model consists of three parts: a stress analysis, a contact analysis, and a failure analysis. A nonlinear three-dimensional finite element model based on an updated Lagrange formulation was developed for calculating stresses and strains in composites. An augmented Lagrangian method was utilized to simulate the interfacial contact condition of the embedded delamination and the indentation between the composite and the indenter. Fracture mechanics was applied to predict the delamination growth in three dimensions. In order to verify the model, results of the calculations from the analysis were compared with the existing solutions and test data available in the literature. Experiments were also conducted to further substantiate the model and the predictions from the analysis. Overall, the predictions agreed well with the existing solutions and the test data.",

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0degrees/90degrees] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies.

However, each layup had different percentages of crack-opening and shear-mode strain-energy-release rates, GI and GII, respectively. Results with composites made from T300 graphite fibers and 5208 epoxy, a brittle resin, indicated that only GI contributed to delamination onset under static loading. However, results with composites made from C6000 fibers and H205 epoxy, a tougher resin, indicated that the total G governed the onset of edge delaminations under cyclic loads. In addition, for both materials, the threshold level of G for delamination onset in fatigue was significantly less than the critical Gc measured in static tests. Furthermore, although the C6000/H205 material had a much higher static Gc than T300/5208, its fatigue resistance was only slightly better.

          "abstract": "Drilling of carbon fibre/epoxy laminates is usually carried out using standard drills. However, it is necessary to adapt the processes and/or tooling as the risk of delamination, or other damages, is high. These problems can affect mechanical properties of produced parts, therefore, lower reliability. In this paper, four different drills - three commercial and a special step (prototype) - are compared in terms of thrust force during drilling and delamination. In order to evaluate damage, enhanced radiography is applied. The resulting images were then computational processed using a previously developed image processing and analysis platform. Results show that the prototype drill had encouraging results in terms of maximum thrust force and delamination reduction. Furthermore, it is possible to state that a correct choice of drill geometry, particularly the use of a pilot hole, a conservative cutting speed - 53 m/min - and a low feed rate - 0.025 mm/rev - can help to prevent delamination. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The distribution of the local strain energy release rate along the delamination front is obtained via the virtual crack closure technique applied to three-dimensional (3D) finite element models of circular delaminations embedded in woven and nonwoven composite laminates. In each case, the delamination is embedded at a different depth along the thickness direction of the laminates. The fibre orientation of the plies bounding the delamination significantly influences the distribution of the local strain energy release rate. There is general qualitative agreement between the predicted directions of delamination growth and C-scan results of the embedded delaminations. It is found that residual thermal stresses have a significant effect on the onset of buckling of the delaminated sublaminate, but negligible influence on the distribution of the local strain energy release rate in the postbuckled regime. Furthermore, the effect of residual thermal stresses is more pronounced for delaminations that are closer to the surface. A method for the prediction of delamination areas and directions using fatigue growth criteria derived from test coupon data is also presented. It is found that growth criteria based on components of the strain energy release rate predict the rate of delamination growth much better than those based on the total strain energy release rate.",

Although many scientists have investigated the energy absorption characteristics in various continuous fiber reinforced composite materials and their dependence on strain rate, there is very little literature available on the energy absorption and crushing characteristics of random chopped fiber reinforced composite materials and their strain rate dependence. Therefore, the primary goal was to determine the crashworthiness of various random chopped carbon fiber composite material systems. To meet this goal, first an experimental set up was developed for discerning the deformation behavior and damage mechanisms that oc- cur during the progressive crushing of composite materials. The three different random chopped carbon reinforced ep- oxy composite material systems studied were P4, HexMC, and CCS100. Quasi-static progressive crush tests were then performed on these random chopped carbon fiber composite plates to determine their crashworthiness. In addition, an attempt was made to investigate and characterize the strain rate effects on the energy absorption of a random chopped carbon fiber P4 composite. The specific energy absorption was found to increase with increasing loading rate from 15.2 to 762 cm/min.",

          "abstract": "The global behavior of composite materials is strongly influenced by the quality of adhesion between different components. A component can be single phase, like fibers or particles used as reinforcement in a homogenous matrix, or a multiphase material like a layer in long-fiber laminate. In the latter case the degradation of adhesion implies the separation of the layers, known as delamination. Among all different failure mechanisms, &#039;Delamination&#039; is considered to be the most prominent mode of failure in fiber-reinforced laminates as a result of their relatively weak inter-laminar strength. When laminated structures are subjected to static, dynamic or cyclic loadings, the inter-laminar adhesion strength between individual plies tends to deteriorate significantly and act as the origin of the final failure. Therefore, an efficient and reliable design tool capable of predicting delamination could improve the durability for composite laminates. There exist damage mechanics based formulations capable of simulating the delamination crack growth in carbon/glass fiber epoxy based composite laminates. The present study is focused on taking a step forward in this respect. At first, already existed local interface model&#039;s effectiveness is tested and results are successfully compared with available experimental data for UD IMS/924 Carbon/fiber epoxy composite laminate. Next, a non-local integral-type regularization scheme is introduced to overcome the spurious localization problem associated to the existing local model. Basic concepts and mathematical modeling of Non-Local damage evolution law are comprehensively studied and presented in this study. Finite Element simulation results based on proposed model are discussed in detail and are compared with experimental results.",

A three-dimensional finite element program was developed to calculate the interlaminar stresses. In order to simplify the numerical analysis, an interfacial layer was embedded in between the composite laminae. A penny-shape delamination was introduced at the center of the composite laminates and was assumed to have very low modulus to avoid the penetration between delaminated surfaces due to central loading. Based on the three-dimensional finite element analysis, the strain energy release rates at the delamination front were calculated. Because the interlaminar normal stresses were negative in the interfaces, there was no mode I failure in central loading. Numerical results also revealed that GII was higher than GIII in most cases examined. In addition, GII in the fiber direction of the composite lamina beneath the interfacial layer was significantly higher than that in the matrix direction. This result indicated the nature of non-self-similar delamination initiation which was believed to result in the anisotropic delamination in the composite laminates subjected to central loading.",

Initial attention focused on investigating the effect of varying the fibre orientation, ??, on the tensile modulus and strength of a range of [Ti, ????]s carbon-fibre/PEEK FMLs. Here, as expected, increasing the offset angle, ??, resulted in a decrease in the tensile properties of the FMLs. The failure mechanisms in the hybrid laminates were investigated through a series of cyclic tensile tests on a number of edge-polished samples. An examination of the specimen edges indicated that failure in laminates whose fibres were oriented at angles between 0?? and 15?? occurred as a result of fracture of individual carbon fibres. At offset angles greater than 15??, initial failure took the form of localised debonding at the fibre-matrix interface. In addition to this debonding, laminates with values of ?? between 15?? and 45?? exhibited delamination between the composite plies. First ply failure (FPF) as well as the tensile strength of the FMLs was predicted using a number of simple failure criteria. Here, it was shown that the onset of damage under tensile loading conditions can be successfully predicted over a wide range of offset angles. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Fracture data reduction was achieved by means of time-temperature superposition, the shift factors being obtained from tensile tests.

After impacting thin woven carbon/epoxy laminates using hemispherical, ogival and conical steel impactors all 12 mm in diameter using a drop weight test rig (Mitrevski et al., 2005), various post-impact analysis techniques have been employed, such as non-destructive inspection (NDI) and microscopy to assess the effect of impactor shape on the resulting damage. The blunter hemispherical impactor produced the largest damage area dominated by delamination. The rather sharp conical impactor produced the most fibre breakage which resulted in a localised damage area and the largest indentation/penetration depth. A significant reduction in tensile strength was found for all specimens. The specimens impacted by the hemispherical impactor at 4 J experienced a slightly higher residual tensile strength due to the barely visible impact damage (BVID) induced which was dominated by delamination. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "This study demonstrated that fluorine functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) can be used to reinforce in the midplane of a fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminate for increasing the interlaminar shear fracture toughness. A spraying methodology was used to deposit the f-CNTs on the midplane carbon fabric to produce this through-thickness interlaminar reinforcement. The four-point end notch flexure (4ENF) specimen was used in the experiments to calculate the critical strain energy release rate, GIIc, to quantify a value for fracture toughness. Compared to the neat case (0.0 wt% CNTs) there was a 23% increase in the average initiation and 27% increase in the average propagation GIIc with only 0.5 wt% f-CNTs dispersed on the fabric and in the resin of the midplane region. High resolution microscopic examinations of the specimen fracture surfaces suggest that the functionalized carbon nanotubes are covalent bonding nanoscale tethers between the fibers and the epoxy resin, resulting in toughened fiber-matrix interfacial strengths to achieve these improved through-thickness mechanical properties for this nanocomposite laminate system. This nanotube technology could displace the need for using cross-fabric stitching or pinning, or using thickening interleaf layers at the midplane region of laminates in order to improve the interlaminar shear fracture toughness. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The paper outlines the effects of localised Z-directional reinforcement with Z-Fiber� pins on the balance of mechanical properties in unidirectional and fabric carbon fibre reinforced epoxy matrix composites. The properties under consideration include in-plane stiffness and strength under tensile and shear loading conditions, but the main focus of the paper is on the ability of blocks of Z-pins to resist the propagation of delamination cracking in lab coupon samples and in locally reinforced structural elements. The case of delamination in Z-pinned laminates under Mode I loading conditions is now well understood. The micro- mechanisms of failure are well characterised by single pin pullout experiments and modelling the behaviour of simple structures such as double cantilever beam has proved to be successful. The analysis of structures subjected to Mode II loading conditions, however, is proving to be much more of a challenge. Z-pinning appears effective in tests of standard delamination beams such as 3pt-End Notched Flexure (ENF) beams and 4pt �ENF beams. In particular, the catastrophic failure normally associated with the 3pt-ENF shear loading configuration is suppressed in the pinned samples. The micro-mechanisms of Z-pin deformation and failure involved in Mode II delamination are complex and the delamination resistance is thus observed to be strongly structure geometry dependent. In a low compliance test specimen geometry such as a thick double lap-joint, Z-pinning has been found not to improve the ultimate performance of the structure in static loading, whilst it can still extend the cyclic life of a fully delaminated joint under moderate loading. Recent results raise questions about the true mode mixity in the usual delamination tests and its consequences on the failure behaviour of Z-pinned laminates.",

In order to obtain better mechanical properties, aluminum alloy plates and glass fibers were replaced by magnesium alloy plates and carbon fibers to get carbon fiber-metal laminates based on magnesium alloy. Single cantilever beams were used to examine the influence of loading rate on the interfacial fracture toughness of carbon fiber-metal laminates based on magnesium alloy. The results show that crack propagation is stable at low loading rates whereas unstable at high rates. And loading rates have slight influence on interfacial fracture toughness at low rates range from 1mm/min to 1000mm/min. The fracture toughness at high rates in impact tests is greater than at low rate.",

The analysis adopts a first-order shear deformable layer-wise kinematics for the laminate and an interface model simulating mixed-mode fracture in the presence of a bridged delamination. A penalised interface simulates adhesion between layers and provides energy release rates through its strain energy density while a two-parameter softening interface with a limit displacement models bridging stresses. Delamination evolution analysis is performed by solving the non-linear boundary value problem resulting from a stress analysis coupled with opportune propagation conditions. Numerical examples are presented for composite laminates subjected to both pure mode and mixed-mode loading conditions and the results are compared with those obtained adopting classic delamination models. Analytical formulae for energy release rate evaluation are also proposed to carry out an investigation of the main factors governing accuracy in predicting delamination growth. The proposed approach captures important effects which are not included in classic delamination models. The accuracy of the model is assessed by comparisons with 2D finite element results obtained by using delamination interface elements. The finite element model agrees well with results obtained by using the proposed approach. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Twelve large-scale (4.88 m in length) doubly reinforced concrete beams were strengthened with externally-bonded CFRP sheets and tested.

          "abstract": "Electrospun thermoplastic nanofibres have a large potential for the interlaminar toughening of composite laminates. They can easily be placed in resin rich interlayers between reinforcing plies prior to laminate production and require no dispersion into the matrix resin. Although there are many expected benefits, the research on composite laminates enhanced with electrospun thermoplastic nanofibres is still very limited and a thorough understanding of the toughening mechanism is still missing. This article provides thorough insights into the micromechanisms that lead to the interlaminar toughening of carbon/epoxy composite laminates interleaved with electrospun polyamide nanofibrous veils. The main mechanism leading to a higher interlaminar fracture toughness, both under Mode I and Mode II loading conditions, was the bridging of (micro)cracks by PA nanofibres. The effectiveness of the nanofibre bridging toughening mechanism is dependent on a good load transfer to the nanofibres. Crack propagation under Mode II loading conditions resulted in much higher improvements than under Mode I loading due to an optimal loading of the nanofibres along their fibre direction in the plane of the nanofibrous veil. In Mode I crack propagation, however, the loading of the nanofibres is less optimal and was shown to be dependent on both the primary reinforcement fabric architecture, as well as on the presence of a carbon fibre bridging zone.",

In an effort to further understand the impact response of composite laminates, various degrees of impact ranging from subperforation to perforation were introduced to glass/epoxy laminates through an instrumented drop-weight impactor. In addition, composite laminates of various in-plane dimensions and thicknesses were examined for in-plane dimensional and thickness effects, respectively. Experimental results showed that in-plane dimensional effect was not as significant as thickness effect. The impacted composite laminates were then subjected to compression after impact (CAI) tests for characterizations of residual mechanical properties. Experimental results showed that perforation was the most important damage stage in composite laminates subjected to impact loading since impact characteristics (peak force, contact duration and absorbed energy) and mechanical properties degradation (residual compressive maximum force and residual compressive absorbed energy) of composite laminates became stable once perforation took place. However, it was also found that delamination played a very important role in the characterizations of mechanical properties degradation. Since the impact response of composite laminates is due to plate bending to some extent, bending analysis was used to explain the greater influence of thickness effect to in-plane dimensional effect. It was also found that bending analysis was feasible for interpretation of delamination in mechanical properties degradation.",

The preceding interlaminar shear stress analysis for progressive damage is applied to the present test conditions, in order to obtain stress distributions and strain energy release rate as functions of two damage parameters which are the crack densities in 0?? and 90?? layers of the laminate. Experimental observations of damage evolution have also been carried out in T300/914 carbon/epoxy laminates, during thermal fatigue tests. The influence of temperature amplitude on damage is investigated throughout tests. Damage consists of matrix cracking in both 0?? and 90?? layers, followed by delamination along cracks at the 0??/90?? ply interfaces. It appears that, depending on the temperature amplitude, the damage evolution is either non-existent, rather slow, or very fast. It also appears that the predictions of the analysis are in good agreement with the experimental observations. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Based on these experimental observations, we present a numerical simulation of interlaminar damage propagation, using a cohesive zone model to address the energy-based criterion for damage propagation. This simulation can address the interlaminar delamination with high accuracy by locating a fine mesh near the damage process zone, while maintaining computational efficiency with the use of automatic mesh generation.

          "abstract": "The mesoscale composite damage model (MCDM) and a new component damage indicator are incorporated into a finite element code to predict the initiation and evolution of damage, and then final failure of fibrous composites structure subjected to combined loadings. The veracity of the method is demonstrated through applications to a stiffened, composite panel that is subjected to various combinations of tension, compression, shear and pressure loadings. The stiffened panel is modeled as a structure consisting of web, flange, skin and interface between the flange and the skin. Any other composite structure can be investigated at the pleasure of the investigator, subject to limitations on the computer resources required for the degree of scale desired. A component damage indicator, Dx,C, is defined as the average of the damage variable x, as determined by the MCDM, for each finite element in structural component C. If varying size elements are present in the component, a weighted average is used. When D reaches a value of 1.0, the component has no stiffness and completely lacks structural integrity. Experience indicates that D &gt; 0.4 suggests component failure. An important feature of D is that it permits damage trends in a component to be monitored. Stable damage growth corresponds to a structure with remaining integrity whereas unstable growth is a precursor to structural failure. Selected results are presented for as tiffened panel made from the carbon-epoxy material M55J/M18. It is shown that delamination is the predominate mode of failure for the cases considered and that the load level corresponding to the onset of delamination is a strong function of the type of combined loading. Failure strains are shown to vary by as much as a factor of three depending upon the type of loading. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "An experimental and numerical study of the influence of tensile and compressive preloading on the high velocity impact performance of T800S/M21 carbon/epoxy plates was conducted. Gas gun tests with spherical hard body projectiles were used to generate impact damages under five different states of preloading and five different velocities in the range of 50-90. m/s. Ultrasonic C-scans and micrographs were used for the post-test damage inspection, where matrix cracking and delaminations were observed as the major impact damage modes. Tensile preloading was found to reduce the extent of delaminations, while compressive preload led to an increased extent of delaminations resulting from a higher bending deflection of the plate under impact. State-of-the-art impact simulation methods in Abaqus/Explicit with Hashin failure criteria for the composite material and cohesive elements for delamination interfaces were capable of representing these effects of preloading that were observed in the experiment. This study shows that preloading has an influence on the impact response of laminated composite plates and should be considered in relevant vulnerability analyses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

A classical interface damage evolution law, which is commonly used to predict the static debonding process, is modified further to incorporate fatigue delamination effects due to high cycle loadings. An improved formulation is also presented to incorporate the &#039;R&#039; ratio effects. The proposed fatigue damage model is identified using fracture mechanics tests like double cantilever beam, end-notched-flexure and mixed-mode bending.

          "abstract": "We show that the addition of small volume fractions of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to the matrix of glass-fiber composites reduces cyclic delamination crack propagation rates significantly. In addition, both critical and sub-critical inter-laminar fracture toughness values are increased. These results corroborate recent experimental evidence that the incorporation of CNTs improve fatigue life by a factor of two to three in in-plane cyclic loading. We show that in both the critical and sub-critical cases, the degree of delamination suppression is most pronounced at lower levels of applied cyclic strain energy release rate, ??G. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy of the fracture surfaces suggests that the presence of the CNTs at the delamination crack front slows the propagation of the crack due to crack bridging, nanotube fracture, and nanotube pull-out. Further examination of the sub-critical fracture surfaces shows that the relative proportion of CNT pull-out to CNT fracture is dependent on the applied cyclic strain energy, with pull-out dominating as ??G is reduced. The conditions for crack propagation via matrix cracking and nanotube pull-out and fracture are studied analytically using fracture mechanics theory and the results compared with data from the experiments. It is believed that the shift in the fracture behavior of the CNTs is responsible for the associated increase in the inter-laminar fracture resistance that is observed at lower levels of ??G relative to composites not containing CNTs. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Two different computational strategies are developed: (i) a cohesive model (CM) based on the classical continuum mechanics and (ii) a continuous damage material model (CDM) coupling failure modes and damage. Another mixed methodology (MM) is proposed using the continuous damage model for delamination initiation and the cohesive model for 3D crack propagation and mesh openings.

Experimental results are obtained for a carbon fibre reinforced aluminium laminate (CARE) on the in-plane mechanical properties, notched and post-impact residual strengths, and the effects of fibre–matrix interfacial bond strength and adhesion between metal and fibre composite layers. Microscopy, C-scan, and chemical removal techniques are used to reveal the inter-layer delamination mechanism and the failure behaviour of CARE. A new analytical model for notched residual strength was developed based on a global equilibrium approach. The residual strengths predicted by this model agree well with experimental data of several FRMLs (e.g., CARE and ARALL) containing either a central crack or a circular hole. The effects of metal layer stiffness, fibre types, and fracture toughness of fibre composite layer on notched residual strength are also investigated.

It revealed that matrix cracking, delaminations, tow debonding, and fibre fracture were the prominent damage modes. Three-dimensional finite-element models are developed to study the onset, progression and interaction of some damage modes such as delamination and fabric fracture observed with micro-CT. A damage modelling technique based on a cohesive-zone method, which is more efficient than continuum damage mechanics approach, is proposed for analysis of interaction of damage modes. The developed numerical models are capable to simulate the damage mechanisms and their interaction observed in the tests.

          "abstract": "The present paper discusses the results of an investigation into the effects of test rate and the mode of loading on the fracture energy, G c, of adhesively-bonded fibre-composite joints. Various carbon-fibre reinforced-polymer (CFRP) matrix composite substrates have been bonded using two different types of automotive structural epoxy-adhesives. They have been tested via loading the bonded joints in mode I (tensile), mode II (in-plane shear) and mixed-mode I/II from slow rates (i.e.; of about 10 -5 m/s) up to relatively high rates of test of about 15 m/s. The high-rate tests were photographed using a high-speed digital video camera to record the deformation of the joint and the fracture behaviour. An analysis strategy has been developed for the various modes of loading (i) to account for the observed fracture behaviour, (ii) to circumvent the problems posed by oscillations in the load traces due to the presence of dynamic effects in the faster tests, and (iii) to account for the kinetic energy associated with the moving specimen arms in the faster tests. Based on the analysis strategy developed, the effect of the test rate on the fracture energy, G c, for the different loading modes for the joints has been ascertained. Furthermore, various different fracture paths were observed in the tests. They were either cohesive, in the adhesive layer, or interlaminar in the composite substrates. The exact fracture path observed was a function of (i) the type of composite substrate, (ii) the type of adhesive, and (iii) the mode of loading employed. However, the nature of the fracture path was found to be quite insensitive to the test rate. Essentially, it was found that joints subjected to mixed-mode I/II loading were more likely to exhibit an interlaminar fracture path in the composite substrates than when loaded in either pure modes I or II. The propensity for a given joint to exhibit such a fracture path via delamination of the composite substrate has been explained by calculating the transverse tensile stresses induced in the loaded composite arms, and comparing this value to the measured transverse tensile strength of the composite. Following this approach, the underlying reasons for the observed fracture path were identified and could be predicted. Also, the proposed scheme provides a route to design against delamination failure occurring in adhesively-bonded fibre-composite test specimens. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the present study, mode I and II interlaminar fracture toughness and delamination fatigue crack growth behavior were investigated with unidirectional ALF/epoxy laminates using double cantilever beam specimens and end notched flexure specimens both with a special loading device. The fracture toughness values and the fatigue crack growth resistance of ALF/epoxy laminates were higher than those of CF/epoxy laminates with similar matrices. The analysis of the stress-ratio dependency showed that the contribution of the maximum stress was higher for ALF/epoxy than that for CF/epoxy laminates. The fractographic observation indicated that the interfacial fracture was dominant on the fracture surfaces of fatigue fracture, suggesting that the microscopic mechanism was different from that of CF/epoxy laminates.",

Interlaminar shear stress was evaluated to assess the delamination tolerance on both virgin (preexposed) and harsh environment-exposed composites specimens. Delamination tests were performed with the pattern of four-point bending and tensile and compression shear tests under different combinations of humidity and temperature exposure, ranging from zero to 32 weeks. During the tests, the stress at the onset of delamination was taken as the first deviation of the load-displacement curve. Experimental study revealed that the delamination load-carrying capability reduced to 40% with the exposure time. Throughout the aging process dimensional stability was almost unchanged; however, 1.29% moisture absorption was noticeable in laminated composites. Microstructures of the delaminated surface revealed that failure occurs suddenly in a macroscopically fragile mode by crack initiation and proliferation. The delamination mechanism involved interlaminar processing flaws that favored the initiation and propagation of the interlaminar cracks, which are responsible for the delamination of the composite. As load carrying capacity dwindles substantially, therefore the effect of temperature and moisture must be taken into account in the experimental characterization of the laminates when establishing a design limit for composite structure.",

Here, low velocity impact tests are undertaken using an instrumented impact tower and high velocity impact tests are conducted using a nitrogen gas gun. Low velocity impact testing has shown that the specific perforation energy of the CF/PEEK-based FMLs is similar to that offered by the CF/PEEK composite. In contrast, the specific perforation energy of the GF/PEI FML system is lower than that of the plain PEI composite. The experimental evidence suggests that the inclusion of strong titanium alloy plies does not improve the perforation resistance of these FMLs. High velocity impact tests resulted in failure processes similar to those observed under low velocity loading conditions, with the specific perforation energy of the GF/PEI-based FMLs being higher than those exhibited by the plain GF/PEI composite. An extensive and detailed optical microscope study has shown that interfacial and interlaminar delaminations are the principal energy-absorbing mechanisms during low and high velocity impacts.",

Several angles between 15?? and 45?? are investigated in a [????5]s layup. It is shown that for all angles delaminations are suppressed, allowing considerable pseudo-ductile strains to develop.

The first one tackles the delamination detection within damaged thin laminated structures. In the finite element method (FEM) computational code, those laminated structures have been modelled using multi-layered shell elements. The methodology uses post-process criteria, based on fracture mechanics linked with damage mechanics, of computational code by the effective stress tensor. ??? In the second place, the influence of delamination over the overall behaviour of the structure is taken into account. This influence is introduced by locally changing material characterization, quite progressively during the loading phase. These integrated effects change the numerical behaviour on loading and energy curves. The validation is carried out with experimental low velocity impact tests on the bending tests. A satisfactory coherence is shown for damage mechanisms and delamination shapes, in different examples. The methodology developed is recognized a predictive process for several laminates under study. It can be used as a potential tool to size laminated structures at design stage. We will present the different aspects of this delamination approach. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The assumption of lamina homogeneity is questionable when predicting failure, though it is suitable for stress analysis. Matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination are inherent to the inhomogeneous nature of the composite, thus the assumption of material homogeneity taints the failure prediction. It is, therefore, essential that the inhomogeneous nature of the composites must be retained in the analysis in order to predict the correct failure modes. Hence, this study considers distinct properties of the fiber and matrix and their volume fractions and fiber orientations while modeling composite laminates. The peridynamic theory is employed to predict the damage in center-cracked laminates with different fiber orientations. The predictions from the peridynamic analysis agree with the experimental observations published in the literature. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The effect of strain rate on the compressive and shear behavior of carbon/epoxy composite materials was investigated. Strain rate behavior of composites with fiber waviness was also studied. Falling weight impact system and servohydraulic testing machine were used for dynamic characterisation of composite materials in compression at strain rates up to several hundred per second. Strain rates below 10s−1 were generated using a hydraulic testing machine. Strain rates above 10s−1 were generated using the drop tower apparatus developed. Seventy-two-ply unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminates (IM6G/3501-6) loaded in the longitudinal and transverse directions and [(08/908)2/0̄8]s crossply laminates were characterised. Off-axis (30 and 45°) compression tests of the same unidirectional material were also conducted to obtain the in-plane shear stress–strain behavior. The 90° properties, which are governed by the matrix, show an increase in modulus and strength over the static values but no significant change in ultimate strain. The shear stress–strain behavior, which is also matrix-dominated, shows high nonlinearity with a plateau region at a stress level that increases significantly with increasing strain rate. The 0° and crossply laminates show higher strength and strain values as the strain rate increases, whereas the modulus increases only slightly over the static value. The increase in strength and ultimate strain observed may be related to the shear behavior of the composite and the change in failure modes. In all cases the dynamic stress–strain curves stiffen as the strain rate increases. The stiffening is lowest in the longitudinal case and highest in the transverse and shear cases. Unidirectional and crossply specimens with fiber waviness were fabricated and tested. It is shown that, with severe fiber waviness, strong nonlinearity occurs in the stress–strain curves due to fiber waviness with significant stiffening as the strain rate increases.",

This complements the work done by numerous other researchers who have also examined low velocity impact of composites, but have focused on unidirectional, cross-ply or quasi-isotropic laminates. In the present study, post-impact static uniaxial tension, compression, as well as tension-compression fatigue tests are performed. The damage mechanisms for woven laminates are found to be predominantly delamination and fiber breakage, with the area of impact-induced delamination increasing linearly with impact energy for the range of energies examined. Damage extent and type are also dependent on the curvature of the impactor tip and deformation generated by a sharp impactor is more localized. The existence of a threshold energy level below which no delamination discernible by C-scan occurs is noted. In contrast with previous findings, it is observed that the peak in the impactor deceleration-time response is not associated with the onset of fiber failure, which can occur earlier. The amount of energy absorbed when this peak occurs therefore does not indicate the energy required to initiate fiber breakage. It is observed that residual tensile strength is a function of delamination area and impactor tip radius. For static compression and tension-compression fatigue, the residual load-bearing capacity is only dependent on delamination area. Under compression, delamination promotes the micro-buckling of fibers, whereas in tension, failure is predominantly via fiber breakage. For a common impact energy and impactor, a damaged specimen is weaker in compression than in tension.",

The delamination is a major problem associated with the drilling fiber reinforced composite materials, which reduce the structural integrity of the material. The present work focuses on the analysis of delamination behavior as a function of drilling process parameters at the entrance of the CFRP plates. The delamination analysis in high speed drilling is performed by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model with spindle speed, feed rate and point angle as the affecting parameters. A multilayer feed forward ANN architecture, trained using error-back propagation training algorithm (EBPTA) is employed for this purpose. Drilling experiments are conducted as per full factorial design using cemented carbide (grade K20) twist drills that serve as input-output patterns for ANN training. The ANN model so developed is validated by presenting training and new testing input patterns. The validated ANN model is then used to generate the direct and interaction effect plots to analyze the delamination behavior. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the ANN models to analyze the effects of drilling process parameters on delamination factor. The analysis also demonstrates the advantage of employing higher speed in controlling the delamination during drilling.",

Two sets of full three-dimensional analyses have been performed (one with the thermal residual stresses developed while curing the laminate and the other without thermal residual stresses i.e., with mechanical loading only) to calculate the displacements and interlaminar stresses along the annular shaped delaminated interface responsible for delamination onset and propagation. Modified Crack Closure Integral (MCCI) method based on the concept of linear elastic fracture mechanics has been followed to calculate the three modes of Strain Energy Release Rates (SERR). The strain energy release rate components GI, GII and GIII along the annular shaped delamination front due to thermal residual stresses developed while curing the laminate (i.e., cooling from an elevated temperature of thermosetting to the room temperature) and the subsequent mechanical loading have been obtained by superimposing their respective effects. Numerical calculations are carried out for multi-layered cross-ply and angle-ply glass/epoxy FRP composite laminates and the strain energy release rate plots demonstrate large asymmetries along the delamination front due to the interaction of residual curing stresses and superimposed mechanical loading. It is observed that the residual curing stresses have the effect of enhancing the behaviour of delamination growth. On subsequent mechanical loading this can be a potential source of causing premature failure due to the superimposed thermomechanical effects. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

One MFC and one FBG were bonded on each surface of the CFRP laminate to generate and receive the symmetric modes and the anti-symmetric modes separately for identification of the multiple modes of Lamb waves in the laminate. Then we investigated the mode conversion of Lamb waves at both tips of a delamination in the middle of the thickness of the lamimate, through an experiment and finite element analysis (FEA). On the basis of the knowledge about the mode conversion, an index to evaluate the delamination length was proposed using velocity changes by the mode conversions.

Fatigue crack growth tests were carried out with end-notched-flexure specimens at the stress-ratios of R = 0.3, 0.1, -0.5, and -1. In UD laminates, the threshold of energy release rate range, ??GII th, of fatigue crack growth was independent of the stress-ratio. In C laminates, the ??GII th value at negative stress-ratios was about four times of that at positive stress-ratios. In C laminates, a fatigue crack propagated along the interface of the unidirectional tape at positive stress-ratios, while along the interface of the satin-woven fabric at negative stress-ratios. When the stress-ratio was negative, the fracture surface of C laminates was rough because of the resin rich area of fabric intersection, and this roughness gave rise to the constraint of the plastic deformation near the crack tip. Thus the crack growth resistance of C laminates at negative stress-ratios was much higher than that at positive stress-ratios. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The energy method is derived from the general concepts of classical fracture mechanics. When used judiciously and with proper interpretation of the physical factors pertinent to the crack growth process at the lamina( ply) level, the method describes well delamination growth behavior in laminates that are subjected to monotonically (static) or cyclically( fatigue) applied loads or to both. Both could be in tension or in compression. The basic method can be used to describe not only one-dimensional delamination growth (for example. free edge delamination) but also two-dimensional delamination growth (contoured delamination). Laboratory test results using laminates made of an AS-3501-06 graphite epoxy system are presented along with analytically predicted results . Excellent correlations between analytical and experimental results are obtained.",

Impact-induced delamination and matrix cracks were found to be the most detrimental damage modes in laminated composites. The numerical model developed is based on an interface finite element compatible with three-dimensional solid elements, which allows to model delamination between layers and matrix cracking inside layers. The damage model is based on the indirect use of fracture mechanics considering a softening stress-relative displacements equation and permits to simulate the initiation and propagation of damage avoiding the definition of initial flaws.

The effects of different types (fibres or particles) and concentrations of the mendable EMAA agent on the self-healing efficiency was measured using mode I interlaminar fracture toughness testing and fractographic analysis. The EMAA was effective in healing delamination damage and increasing the fracture toughness compared to the original laminate. High healing efficiency was achieved by the wide area flow of EMAA (increase of ∼25 times) through delamination cracks under the pressure delivery mechanism. High recovery in the fracture toughness was achieved after healing by the formation of large-scale EMAA-bridging ligaments along the delamination, which is a toughening mechanism unique to this type of self-healing material. EMAA proved effective for the multiple repairs of delamination cracks with some loss in the self-healing efficiency of the mendable laminates. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The total impact energy is classified into four categories including delamination energy, membrane energy, bending energy and rebounding energy, and the contributions of each energy absorption mechanism have been evaluated. The membrane and bending energy were calculated from image analysis of the deformed shape of the impacted specimen while the delamination energy was calculated by using the deplying technique. The multiaxial warp-knit composite showed higher impact fracture toughness and bending properties and this resulted in a bending energy increase and reduced delamination while the membrane and delamination energy were the dominant energy-absorption modes for the woven composite laminate. The delaminated areas in the woven laminates were much larger than those in the multiaxial warp-knit composites, while the delamination energy absorption was slightly higher since the impact fracture toughness of the woven laminate was much smaller than those of the multiaxial warp-knit composites.

Nine 3-m RC concrete beams, one unstrengthened, four strengthened with S-type CFRP laminates, and four strengthened with R-type laminates, were loaded under four different loading schedules. The stroke rates ranged from 0.0167 mm/s (slow rate of loading) to 36 mm/s (fast rate of loading). This induced a strain rate in the CFRP of 2.96 με/s (slow rate) to 6,930 με/s (fast rate). Some beams were subjected to either 1 or 12 cycles of loading prior to a fast rate of loading to failure. The rapidly loaded beams showed an increase of approximately 5% in capacity, stiffness, and energy absorption. Ductility and the mode of failure were not directly affected by the change in loading rate. Precycled beams performed similarly to the beams loaded monotonically to failure but showed a 10% increase in service stiffness and a 10% loss in energy absorption. A finite-element, layered analysis is presented to predict the moment-curvature response of CFRP strengthened RC beams.

Unlike metals, the energy plot of a DCB specimen shows increase in energy release rate with increase in crack length. Also during testing the steady state energy release rate from each of the samples of the same batch shows a lot of variation due to fiber cross-over bridging that occurs only in unidirectional composites.

Then using the probabilistic CZM, the energy release rate variations of 76.2. mm crack size DCB model are predicted and compared to the test results.

          "abstract": "Fiber reinforced composites have been widely used in aerospace applications due to their functional properties, such as high strength-to-weight ratios. But many challenges remain to be overcome in order to permit more confidence in the performance of composite structures. In particular, composites have different failure types and modes that make damage prediction and propagation a very challenging subject. The main two damage types are matrix micro-cracking and delamination. Matrix micro-cracking develops first, causing delamination. The detection and quantification of matrix micro-cracks would provide the needed information to predict the development of delamination and the correct safety or maintenance decision to be made. The challenge in matrix micro-cracking identification is that it is a distributed damage, while delamination is a localized damage. The state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques are good at detecting and localizing major changes in sensor signals, which usually points to delamination, holes or other localized defects. Furthermore, there are a limited number of features that can be extracted from sensor signals, and most of them are affected by both delamination and matrix micro-cracking. The work presented in this paper aims at finding which features are more sensitive to each damage type (delamination or matrix micro-cracks), and applying machine learning techniques to learn and model a classifier that uses these features efficiently to classify the detected damage.",

In terms of energythe TTR fiber pull-out can be accompanied bysignificant amount of energydissipation due to the frictional work at interface; this process absorbs part of the energythat would otherwise be placed at the delamination front of the structure. The basic objective of this research project was to develop an efficient and accurate finite-element-based numerical tool to simulate the spontaneous propagation of a single TTR pull-out under quasi-static conditions and in the presence of frictional contact between the fiber/ matrix interface. The pull-out phenomenon was studied assuming a constant friction coefficient at the interface along the TTR axial direction and using improved contact-elements to solve the frictional contact problem. Load/displacement bridging curves of the fiber pull-out process, which includes elastic deformation with a fully/partially bonded interface plus frictional sliding, were calculated. Moreover, the effect of friction model was also investigated. Numerical results were validated byexperimental observations of debonding and frictional sliding of a fiber in steady-state pull-out tests under pure Mode I loading conditions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "In this article, interlaminar crack initiation and propagation under mode I and II dynamic loading of an epoxy matrix reinforced with unidirectional carbon fibers were evaluated. Delamination in mode I was carried out employing the DCB test (Double Cantilever Beam). In mode II, the ENF test (End Notched Flexure) was used. The fracture toughness in mode I was obtained using the methods of the ASTM D5528 Standard, whereas in mode II, the methods were applied in accordance with the ESIS (European Structural Integrity Society) Protocol. Employing this experimental program, the fatigue curves (ΔG,N) and growth rate curves (ΔG, da/dN) in both fracture modes were determined for an asymmetry ratio R = 0.2. The influence of the manufacturing process of the material on its behavior with respect to crack growth onset may be deduced from the experimental results, mainly the presence of resin bags. Moreover, as the crack growth rate decreases for large crack lengths, crack growth may even cease if the critical fracture energy does not increase above the values obtained in the static characterization of the material.

The strength behavior of FRP and FML under in-plane load and out-of-plane load is compared based on the optimization results. Results show that for in-plane load, due to the substituting of metal alloy sheet for prepreg layer, the strength behavior in transverse direction is enhanced and FML has better resistance to biaxial load. For out-of-plane point load, FML offers strength performance superior to that of FRP and is more stable for all the boundary conditions investigated.",

This paper reviews the current damage mechanics and fracture methods for predicting delamination under impact available in the literature. Many damage mechanics models are available, some providing good delamination predictions. The linear elastic fracture mechanics method has been used extensively where the shape of the delamination front can be predicted and a suitably shaped mesh can be provided. However, as impact events produce irregular shaped delamination fronts, this method requires an adaptive mesh approach that is not yet available in any of the major analysis codes. The cohesive fracture model solves some of the limitation of the linear elastic fracture mechanics method, however a definitive study of its abilities has yet to be found in the literature. The delamination threshold load method is an extremely simple method and provides surprisingly good results. The review concludes that additional development of current techniques is required before a definitive predictive delamination method will be available. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

These properties make CFRP suitable for use in structural components for aerospace applications. Drilling is the most common machining process applied to CFRP laminates, and it is difficult due to the extremely abrasive nature of the carbon fibers and low thermal conductivity of CFRP. It is a challenge for manufacturers to drill CFRP materials without causing any delamination on the work part while also considering the economics of the process. The subject of this study is the drilling of fabric woven type CFRP laminates which are known to be more resistant to delamination than unidirectional type CFRP laminates. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of double point angle drill geometry on drilling performance through an experimental approach. An uncoated carbide and two diamond coated carbide drills with different drill tip angles are employed in drilling experiments of aerospace quality thick fabric woven CFRP laminates. Force and torque measurements are used to investigate appropriate drilling conditions based on drill geometry and ideal drilling parameters are determined. Tool life tests of the drills were conducted and the condition of the diamond coating is examined as a function of drilling operational parameters. High feed rate drilling experiments are observed to be favorable in terms of drill wear. Feed is observed to be more important than speed, and the upper limit of feed is dictated by the drill design and the rigidity of the machine drill. Hole diameter variation due to drill wear is monitored to determine drill life. At high feeds, hole diameter tolerance is observed to be more critical than hole exit delamination during drilling of fabric woven CFRP laminates. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Damage modes and the damage process of laminates under varied impact energies are discussed. Two different stacking sequences, [0/90/0/90]s and [0/90/+45/−45]s, were chosen in tests for comparison. An alternative method, based on variation of the excessive energy (Ee) versus impact energy (Ei), is presented to determine penetration threshold (Pn). The penetration threshold for stacking sequence [0/90/+45/−45]s is found to be smaller than that of [0/90/0/90]s. The primary damage mode was found to be fiber fracture for higher impact energies; whereas, it was indentation resulting in delamination and matrix cracks for smaller impact energies. Contour plots of the overall damage areas are also depicted for several impact energies.",

A numerical analysis strategy based on material property degradation method (MPDM) and cohesive elements (CE) is developed to model progressive failure of scaled double-notched composite laminates, where the material property degradation method is used to model the intralaminar failure and the cohesive elements are employed to account for the delamination at the interfaces. Different failure theories are considered in the material property degradation method-cohesive element approach and a comparative study of these failure theories is presented. The mesh dependency of the material property degradation method-cohesive element approach is investigated with different notch and element types for the double-notched composite laminates. Size scaling effects are also studied by traditional fracture models and the material property degradation method-cohesive element approach, significantly revealing a trend in strength reduction of notched composites with increasing specimen size. The predictions are compared with the experimental results and reasonably good agreement is observed.",

The effects of transverse shear, elastic couplings and restrained warping are also included while modeling the thin walled composite beams. Matrix cracking is modeled at the laminate level and debonding/delamination and fiber breakage at the lamina level and included in the formulation by adjusting the A, B and D matrices for composite laminates. The beam analysis is used to investigate the effect of damage on the various properties of thin walled composite beams such as out-of-plane stiffness, in-plane stiffness and torsion stiffness and deflections such as bending slopes and twist under an applied load. A two-cell airfoil section with [0/??45/90]s family of laminates having stiffness properties equivalent to a stiff in-plane hingeless rotor blade is considered. It is found that the bending and torsion stiffness loss due to matrix cracking is about 6-12% and 25-30%, respectively, and due to debonding/delamination is further 6-8% and 40-45%, respectively. Most of the bending stiffness loss is observed in the fiber breakage damage mode. It is also observed that the combination of the static tip bending and torsion response can be used to predict length of the damaged part of the thin walled composite beams, damage location and damage level. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This mixed-mode bending (MMB) test was analyzed using both finite-element procedures and beam theory to calculate the mode I and mode II components of strain-energy release rate GI and GII, respectively. A wide range of GI/GII ratios can be produced by varying the load position on the lever. As the delamination extended, the GI/GII ratios varied by less than 5%. Beam theory equations agreed closely with the finite-element results and provide a basis for selection of GI/GII test ratios and a basis for computing the mode I and mode II components of measured delamination toughness. The MMB test was demonstrated using AS4/PEEK(APC2) unidirectional laminates. The MMB test introduced in this paper is rather simple and is believed to offer several advantages over most current mixed-mode test.",

Different types of multiple delaminations are considered and their effects upon buckling behavior are examined. The nonlinear buckling analysis uses a finite element method, including contact elements to prevent the overlapping situation, to predict the buckling stress and the corresponding buckling mode. The results indicate that as the length of the beneath delaminations is not larger than the length of the near-surface delamination, the beneath delaminations have no significant effects on the buckling stress, such that the buckling behaviors of multiple delaminations are almost the same as those of single delamination. When a short delamination appears above the long delamination, three types of multiple delaminations are investigated. If the length of the short delamination is greater than one critical value, the short delamination above the long delamination will reduce the buckling stress and change the buckling mode. When the short delamination approaches the same length as the long delamination, the buckling stress becomes the value of the single delamination case. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The contact phenomenon is different in small and large indentation stages. which is due to occurrence of laminate damage. The contact force corresponding to the onset of laminate damage is found to be independent of the indentor size. In the small indentation stage where the plate is intact. the change of laminate stacking sequence has an insignificant effect on the force-indentation relationship. However. the force-indentor size relationship does not follow the modified contact law for thin laminates indented by large indentors. Beyond the small indentation stage, damage occurs. The size of the delamination area is proportional to the applied loads and the number of repeated loading cycles. The passage of the delamination crack front can be detected using strain gauges. Also. the indentation spring becomes stiffer under repeated loading. Finally, the delamination damage and the strain history in a laminate at lowvelocity impact are found to be very similar to those in the contact test except that vibration was observed in the impact test.",

By means of finite element approach, the laminae stiffnesses are constructed independently from their interface, where a well-defined virtually zero-thickness interface element is discreetly adopted for delamination simulation. The present model has the advantage of simulating a localized interfacial condition at arbitrary locations, for various degeneration areas and intensities, under the influence of numerous boundary conditions since the interfacial description is expressed discretely. In comparison, the model shows good agreement with existing results from the literature when modeled in a perfectly bonded state. It is found that as the local delamination area increases, so does the magnitude of the maximum displacement history. Also, as top and bottom fiber orientations deviation increases, both central deflection and energy absorption increase although the relative maximum displacement correspondingly decreases when in contrast to the laminates perfectly bonded state.",

          "abstract": "The tensile strength of the 0??plies within different cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates of varying size and stacking sequence has been investigated. For those lay-ups having failure confined to the gauge section, no size effect was observed in the strength of 0??plies. In laminates exhibiting a size versus strength relationship, failures were found to occur in the gauge section for the smallest laminates, but at the grip for the larger laminates. The occurrence of failure at the grips is not obvious for these lay-ups. A major purpose of this paper is to identify the failure initiation point, and the sequence of events that leads to complete fracture of 0??plies in unidirectional laminates, and the quasi-isotropic and cross-ply lay-ups. A statistically significant set of 3-point bend tests of unidirectional beams was conducted to obtain valid parameters (Weibull modulus and strength) for a Weibull-statistics-based strength model which would be used to predict the ultimate strength of 0??plies within different cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates. No significant difference between the maximum stress in bending or strength of the valid tensile tests was found. In contrast Weibull theory predicted unidirectional strength loss of over 30% for the range of volumes tested. Although the dramatic strength scaling observed here has been shown to arise from the test method, the authors are not ready to rule out scaling effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Investigation covers four prepreg tapes and two fabrics, and the use of woven laminates over directional tape is motivated.

          "abstract": "During the past decades, increasing demand in aircraft industry for high-performance, lightweight structures have stimulated a strong trend towards the development of refined models for fibre-metal laminates (FMLs). Fibre metal laminates are hybrid composite materials built up from interlacing layers of thin metals and fibre reinforced adhesives. The most commercially available fibre metal laminates (FMLs) are ARALL (Aramid Reinforced Aluminium Laminate), based on aramid fibres, GLARE (Glass Reinforced Aluminium Laminate), based on high strength glass fibres and CARALL (Carbon Reinforced Aluminium Laminate), based on carbon fibres. Taking advantage of the hybrid nature from their two key constituents: metals (mostly aluminium) and fibre-reinforced laminate, these composites offer several advantages such as better damage tolerance to fatigue crack growth and impact damage especially for aircraft applications. Metallic layers and fibre reinforced laminate can be bonded by classical techniques, i.e. mechanically and adhesively. Adhesively bonded fibre metal laminates have been shown to be far more fatigue resistant than equivalent mechanically bonded structures. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Owing to its complex nature, only very limited information on this subject is currently available. The composite delamination problem involves not only geometric and material discontinuities but also inherently coupled mode I, II, and III fracture in the layered anisotropic system. Based on the recently developed anisotropic laminate elasticity theory and an eigenfunction expansion method, the exact crack-tip stress singularity and complete field solutions for the composite edge delamination problem are obtained. Fracture mechanics parameters such as mixed-mode stress intensity factors and associated strain energy release rates for a delamination are defined explicitly. For illustrative purposes, results are given for edge-delaminated symmetric [0-/-0/ — 0/0] graphite-epoxy composites subjected to uniform axial extension. Effects of geometric, lamination, and crack variables are examined.",

It is shown that the toughness is improved owing to the presence of these nano-particles although nano-rubber is more effective than nano-silica. Further, by keeping the total particle weight percentage constant in epoxies (e.g., at 8 and 12 wt.%) filled with equal amount of nano-silica and nano-rubber, the interlaminar toughness values of the hybrid laminates are always higher than those with nano-silica filled epoxies but lower than those with nano-rubber filled matrices. Scanning electron microscopy examination of the delaminated surfaces of composite laminates filled with nano-particles revealed that cavitation of nano-rubber particles/void growth and debonding of nano-silica from epoxy matrix are responsible for the improved interlaminar toughness observed. It is also shown that the bulk toughness of nano-particle filled epoxies cannot be fully transferred to the interlaminar toughness of composite laminates, being limited by the constraint effect imposed by the carbon fibres. Finally, the role of fibre-bridging on the delaminated crack and hence delamination toughness is discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Delamination tests have been performed on (35/-35/90) and (90/45/-45) laminate families consisting of 24 plies with different stacking sequences in order to examine the stacking method. The (35/-35/90) laminate family were tested under static tension and the (90/45/-45) family under static compression to eliminate the effect of transverse cracking on free-edge delamination.

Thrust generated during the drilling operation is identified as responsible for delamination. Expressions developed for critical thrusts and critical feed rates, by modeling the delamination zone as an elliptical plate in unidirectional laminates, appear to be fairly accurate. It has been demonstrated that the critical thrusts and feed rates obtained for unidirectional laminates can be conservatively used for multi-directional laminates. With regard to the tool geometry, the chisel edge width appears to be the single most important factor contributing to the thrust force and hence delamination. A hollow grinding drill tool was designed and tested. This tool resulted in a much smaller thrust and much better hole quality as compared with the standard twist drills.",

Energy loss analysis was also performed which showed that Panel C had the best energy dissipation property. Macroscopic postmortem analysis and DIC results showed that Panel C can mitigate higher intensity blast waves without initiation of catastrophic damage in the panel.

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0°/90°] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies. Predictions of residual velocity, development of deformation and delamination correlate well with experimental results.",

However, many practical problems of embedded delamination in composite laminates are inherently three-dimensional in nature. Although in such cases, the finite element (FE) method can be employed, there are some issues that must be examined more closely to ensure physically realistic models. One of these issues is the effect of mesh design on the determination of the local SERR along the delamination front. There are few studies that deal with this aspect systematically. In this paper, the effect of mesh design in the calculation of SERR in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) FE analyses of the post-buckling behavior of embedded delaminations is studied and some guidelines on mesh design are suggested. Two methods of calculation of the SERR are considered: The virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) and crack closure technique (CCT). The 2D analyses confirm that if the near-tip mesh is symmetric and consists of square elements, then the evaluation of the SERR is not sensitive to mesh refinement, and a reasonably coarse mesh is adequate. Despite agreement in the global post-buckling response of the delaminated part, the SERR calculated using different unsymmetrical near-tip meshes could be different. Therefore, unsymmetrical near-tip meshes should be avoided, as convergence of the SERR with mesh refinement could not be assured. While the results using VCCT and CCT for 2D analyses agree well with each other, these techniques yield different quantitative results when applied to 3D analyses. The reason may be due to the way in which the delamination growth is modeled. The CCT allows simultaneous delamination advance over finite circumferential lengths, but it is very difficult to implement and the results exhibit mesh dependency. Qualitatively, however, the two sets of results show similar distributions of Mode I and Mode II components of the SERR. This is fortunate, since the VCCT is relatively easy to implement.

Composites were prepared by integrating partially cured thin films at the laminate mid-plane using vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. The introduction of epoxy/PA interlayers increased fracture toughness due to the ductile deformation and crack bridging of PA particles within an interlaminar damage zone with uniform thickness of about 20 ??m. Composites interlayered with epoxy/PA/MWCNT exhibited nearly 2.5 and 1.5 times higher fracture toughness than composites containing neat epoxy and epoxy/PA interlayers, respectively, without an observable increase in interlaminar thickness. The fracture surface was analyzed to identify failure modes responsible for the fracture toughness improvement. The MWCNTs are proposed to inhibit critical loading of defects by minimizing stress concentration within the interlaminar region, thereby enabling greater deformation of the PA particles during fracture. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The single beam was used to investigate the effect of three different resin systems on the strain energy release rate, one of which, polyetheretherketone (peek) gave a value approximately ten times that of the other two.

Uniaxial tension behaviors of KBFBs and KBFB-reinforced epoxy strands were evaluated statistically using large sample sets. The elastic modulus, tensile strength, as well as failure strains of KBFBs, displayed large scatter statistically ranging from 10% to 30%. The loading rate-dependency was evaluated at three strain rates ranging from approximately 10-4 ??? 10-2/s. The tensile strength increases gradually as the loading rate increases, while the tensile modulus almost remains the same as the loading rate increases until the loading rate reaches 10-2/s, at which a much higher modulus was presented. The high temperatures (170-180 ??C), possibly subjected during fiber processing and composite fabrication, do not impose significant effects on the tensile properties of KBFBs if the duration is less than 1-h. The tensile properties of KBFB were not affected by the conditioning at 130 ??C for 24-h, which mimics the severe service temperature of automotive front-end components. KBFB-epoxy composite strands were further evaluated at various loading rates. A micromechanics-based Mori-Tanaka model was implemented to predict the anisotropic elastic moduli of KBFB and KBFB-epoxy composite strands based on the microstructural compositions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Migration occurs in two main stages: (1) the initial 0/?? interface delamination turns, transforming into intraply cracks that grow through the ?? plies; this process occurs at multiple locations across the width of a specimen, (2) one or more of these cracks growing through the ?? plies reaches and turns into the ??/0 ply interface, where it continues to grow as a delamination.

In the initial part of this experimental program, the tensile and flexural properties of these hybrid materials were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. Here, no significant scaling effects were observed in the mechanical response of the laminates. Following this, simply-supported scaled beams and plates were subjected to low-velocity impact loading in order to investigate scaling effects in the processes of damage development and target perforation. Here, response parameters such as the target deflection, the impact force, and the damage threshold energy were found to obey the scaling law.

          "abstract": "Delamination is a frequent and potentially serious damage that can occur in laminated polymer composites due to the poor inter-laminar fracture toughness of the matrix. Vibration based detection methods employ changes caused by loss of stiffness in dynamic parameters such as frequencies to detect and assess damage. One of the challenges of using frequency shift for damage detection is that while the presence of damage is easily identified through a shift in measured frequency, the determination of the location and the severity of the damage are not easy to accomplish. To determine the location and severity of damage from measured changes in frequency, it is necessary to solve the inverse problem, which requires the solution of a set of non-linear simultaneous equations. In this paper, we examine three different inverse algorithms for solving the non-linear equations to predict the interface, lengthwise location and size of delamination: direct of solution using a graphical method, artificial neural network (ANN) and surrogate-based optimization. The three inverse algorithms have been validated using numerical data generated from the finite element model (FEM) of delaminated beams and measured frequencies from modal testing conducted on simply supported and cantilever carbon fiber reinforced beam specimens. Results show that all three algorithms can predict the delamination parameters accurately using the validation data directly generated from FE model. However, if using experimental data from real beams, ANN does not fare as well as the other two methods as it is more sensitive to the measurement errors. Finally, the advantages and limitations of each method have been summarized to provide a useful guide for selecting inverse algorithms for vibration-based delamination detection. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Usually polymer matrix laminates are made of individual plies with unidirectional fiber reinforcement laid upon each other with varying fiber orientations with respect to the thickness coordinate. Due to missing fiber reinforcement in the thickness direction, this results in poor through-thickness (out-of-plane) properties of composite laminates. One method to enhance the out-of-plane properties is the stitching of dry semi-finished fiber products in the thickness direction prior to the infusion of the resin. On the other hand, the insertion of stitching yarns in the thickness direction may affect the mechanical properties in the laminate plane such as stiffness and strength. To quantify the effect of structural through-thickness reinforcement in non-crimp fabric carbon fiber/epoxy laminates under uniaxial tension and compression loading an experimental study was carried out which included a systematic variation of the yarn diameter, the stitching pattern and direction as well as the load direction. The results showed a significant effect of the stitching on the in-plane Young&#039;s modulus which was attributed to local displacements of the in-plane fibers and changes in the fiber volume fraction. A finite element based unit-cell model was developed to estimate the elastic constants of structurally stitched non-crimp fabric laminates taking into consideration the yarn diameter, the stitching pattern and direction as well as the load direction. Depending on these parameters, local changes of the fiber volume fraction as well as regions with undisturbed and disturbed fiber orientations within the laminate plies are taken into account. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this objective, an instrumented loading set-up has been designed to fit inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). With this technique, the SEM images of loaded specimens are analyzed to obtain the crack opening displacements (COD) as a function of distance from the crack tip. For mode I tests conducted on AS4/3501-6 unidirectional material, good agreement is obtained between the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) calculations and the measurements, in terms of both general shape and magnitude. The results show that the COD increases linearly with the applied displacement up to failure. Thus, for the case of a brittle material under mode I loading, there is good agreement between the measured and calculated crack tip displacements, and the material behaves in a linear elastic way up to failure. By extending the technique to mode II and mixed-mode loading and by testing other tougher materials in the future, we hope to increase our understanding of mixed-mode failure criteria, which play an important role in the detailed analysis of complex composite structures under realistic loading",

The approach uses experiments to detect the failure mechanisms, two and three-dimensional stress analysis to determine the location of first matrix cracking and computational fracture mechanics to investigate the potential for cracks and delamination growth. The laminates strength and damage mechanisms obtained from both experimental and finite elements analysis are presented for several laminates lay-up configurations. Observations on the performed experiments show matrix crack initiation and propagation in the skin and near the flange tip, causing the flange to almost fully debounded from the skin in some cases, interlaminar debounding and fiber breakage up to the failure of the components. The finite elements analysis is also show that the matrix cracks are initiated in the first skin layer for most of the cases. With increasing the applied load the matrix cracks are propagated through the thickness to reach the next layer and causes delamination between the two layers. With increasing the applied load this delamination is propagated up to the occurrence of unstable delamination growth or the first fiber breakage known as the final failure of the component. The obtained experimental failure loads are compared with those calculated by the finite elements analysis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

These fibers bridging the crack could reduce the effective stress intensity factor actually experienced by the crack tip. Based on the measurement of crack length and delamination size, the effective stress intensity range, ??Keff, of fatigue-damaged CARALL laminate was calculated by using a simplified analytical model. It was shown that the fatigue crack propagation rate in CARALL could be expressed as a unique function of the calculated ??Keff, which agree well with the Paris equation for the unreinforced aluminum alloy. This result confirmed the applicability of this simplified analytical model in CARALL laminates. ?? 1995.",

This is critical for the safe design of composite cryogenic fuel tanks. The methodology, which is based on an extended finite element method for simulation of crack growth, does not require a priori definition of initial crack (delamination) length or crack propagation path. In contrast, previous work required estimation of delamination length and corresponding number of thermal cycles based on experimental measurements. The methodology is validated against measurements from standardised static and fatigue delamination test methods. Prediction of delamination crack growth in a quasi-isotropic laminate under cryogenic fatigue loading is used to establish the effect of initial interlaminar defect length on subsequent crack growth, as well as the effect of delamination length on DCOD and permeability. A key additional benefit is that the proposed method can simulate both inter- and intralaminar crack growth in two- and three-dimensional geometries. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

X-ray radiography is used to observe in-plane matrix cracks and overall delamination propagation; whilst ??CT is exploited to examine cross-sectional views showing detailed through-thickness matrix cracks distribution and 3D delamination damage pattern. It is revealed that stitches act as crack initiation sites, due to the presence of weak resin-rich pockets around stitch threads, thus inevitably resulting in densely stitched composites having more stitch-induced matrix cracks upon impact loading. It is also concluded that specimens with higher stitch density and thread thickness are more capable of impeding delamination growth by effectively bridging delamination cracks and arresting crack propagation. ??CT evidently shows that 3D delamination pattern in densely stitched composite is more cylindrical in shape, whereas that of a moderately stitched or unstitched composite is more conical. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In many practical situations, the structures are subjected to loading at very high strain rates. Material and structural response vary significantly under such loading as compared to static loading. A structure that is expected to perform under dynamic loading conditions, if designed with the static properties, might be too conservative. Hence. it is necessary to characterize the advanced composites under high strain rate loading. In the current investigations, the response of carbon/epoxy laminated composites under high strain rate compression loading is considered using a modified split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) setup at three different strain rates of 82, 164 and 817 s-1. The laminates were fabricated using 32 plies of a DA 4518 unidirectional carbon/epoxy prepreg system. Both unidirectional and cross-ply laminates were considered for the study. In the case of cross-ply laminates, the samples were tested in the thickness as well as in the in-plane direction. The unidirectional laminate samples were subjected to loading along 0° and 90° directions. Dynamic stress-strain plot was obtained for each sample and compared with the static compression test result. The results of the study indicate that the dynamic strength (with the exception of through the thickness loading of cross-ply laminates) and stiffness exhibit considerable increase as compared to the static values within the tested range of strain rates. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Therefore, by considering the specific attributes of these materials, having a proper knowledge of dynamic behavior as well as static behavior of them is necessary. In order to study the effects of strain rate on the behavior of the materials, special testing machines are needed. Most of the researches in this field are focused on applying real loading and gripping boundary conditions on the testing specimens. This paper discusses the experimental study on the in-plane shear behavior of unidirectional glass fiber-reinforced polymeric composite under quasi-static and intermediate strain rate loading conditions. The symmetric and balanced ??45?? composite laminates are manufactured for characterization of the in-plane shear properties (modulus and strength) at various strain rates. Specimens are tested under uni-axial tensile loading using a servo-hydraulic testing apparatus. For performing the practical tests, jig and fixture are designed and manufactured. The performance of the test jig is evaluated and found to be adequate for composites testing. Dynamic tests results are compared with static tests carried out on specimens with identical geometry. The experimental results show that the mechanical shear properties are quite sensitive to strain rate. Under dynamic loading, the failure shear strength increased with increasing the strain rate but the shear modulus decreased. Based on the results obtained from the experiments, empirical functions for expressing the mechanical shear properties are proposed in terms of shear strain rate. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The in-plane and the out-of-plane stiffness of the dispersed laminates match within 2% those of the baseline laminate. Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is used to select the stacking sequences with the desirable clustering and stiffness constraints. The results obtained demonstrate that introducing clustering had a negative effect on the maximum peak load recorded at different impact energies and also on the projected delamination area. Regarding damage tolerance, the residual compressive strength can be improved up to 30% with ply clustering. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The tensile strain required to initiate transverse cracking in the 90-deg ply was found to depend on the thickness of the 90-deg layer. For n ≤ 3 delamination was initiated at the edge of the coupon. The onset of delamination occurred before or after transverse cracking, depending on the laminate construction. For n ≥ 4 delamination at the 25/90 interface was initiated across the entire width of the coupon by the formation of a transverse crack in the 90-deg ply. In some laminate constructions the location of specimen separation during final fracture was associated with the growth and coalescence of edge delaminations under either incrementally increasing or constant strain cyclic loading. Comparisons of experiments to the fracture sequence predictions by stress and energy analysis are made to assess our ability to account for the ply thickness dependence of fracture in these laminates.",

The conventional techniques for strengthening of substandard bridges are costly, time consuming, and labor intensive. Many new techniques have used the lightweight, high strength, and the corrosion resistance of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) laminates for repair and retrofit applications. The load-carrying capacity of a steel-concrete composite girder can be improved significantly by epoxy bonding carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) laminates to its tension flange. This paper presents the results of a study on the behavior of steel-concrete composite girders strengthened with CFRP sheets under static loading. A total of three large-scale composite girders made of W355×13.6 A36 steel beam and 75-mm thick by 910-mm wide concrete slab were prepared and tested. The thickness of the CFRP sheet was constant and a different number of layers of 1, 3, and 5 were used in the specimens. The test results showed that epoxy-bonded CFRP sheet increased the ultimate load-carrying capacity of steel-concrete composite girders and the behavior can be conservatively predicted by traditional methods.",

GLARE laminates can show a fibre critical or aluminium critical failure mode. The dent depth after impact of FML is approximately equal to that of the monolithic aluminium alloy. The damage size of FML after impact is considerably smaller than of glass and carbon fibre composite materials. The maximum central deflection during low velocity impact loading is approximately equal to the static deflection at the same energy (i.e., area under load-deflection curve). This deflection can be modelled using the simplified Von K??rm??n equations neglecting the contribution of the in-plane displacements. For these calculations the shape of the specimen under load was measured. This shape was approximately independent of the central deflection and the type of material.",

A finite element-based numerical scheme is also developed to evaluate the critical strain energy release rate, GIc, associated with matrix micro-cracking, a parameter that previously required fitting with experimental data. Furthermore, the prediction scheme is improved to account for the statistical variation of GIc within the material volume by using a two-parameter Weibull distribution. The variation of GIc with increasing crack density is also accounted for based on reported experimental evidence. The simulated results for carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy cross-ply laminates demonstrate the ability of the improved model to predict the evolution of multidirectional ply cracking. By integrating this damage evolution model with the synergistic damage mechanics approach for stiffness degradation, the stress-strain response of the studied laminates is predicted. Finally, biaxial stress envelopes for ply crack initiation and pre-determined stiffness degradation levels are predicted to serve as representative examples of stiffness-based design and failure criterion.",

It consists of alternating layers of aluminium and glass-fibre-reinforced prepreg. The material can be sensitive to delamination buckling, which occurs when a partially delaminated panel is subjected to a compressive force. The interaction of local buckling and extension of the delaminated zone typically results in a decrease of the residual strength and, eventually, in a collapse of the structure. This phenomenon can be observed in experimental tests, but numerical analyses are needed to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms and the critical parameters. In this paper, some experimental observations are discussed regarding delamination buckling in Glare and, on the basis of these observations, a numerical model is constructed at a meso-mechanical level. In this approach, solid-like shell elements are used to model the individual layers. They are connected by interface elements, which are capable of modelling delamination between the layers. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

During the study, novel experimental methods were developed in order to address several challenges specific to 3D composite materials. The results show that, while the different binder volume fractions of 3% and 6% have only a small effect on the in-plane stiffness (warp and weft direction), its effect on the delamination resistance in plate bending experiments is considerable.

Different loading options (e.g. same stress and same force), layers of CFRP sheets, and lay-ups of laminates (single and double sides) were considered. A series of experimental tests were performed to determine the effectiveness of the CFRP bonding on prolonging fatigue crack initiation life, preventing fatigue crack propagation and extending fatigue life of the hybrid laminates. Three distinct failure modes, classified as delamination, delamination bending and fiber breakage, were observed in the tests. It is shown that the loading conditions and CFRP thickness are the critical parameters affecting the failure modes and fatigue resistance. The crack initiation life and fatigue life of fiber-metal laminates (FMLs) increase by factors ranging from 1.06 to 1.96 and 1.17 to 2.07, respectively, relative to monolithic steel plates under the same force condition; whereas decrease by factors ranging from 0.63 to 0.89 and 0.28 to 0.61 under the same stress condition.

          "abstract": "This study confirms the fact that a special toughened 90?? ply, when serving as the core layer in cross-plied and angle-plied laminates, has a definite effect on matrix cracking and threshold delamination in the laminate. The 90?? oly of the IM6/5245C graphite/epoxy and S2/5245C glass/epoxy laminates was hybridized into IM6/3501-6 graphite/epoxy laminates for this study. The results clearly indicate that the hybridized laminate can withstand significantly higher loads before the onset of laminate splitting, delamination, and final failure. The delay in splitting and delamination is attributed to a reduction in the mismatch of both moduli and thermal expansion coefficient in the direction normal to the free edge at the interface between the 90?? ply and its adjacent ply. ?? 1990.",

Matrix cracking parallel to the fibres in the off-axis plies is the first intralaminar damage mode observed. These cracks are either arrested at the interface or cause interlaminar damage (delamination) due to high interlaminar stresses at the ply interface. This paper summarises recent theoretical modelling developed by the authors on stiffness property degradation and mechanical behaviour of general symmetric laminates with off-axis ply cracks and crack-induced delaminations. Closed-form analytical expressions are derived for Mode I, Mode II and the total strain energy release rates associated with these damage modes. Dependence of strain energy release rates on crack density, delamination area and ply orientation angle in balanced and unbalanced symmetric laminates is examined and discussed. Also, stiffness degradation due to various types of damage is predicted and analysed. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In such cases, carbon fibers are both the reinforcement and the sensor to detect damage in {CFRP} laminates. The damage-detecting method of {CFRP} laminates by electrical resistance measurement that are investigated in this study is made possible by attaching electrodes on the surface of the {CFRP} structures without special manufacturing. In this paper, we investigate the electrical resistance change as a damage parameter of fatigue damage such as the degradation of residual strength and stiffness. The measured stiffness and electrical resistance change during fatigue tests showed a very similar trend of change. This is because cumulative fatigue damage is represented by the degradation of residual stiffness; these damages also cause change in electrical resistance. Thus, we can use this change in electrical resistance as a damage parameter. We also predict the future damage of composite laminates in fatigue loading from electrical resistance damage model by following a stiffness degradation model. Electrical resistance gradually increased as the stiffness reduced, and showed a very abrupt change when final fatigue failure was imminent. The predicted value showed good agreement with the experimental data except in the final stage, where stiffness and electrical resistance changed abruptly.",

Various influential factors associated with ply waviness, such as the waviness geometry, the off-axis angle, the extent of wavy region, and the waviness pattern, are incorporated in the multi-parameter model. Analytical results for the Young’s moduli, the shear moduli and the Poisson’s ratios of wavy fiber composite laminates are obtained and discussed for a specific range of fiber volume fractions and two different lay-ups.

Polished. thin sections removed from plain glass fiber/nylon composites and their corresponding fiber-metal laminates indicated that the prevailing microstructure was strongly. dependent on the rate of cooling from the melt. Mode I and Mode 11 interlaminar fracture tests on the plain glass fiber reinforced nylon laminates indicated that the values of G(Ic) and G(IIc) averaged approximately 1100 J/m(2) and 3700 J/m(2) respectively at all cooling rates. The degree of adhesion between the aluminum alloy and composite substrates was investigated using the single cantilever beam geometry. Here, the measured values of G, were. similar in magnitude to the Mode I interlaminar fracture energy of the composite, tending to increase slightly with increasing cooling rate. The tensile and flexural fracture properties of the plain composites and the fiber metal laminates were found to increase by between 10% and 20% as the cooling rate was increased by two orders of magnitude. This effect was attributed to over-aging of the aluminum alloy plies at elevated temperature during cooling. Finally, fiber metal laminates based on glass fiber/nylon composites were shown to exhibit an excellent resistance to low velocity impact loading. Damage, in the form of delamination, fiber fracture, matrix cracking in the composite plies, and plastic deformation and fracture in the aluminum layers, was observed under localized impact loading. Here, the fast-cooled fiber metal laminates offered superior post-impact mechanical properties at low and intermediate impact energies, yet very similar results under high impact energies.",

In this work, an iterative approach is applied to identify the effect of specimen thickness on traction-separation behavior in the bridging zone. Double cantilever beam specimens (DCB) with embedded arrays of wavelength-multiplexed fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are subjected to monotonic mode I fracture loading. As processed specimens with thicknesses h = 2, 4, 8 and 10 mm as well as specimens of h = 4 mm milled down from the 8 and 10 mm are tested. Non-homogeneous strain distributions in the vicinity of the interlaminar crack plane are locally monitored by means of embedded FBGs. The measured strain data are used to quantify the bridging tractions associated with each specimen thickness and consequently the energy release rate (ERR) due to the bridging. The results show that the bridging zone length and the ERR at the plateau level increase with specimen thickness while the results for all specimens with h = 4 are the same thus excluding any processing effects. Moreover, the maximum stress of traction-opening in the bridging zone and crack opening displacement at the end of the zone are independent of thickness. In contrast, the rate of tractions decay depends on the specimen thickness in that it decreases with thickness scaling. Thus the so-called bridging law is not a material parameter. The identified traction-separation relations are employed in a cohesive zone model to predict fracture of DCB specimens with different thicknesses.",

In general, environmental degradation is observed as matrix cracking and erosion that leads to deterioration of matrix-dominated properties. In this work, cross-ply laminates of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy were subjected to environmental degradation using controlled ultraviolet radiation (UV) and moisture condensation and the post-exposure mechanical properties were evaluated through elastic modulus and failure strength measurements. Additionally, both degraded and undegraded were subjected to cyclic fatigue loading to investigate possible synergistic effects between environmental degradation and mechanical fatigue. Experimental results show that the degradation results in reduced failure strength. Greater effects of degradation are observed when the materials are tested under flexural as opposed to uniaxial loading. Based on strength measurements and scanning electron microscopy, we identified various damage modes resulting from exposure to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and cyclic loading. The principal mechanisms that lead to reduction in mechanical properties are the loss of fiber confinement due to matrix erosion, due to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and weakened/ cracked ply interfaces due to mechanical fatigue. An empirical relationship was established to quantify the specific influence of different damage mechanisms and to clarify the effects of various degradation conditions.",

Laminates of carbon/polyetheretherketone (PEEK), carbon/epoxy and glass/epoxy were exposed to heat intensities of between 8 and 60 kW m-2 on one side. Time to the appearance of visible defects, deterioration in mechanical properties, temperature increase and mass loss were studied. A simple relationship was established between time to appearance of defects and heat intensity, laminate thickness and type of material. The deterioration in mechanical properties in the PEEK laminates was probably caused by delamination, whereas chemical degradation and delamination were the most important factors in the epoxy laminates. No deterioration in mechanical properties was observed before visible defects appeared on the unidirectional laminates. ?? 1992.",

          "abstract": "This paper deals with the computational modeling of delamination and the prediction of delamination growth in laminated composites. In the analysis of post-buckled delaminations, an important parameter is the distribution of the local strain-energy release rate along the delamination front. A study using virtual crack closure technique is made for three-dimensional finite-element models of circular delaminations embedded in woven and non-woven composite laminates. The delamination is embedded at different depths along the thickness direction of the laminates. The issue of symmetry boundary conditions is discussed. It is found that fibre orientation of the plies in the delaminated part play an important role in the distribution of the local strain-energy release rate. This implies that the popular use of quarter models in order to save computational effort is unjustified and will lead to erroneous results. Comparison is made with experimental results and growth of the delamination front with fatigue cycling is predicted. A methodology for the prediction of delamination areas and directions using evolution criteria derived from test coupon data is also described. It is found that evolution criteria based on components of the strain-energy release rate predict the rate of delamination growth much better than evolution criteria based on the total strain energy release rate. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model uses a cohesive zone law that is derived from quasi-static R-curves to determine the bridging energy applied in the bridged region. Timoshenko beam theory and an iterative self-consistent scheme are used to calculate the bridging tractions and displacements. After applying the bridging model to crack propagation data the scatter in the data was significantly reduced and clear trends were observed as a function of temperature that were not apparent previously. This indicated that the model appropriately accounted for the bridging in the experiments.

          "abstract": "In the last two decades, the use of advanced composite materials such as Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP) in strengthening reinforced concrete (RC) structural elements has been increasing. Research and design guidelines concluded that externally bonded FRP could increase the capacity of RC elements efficiently. However, the linear stress-strain characteristics of FRP up to failure and lack of yield plateau have a negative impact on the overall ductility of the strengthened RC elements. Use of hybrid FRP laminates, which consist of a combination of either carbon and glass fibers, or glass and aramid fibers, changes the behaviour of the material to a non-linear behaviour. This paper aims to study the performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened by hybrid FRP laminates. This paper presents an experimental program conducted to study the behaviour of RC beams strengthened with hybrid fiber reinforced polymer (HFRP) laminates. The program consists of a total of twelve T-beams with overall dimensions equal to 460 ?? 300 ?? 3250 mm. The beams were tested under cyclic loading up to failure to examine its flexural behaviour. Different reinforcement ratios, fiber directions, locations and combinations of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates were attached to the beams to determine the best strengthening scheme. Different percentages of steel reinforcement were also used. An analytical model based on the stress-strain characteristics of concrete, steel and FRP was adopted. Recommendations and design guidelines of RC beams strengthened by FRP and HFRP laminates are introduced. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A numerical model has been elaborated in order to simulate the different impact damage types developing during low velocity/low energy impact. The three current damage types: matrix cracking, fiber failure and delamination, are simulated. Inter-laminar damage, i.e. interface delamination, is conventionally simulated using interface elements based on fracture mechanics. Intra-laminar damage, i.e. matrix cracks, is simulated using interface elements based on failure criterion. Fiber failure is simulated using degradation in the volume elements. The originality of this model is to simulate permanent indentation after impact with a &quot; plastic-like&quot; model introduced in the matrix cracking elements. This model type is based on experimental observations showing matrix cracking debris which block crack closure. Lastly, experimental validation is performed, which demonstrates the model&#039;s satisfactory relevance in simulating impact damage. This acceptable match between experiment and modeling confirms the interest of the novel approach proposed in this paper to describe the physics behind permanent indentation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Foremost among the differences is the characteristic damage state. [90m/0n]s laminates form antisymmetric or staggered microcracks while [0n/90m]s laminates form symmetric microcracks. To explain observed differences, this paper presents a variational mechanics analysis of the stresses and the energy release rate in a [[90m/0n]s laminate having staggered microcracks. The new analysis and a previous analysis of [0m/90n]s laminates are used to assess the effect of laminate structure on the mechanical properties and failure properties of cross-ply laminates. The findings are as follows. (1) A given level of microcracking damage causes a greater amount of degradation in mechanical properties in [[90m/0n]s laminates than in the corresponding [0n/90m]s laminates. (2) Although [[90m/0n]s laminates will initiate microcracks at lower loads, the corresponding [0n/90m]s laminates will develop more microcracks after continued loading. (3) A bending effect present in [90m/0n]s laminates but not in [0n/90m]s laminates promotes mode I delamination in [90m/0n]s laminates. ?? 1992.",

Ply cracks and delamination extended near the hole with an increasing number of cycles, and the reflection spectrum from the FBG sensor was distorted. Moreover, debonding growth of the FBG sensor was observed. This study then estimated laminate damage pattern from reflection spectra and investigated the influence of the sensor debonding on damage identification. The debonding length was estimated from the spectrum simulated with a given debonding length and was successfully identified only when an appropriate damage pattern was assumed. Moreover, greater debonding induced invalid damage-pattern estimates, even if the debonding length was given in the estimation. The damage identification for simulations and for experiments required half of the intact gage section. These estimates indicated that information on the damage pattern disappeared from the spectrum shape because of debonding. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) usage in the aerospace industry has been steadily increasing due to its superior material properties such as high strength, low weight, high resistance to corrosion, and a low thermal expansion coefficient. In addition, CFRP parts are produced near-net-shape, a process that eliminates rough machining operations. However, machining operations such as drilling, side milling, and slotting are still necessary to give the CFRP parts their final shape. A majority of the studies on machining of CFRP laminates are on drilling. The number of studies on milling of CFRPs is quite limited. In this study, a mechanistic cutting force model for milling CFRPs is proposed based on experimentally collected cutting force data during slot milling of unidirectional CFRP laminates using two different polycrystalline diamond cutters. Cutting force coefficients in radial and tangential directions are calculated as a function of fiber cutting angle. The relationship is represented with simple sine functions. The mechanistic model is shown to be capable of predicting cutting forces during milling of multidirectional CFRP laminates. The experimental milling force measurements and predicted milling forces agree well with each other. Surface milling experiments were also conducted to investigate the relationship between milling forces and surface quality. Some suggestions on surface milling of CFRP laminates are given based on these observations. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Dry and moisture-saturated specimens were tested over the temperature range -50??C to 100??C. Evaluation methods based on load/displacement and load measurements were employed. In pure model II the critical strain-energy release rate drops with moisture content and increase in temperature. In mixed model the critical strain-energy release rate also decreases with moisture content but no general trends in the dependence on temperature is observed. The critical strain-energy release rate in pure model I is unafected by changes in moisture content and was found to increase slightly at elevated temperatures. During crack propagation, enhanced fiber bridging due to increases in temperature and moisture content promotes R-curve behaviour in the pure mode 1 tests. The resulting mode mixity of the mixed-mode bending (MMB) tests is found to be severely affected by the evaluation methods. Methods based on load measurements only are considered to give unreliable strain-energy release rates as found to be non-linear even prior to crack growth.

It is found that the behaviour of these laminates is dominated by damage mechanisms such as delamination and fibre shear-out. A force-based analytical model is developed to predict the onset of delamination. Under single monotonic loading, the analytical model not only describes the elastic behaviour up to the occurrence of delamination and predicts the critical load level at which delamination occurs, but also describes the post-delamination behaviour with modified stiffnesses. It is observed that the increase of laminate thickness increases the load level of the incipient delamination and is proportional to that of laminate load-bearing capability. Under repeat loading, it is found that the indentation laws are dependent not only on materials but also geometry, and that delamination has no permanent affect on the indentation laws. It is noted that the ultimate static resistance of S-glass/phenolic laminates when normalized with reference to thickness are much more superior than that of E-glass/polyester laminates. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The porosity of CF-reinforced polymers is a very important topic for practical applications since there is a direct correlation between void content and mechanical properties. In this study, inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulphide (IF-WS2) lubricant nanoparticles were used to manufacture PPS/IF-WS2/CF laminates via melt-blending and hot-press processing, and the effect of IF-WS2 loading on the quality, thermal and mechanical behaviour of the hybrid composites was investigated. The addition of IF-WS2 improved fiber impregnation, resulting in lower degree of porosity and increased delamination resistance, compression and flexural properties; their reinforcement effect was greater at temperatures above the glass transition (Tg). IF-WS2 contents higher than 0.5 wt % increased Tg and the heat deflection temperature while reduced the coefficient of thermal expansion. The multiscale laminates exhibited higher ignition point and notably reduced peak heat release rate compared to PPS/CF. The coexistence of micro- and nano-scale fillers resulted in synergistic effects that enhanced the stiffness, strength, thermal conductivity and flame retardancy of the matrix. The results presented herein demonstrate that the IF-WS2 are very promising nanofillers to improve the thermomechanical properties of conventional thermoplastic/CF composites.",

          "abstract": "The characterisation of the damage state of composite structures is often performed using the acoustic behaviour of the composite system. This behaviour is expected to change significantly as the damage is accumulating in the composite. It is indisputable that different damage mechanisms are activated within the composite laminate during loading scenario. These &quot;damage entities&quot; are acting in different space and time scales within the service life of the structure and may be interdependent. It has been argued that different damage mechanisms attribute distinct acoustic behaviour to the composite system. Loading of cross-ply laminates in particular leads to the accumulation of distinct damage mechanisms, such as matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fibre rupture at the final stage of loading. As highlighted in this work, the acoustic emission activity is directly linked to the structural health state of the laminate. At the same time, significant changes on the wave propagation characteristics are reported and correlated to damage accumulation in the composite laminate. In the case of cross ply laminates, experimental tests and numerical simulations indicate that, typical to the presence of transverse cracking and/or delamination, is the increase of the pulse velocity and the transmission efficiency of a propagated ultrasonic wave, an indication that the intact longitudinal plies act as wave guides, as the transverse ply deteriorates. Further to transverse cracking and delamination, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing the catastrophic failure of the composite and is expected to be directly linked to the acoustic behaviour of the composite, as the stiffness loss results to the velocity decrease of the propagated wave. In view of the above, the scope of the current work is to assess the efficiency of acoustic emission and ultrasonic transmission as a combined methodology for the assessment of the introduced damage and furthermore as a structural health monitoring tool. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "A first-order shear deformable plate theory-based method is developed to calculate the strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor of a non-homogeneous delaminated composite plate under a general three-dimensional (3-D) loading condition. By modeling the delaminated plate as two shear deformable sub-laminates on either side of the delaminated plane, the strain energy release rate is expressed in terms of three concentrated forces at the crack tip and their corresponding compliance coefficients. The simple expression of strain energy release rate makes the mode decomposition under complicated loading situation possible with the aid of two supplementary continuum analyses. To illustrate the present method, a plain strain delamination problem of laminates is examined, and the closed-form expressions of strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor are obtained. It is found that the available solutions, such as the ones based on the classical plate theory, can be recovered from the present solutions by simply neglecting the transverse shear force. The relationship between the global and local decompositions is further established, and the accuracy of the present solutions is examined by comparing with numerical results of boundary element method. With inclusion of transverse shear deformation in the formulation, more accurate and explicit predictions of the strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor of delaminated composite plate are achieved by the present method, especially when a laminate has a relatively low transverse shear modulus or moderate thickness. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "This paper focuses on the damage and fracture process of CFRP cross-ply laminates under on-axis and off-axis cyclic loading. On the semi-log S-N curves obtained by fatigue tests, fatigue fracture is described by a straight line and the fatigue limit is not recognized clearly. In the on-axis fatigue tests, fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies develops in addition to ply-cracking damage in 90?? plies. The fiber-peeling damage was described by peeling-off of fiber bundles from the specimen surface after micro-scale damage of matrix resin and fiber-matrix interface. Most of the ply-cracking damage develops at an early stage of stress cycles, and slightly increases during fatigue, while the fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies initiates from the edges of 0?? plies and evolves in the whole area of laminates with an increase in stress cycles. The fatigue fracture seems to occur when the 0?? plies lose their load carrying capacity by the evolution of the fiber-peeling damage. In the off-axis fatigue tests, the fatigue fracture is caused by the initiation and evolution of ply-cracking damage and succeeding delamination. It is concluded that the fatigue strength is governed by the fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies under on-axis cyclic loading and by the ply-cracking damage and delamination under off-axis cyclic loading. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The compatibility between the resin film and the prepreg matrix and the application of co-RFI process were investigated based on the resin flowability, glass transition temperature of cured resin, processing quality of laminate, and variation in resin modulus on cocured interphase region measured by nanoindentation. Furthermore, mode I (G(IC)), mode II (G(IIC)) delamination fracture toughness, and flexural strength and modulus were measured to evaluate the mechanical properties of cocured laminates with different prepreg materials. The experimental results show that thickness and fiber volume fraction of co-RFI laminates with the four kinds of prepreg materials are similar to those of prepreg laminates and RFI laminate with acceptable differences. In addition, there are no obvious defects in co-RFI laminates. Moreover, the reduced modulus of resin at cocured interface and glass transition temperature values of the mixed resin reflect good compatibility between prepreg matrix resin and RFI resin. The G(IC), G(IIC) values, and flexural performances of cocured laminates lie between and even exceed those of prepreg laminates and RFI laminates, indicating no weakening effect in the cocured interface. Therefore, the co-RFI process is believed to effectively fabricate composite with low cost and it can be applied using various prepreg systems. POLYM. COMPOS., 34:2008-2018, 2013.

In addition, CFRP parts are produced near-net-shape, a process that eliminates rough machining operations. However, machining operations such as drilling, side milling, and slotting are still necessary to give the CFRP parts their final shape. A majority of the studies on machining of CFRP laminates are on drilling. The number of studies on milling of CFRPs is quite limited. In this study, a mechanistic cutting force model for milling CFRPs is proposed based on experimentally collected cutting force data during slot milling of unidirectional CFRP laminates using a polycrystalline diamond cutter. Cutting force coefficients in radial and tangential directions are calculated as a function of fiber cutting angle. The mechanistic model is shown to be capable of predicting cutting forces during milling of multidirectional CFRP laminates and capable of investigating stability of machining. ?? 2012 The Authors.",

          "abstract": "A summary of several studies of delamination in tapered composite laminates with internal ply-drops is presented. Initial studies used 2D FE models to calculate interlaminar stresses at the ply-ending locations in linear tapered laminates under tension loading. Strain energy release rates for delamination in these laminates indicated that delamination would likely start at the juncture of the tapered and thin regions and grow unstably in both directions. Tests of glass/epoxy and graphite/epoxy linear tapered laminates under axial tension delaminated as predicted. Nonlinear tapered specimens were cut from a full-size helicopter rotor hub and were tested under combined constant axial tension and cyclic transverse bending loading to simulate the loading experienced by a rotor hub flexbeam in flight. For all the tested specimens, delamination began at the tip of the outermost dropped-ply group and grew first toward the tapered region. A 2D FE model was created that duplicated the test flexbeam layup, geometry, and loading. Surface strains calculated by the model agreed very closely with the measured surface strains in the specimens. The delamination patterns observed in the tests were simulated in the model by releasing pairs of multi-point constraints (MPCs) along those interfaces. Strain energy release rates associated with the delamination growth were calculated for several configurations and using two different FE analysis codes. Calculations from the codes agreed very closely. The strain energy release rate results were used with material characterization data to predict fatigue delamination onset lives for nonlinear tapered flexbeams with two different ply-dropping schemes. The predicted curves agreed well with the test data for each case studied. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Mechanical characterisation tests were conducted on bulk composite specimens to determine various properties such as interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and transverse tension strength which clearly illustrate the difference in fibre/matrix interfacial adhesion. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the difference in fracture surfaces, the untreated fibre composites showing interfacial failure while the treated fibre composites showed matrix failure. No clear differences were found for the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and Young&#039;s modulus of the FRMLs despite the differences in the bulk composite properties. A reduction of 7.5% in the apparent value of the ILSS was identified for the untreated fibre laminates by both three-point and five-point bend tests. Residual strength and blunt notch tests showed remarkable increases in strength for the untreated fibre specimens over the treated ones. Increases of up to 20% and 14% were found for specimens with a circular hole and saw cut, respectively. The increase in strength is attributed to the promotion of fibre/matrix splitting and large delamination zones in the untreated fibre specimens owing to the weak fibre/matrix interface.

In this present work, pure resin plate and GFRP composite laminates with stacking sequence of [0(0)](6), are fabricated using Hand lay-up method. During the layup a Teflon tape of width 45 mm is kept in the mid plane of the laminate which serves as an initiator for delamination during loading. As per ASTM STD D5528 01 DCB (Double Cantilever Beam) specimens are cut out from the laminates and are subjected to tensile test in the transverse direction along with acoustic emission monitoring. While loading, Markings are made on the sides of the specimen to track the crack front using a magnifying lens. Parametric analysis is performed on the AE data obtained during crack propagation to discriminate the failure modes. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) enabled the calculation of frequency content of each damage mechanism. Further STFFT analysis is performed on a portion of the waveforms representing the dominant frequency content pertaining to each damage mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Delamination growth predictions in previous peridynamic models were based on the assumption of constant critical stretch for each interlayer bond interaction. This study presents a new approach to terminate the interlayer peridynamic bonds. The critical stretch of a bond is implicitly determined by using the measured critical energy release rate values for different modes of deformation, and can vary depending on the degree of deformation. The bond failure occurs when the amount of energy required to remove the bonds across a unit surface equals the critical energy release rate of the interface between the two layers. This approach is applied to model delamination growth in double cantilever beam (DCB) (Mode I) and transverse crack tension (TCT) (Mode II dominated) specimens. The peridynamic predictions correlate well with the numerical and experimental results available in the literature.",

From the experimental results for the onset of delamination, similar fatigue behaviour was observed at a low number of cycles for both matrices and both fracture modes, while in fatigue at a high number of cycles, a higher fatigue limit was obtained in the composite with the modified resin (higher toughness) for both fracture modes.

          "abstract": "Diffuse delamination induced by transverse cracking is usually the secondary damage mode when a composite laminate experiences tensile loading. The fist damage mechanism in such a laminate is transverse cracking which has been widely investigated with both analytical methods and &quot; mechanism-based&quot; constitutive laws. Delamination induced by matrix cracking is already studied extensively by analytical approaches, however, a proper homogenization way has not been proposed yet. In this paper, a modification to an available cohesive constitutive law is proposed which is capable of considering the effect of diffuse delamination without the necessity of consideration of an actual discontinuity between the layers. The proposed constitutive law is then compared against its equivalent models containing interlaminar discontinuity and it is shown that the obtained results from both models are in good. Then the proposed modification is used in Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimen and the obtained results are found coincident with the equivalent model with diffuse discontinuities at the interface. Finally, a damaged cross-ply laminate is modeled under the boundary conditions of tensile loading and also 3-point bending with and without the proposed cohesive modification. In tensile loading, the results of both cases are similar; however, it is shown that in bending, the unmodified cohesive law predicts the lateral stiffness larger than the proposed modification. The lateral stiffness of the equivalent model with discontinuities as crack indicates that the proposed modification is able to properly consider the lateral stiffness decrease. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Fibre bridging, which can overestimate the measured fracture energies and conceal the strain rate effect, has been avoided by manufacturing woven and unidirectional (but with a small amount of transversal E-glass) carbon fibre epoxy composites. Double Cantilever Beam tests have been performed from 8.3??10-5m/s to 0.19m/s loading rates, measuring crack length and specimen aperture by a high speed camera. Results over the analysed loading rates have shown an interlaminar fracture energy release rate reduction of 19% for woven reinforcement, and 31% for unidirectional. The main GIC reduction on the unidirectional composite (a 24% reduction) is given when increasing testing loading rate from quasi-static to a dynamic (approximately 0.05m/s). This reduction has been associated to a change in the crack growth behaviour from quasi-static to dynamic loading rates, which in fractographic analysis is found as less fibre/matrix interface failure and larger matrix brittle cracking. A rate parameter called crack rate has been defined from the time derivative of the crack length, which is measured experimentally. This rate parameter allows the comparative study of GIC values obtained at different loading rates and crack lengths.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the development of an experimental methodology based on acoustic emission wave detection for determining delamination onset and propagation in carbon fibre composite materials under quasi-static and fatigue loading. Delamination was investigated in quasi-static interlaminar fracture testing over a wide range of mixed-mode ratios (GII /GT = 0, 0.3, 0.5 and 1) for unidirectional and woven samples. An acoustic emission wave detection method was developed to detect delamination onset, and the corresponding fracture toughness was computed. Interlaminar fracture toughness was also calculated by beam theory and from finite element analysis with the virtual crack closure technique. The mechanical testing results, acoustic emission monitoring and numerical model’s interlaminar fracture toughness were used to define delamination initiation criteria by drawing two-dimensional envelopes corresponding to GC = f(GII /GT ). The acoustic emission wave detection method showed damage accumulation before observable crack propagation, and its failure envelope corresponded to lower fracture energies than the standard test and modelling methods. Mode I fatigue testing with acoustic emission monitoring was performed on the woven samples for different energy release rate ratios (GIMAX /GIC = 0.3–0.8). A first series of samples were tested to construct an onset delamination fatigue curve ΔG = f(N). A second series of samples were used to study the cumulative acoustic emission energy distribution during delamination growth. An unsupervised pattern recognition methodology is presented for crack opening and closing testing, in order to discriminate between fatigue signal noise and acoustic emission signals emitted from crack initiation and crack growth. Correlations were observed between the acoustic emission energy distribution, the load range, the delamination length and the crack growth rate.",

This ‘mutual integral’ approach, for generalized plane-strain conditions, is based on the application of the path-independent J integral to a linear combination of three solutions: one, the problem of the laminate to be solved by using the quasi 3D finite element method; the second, an ‘auxiliary’ solution with a known asymptotic singular solution; and the third, the particular solution due to the out-of-plane loading. A comparison with the exact solutions is made to determine the accuracy and efficiency of this numerical method. With this ‘mutual integral’ approach, it was found that the calculated mixed-mode stress intensity factors of the free-edge delamination crack remain relatively constant as the crack propagates into the laminate. It was also found that the fracture criterion based on the mixed-mode stress intensity factors is more consistent with the experimental observations than the criterion based on the total energy release rate, and hence demonstrates the importance of the ability to calculate each individual component of the stress intensity factors. Furthermore, it was found that the fracture toughness measurements from double cantilever beam specimens can be used directly to predict the onset of delamination crack growth between two dissimilar laminae. By using these fracture toughness measurements from the double cantilever beam specimens, some examples are given to show that the fracture criterion based on the mixed-mode stress intensity factors can accurately predict the failure load for various laminates under tensile loading conditions.",

The key idea is to model delamination growth at any time instant within a cyclic loading, rather than the cycle-averaged growth kinetics. First, some existing models are briefly reviewed for the fatigue delamination growth analysis of composite materials. Following this, two hypotheses are given for the derivation of the subcycle delamination growth model: (1) delamination growth does not happen during the unloading path and (2) delamination growth does not happen when the applied loading is below a reference level during the loading path. Mathematical expression is given for the calculation of delamination growth rate. Next, the extension of the proposed model is discussed to use both stress intensity factor and energy release rate as the driving force parameters, which are widely used in the open literature. Finally, the model predictions are compared with extensive experimental data under different stress ratios for model validation. One of the advantages of the proposed model is that the stress ratio dependent delamination growth can be predicted.

The resistance change due to mechanical loading was more pronounced for the laminates with the modified matrices.

          "abstract": "During the experimental characterization of the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of multidirectional composite laminates, the crack tends to migrate from the propagation plane (crack jumping) invalidating the tests. In an earlier numerical study . [9], we reported that this problem could be eliminated by choosing the appropriate bending stiffness of the beam arms.In the current paper, six stacking sequences were defined numerically and checked experimentally to validate the methodology presented in the numerical study. The results showed that crack jumping could be avoided by increasing the stiffness of the crack arms. Micrographies of the tested specimens showed that the delamination was not a perfect interlaminar fracture, as is usually considered. Instead, the propagation of delamination occurred with fiber tearing. The toughness values showed a dependency upon both the amount of fiber bridging and the interface angles. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Damage mechanisms of hybrid composites with nonwoven carbon tissue (NWCT) are investigated under a quasi-static indentation loading condition with a steel ball as an indentor. The damage level corresponds to an initial stage of damage due to an indentation loading, which leads to a strength degradation of the composite. The hybrid composites consist of the CFRP prepreg and the NWCT prepreg, which are made by interleaving the NWCT prepreg into the CFRP layer interfaces. Four kinds of cross-ply laminates are studied; i.e., CFRP laminates ([05/905/05] and [03/903/03/903/03]) and hybrid laminates ([05//905//05] and [03//903//03//903//03]). Here, the symbol &quot;//&quot; means that the NWCT prepreg is located at an interface between CFRP layers. The hybrid effect is examined by investigating the delamination area and the absorption energy of two cross-ply laminates. As it has been recognized that the quasi-static indentation damage agrees well with the low-velocity impact test results, the present static test results can then be used to understand the damage mechanism of low-energy impact. The damaged parts of the specimens were observed by the deply technique and the cut method which used a microscope. The NWCT interleaving&#039;s effect was clarified based on the observation of the damage for the hybrid specimen&#039;s cross-sections after indentation testing. The delamination area of the hybrid composites was reduced to about a half of the CFRP&#039;s by indentation loading. It was clarified that the Mode II interlaminar fracture is predominant in the delamination by the impact.",

          "abstract": "This paper identifies the material and processing parameters which most significantly influence the development of in-plane waviness in laminates. Thin laminates of unidirectional, T300 carbon-fiber/polysulfone matrix prepreg were processed in an autoclave and a custom-made water-cooled chamber, which allowed fast cooling rates. Multivariate regression analysis of process-induced waviness was performed for combinations of the select process variables and their interactions to identify those factors responsible for waviness development. Of the eight parameters investigated - hold temperature, hold time, pressure, length, width, thickness, cooling rate, and tool plate material - only three affected the development of fiber waviness: length, cooling rate, and tool plate material. Length affects not only the number of wrinkles and wrinkle distribution, but also the average amplitude of the waviness. Cooling rate affects the wavelength and amplitude of the waviness, as well as the number of wrinkles. Tool plate material primarily affects the number of wrinkles, without showing a significant effect on the average wave geometry. There is also an interaction between tool plate material and cooling rate in producing fiber waviness. For the three relevant parameters, the possible waviness-inducing mechanisms are tool plate/part coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch, temporal temperature gradients (or cooling rates), and spatial temperature gradients. The tool plate/part CTE mismatch proved to be the most important mechanism driving fiber waviness in plates, although changes in cooling rates also dramatically affected the quantity of waviness which developed. Spatial temperature gradients were negligible for this study. The tool plate/part CTE mismatch-driven axial buckling loads on the fibers were substantial in the outermost laminate plies, or skin, but negligible in the laminate core. Waviness was limited to the surface or skin plies, even in identically-processed thick laminates. This study confirmed that if the fibers experience axial loads - albeit a small fraction of their Young&#039;s modulus - while the matrix is unable to provide some level of transverse fiber support, the fibers will microbuckle resulting in waviness (in-plane or out-of-plane depending upon the laminate constraint).",

This study presents an idealized computational model for flexible [0??/90??] polyethylene fiber-reinforced laminates and show how the model can simulate actual impact tests conducted on the laminates. As these materials are viscoelastic, accurate modeling of their impact and perforation responses requires the formulation of constitutive equations representing such behavior. The material is idealized as networks of one-dimensional pin-jointed fiber elements defined by viscoelastic constitutive relations. Three-element viscoelastic Zener models are used as they are simple yet sufficient to account for the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular bonds, as well as viscous slippage between molecular chains, on the mechanical properties of oriented polymeric fibers. The effects of delamination in laminates are also taken into consideration by modeling flexible laminates as two fiber network layers bonded to each other at corresponding element cross-over points in the adjacent layers. Inter-ply bonding is represented by infinitesimal rigid links which break when the inter-ply bond strength is exceeded resulting in delamination between the plies. Predictions of residual velocity, development of deformation and delamination correlate well with experimental results. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This paper presents a methodology with which to model such migration. Firstly, the interlaminar shear at a delamination front were partitioned into axial and transverse modes, the mode-mixity of which was controlled by the mismatch between this front and the ply directions. An element formulation was presented which utilised this mismatch. Consequently, delamination migration was shown to have ensued when the transverse mode exceeded a critical mode-mixity Giii/GT=0.22. This approach was verified against experimental studies on width tapered end loaded split coupons by correlating the fracture morphology against mode-mixity. In particular, the orientation of the cusps on the delamination surface were shown to be controlled by the relative dominance of the axial and transverse modes. This methodology provides a means to accurately and robustly model progressive delamination growth processes in composite structures.",

          "abstract": "An evenly and smoothly distributed abrasion wear, observed along the entire cutting edge of an uncoated carbide drill bit in drilling CFRPs, is due to the highly abrasive nature of the carbon fibres. A very few researchers have only quoted this wear mode as being responsible for giving rise to the rounding of the cutting edge, or its bluntness. However, this wear feature has seldom been investigated, unlike the conventional flank wear in practice. This paper offers a new approach in unveiling and introducing the cutting edge rounding (CER) - a latent wear characteristic as a measure of sharpness/bluntness - of uncoated cemented carbide tools during drilling CFRP composite laminates. Four different types of drills (conventional and specialised) were tested to assess the applicability and relevance of this new wear feature. Mechanical loads (drilling thrust and torque) were recorded, and the hole entry and exit delamination were quantified. For the utilised tools, the accruing magnitude of CER was also recorded, in parallel with studying their conventional flank wear. Very appreciable correlations between the CER and the drilling loads, and also the quantitative delamination results are observed. Results reveal that this new wear type develops almost similarly for the selected tools and is practically independent of their respective conventional flank wear patterns. Moreover, a distinct, non-zero magnitude of the CER for a very fresh tool state may provide researchers with some lucid information in further studying the results during wear tests, more emphatically. The CER correlations with quantitative delamination results are noticed quite comparable to those of the conventional flank wear via statistical linear regression analyses. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

All specimens delaminated along the interfaces between the continuous and discontinuous plies. Delamination starts immediately, and the rate is approximately constant. Different specimens delaminate at different rates. However, when the strain-energy-release-rate amplitudes are normalized by the values for delamination under static loading, the delamination rates for all the specimens of both glass and carbon epoxy are very similar. Terminated 0° plies are much more susceptible to delamination than ±45° plies. The number of plies terminated together has a large effect on delamination. Tapered sections with dropped plies are stronger than equivalent untapered sections with cut plies. Delamination at terminated plies can cause a significant reduction in fatigue strength, especially for carbon-fiber epoxy.",

A laminate, containing a starter crack, was bonded between aluminum bars. The ends of the bars were then loaded in opposite directions, parallel to the plane of the crack and normal to the beam length. Stable crack growth was achieved in carbon fiber material. Unidirectional carbon fiber composites showed Mode III critical strain energy release rates in the range 1??1-1??3 kJ/m2. The effects of laminate thickness, beam depth, and data reduction method were investigated. In addition, testing was conducted on angle-ply laminates. Unsuccessful tests were conducted on a tougher matrix thermoplastic composite. An edge delamination specimen was also investigated. [15?? i/ - 15?? i]S angle-ply laminates were fabricated with four implanted edge starter cracks. Both tension and compression tests were conducted. Difficulties in interpreting the results are discussed. The split cantilever beam and edge delamination results are compared. ?? 1988.",

In addition to the primary requirements of stiffness, strength, and ease of processing, wind blade materials must withstand severe fatigue loading under service environments. The large material volumes and cost constraints also lead to unusually thick plies and fabrics, as well as thick adhesive bonds, which, combined with relatively brittle, low cost resins, can exacerbate delamination related structural integrity issues found in most composites structures. Important differences in performance are shown for the major fiber and resin types of relevance to blades. Details of fabric construction, fiber content and ply drop and geometry can produce major differences in performance, particularly under fatigue loading. Materials and conditions are identified where particularly low strain damage failure can occur at high cycles.",

          "abstract": "Composite panels using virgin and recycled high-density polyethylene (VHDPE and RHDPE) and five types of natural fibers including four rice straw components (i.e., rice husk, rice straw leaf, rice straw stem, and whole rice straw) and wood fiber as control were made by melt compounding and compression molding. Fiber characteristics and the influences of fiber type and loading rate on HDPE crystallization behavior and composite mechanical properties were investigated. Fiber length and aspect ratio distributions for all fibers followed a lognormal distribution after milling with two parameters defining the curve location (i.e., mean fiber length/aspect ratio) and shape (i.e., mean fiber length/aspect ratio distribution). For both VHDPE and RHDPE, rice straw fiber systems had comparable mechanical properties with those of wood composites. Increase in fiber loading led to increased moduli and decreased tensile and impact strength. Composite panels with rice husk had the smallest storage moduli, but their impact strength was comparable or better than that of other straw fibers. Very little difference in mechanical properties existed among leaf, stem, and whole straw fibers. The particular recycled HDPE resin and its composites had significantly better moduli and strength properties compared to the virgin HDPE systems due to additives used during initial processing. X-ray diffraction experiments showed that introducing fiber to HDPE matrix did not change characteristic peak position, but the fiber increased crystalline thickness of HDPE system. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed that VHDPE had significantly larger peak heat flow during cooling run than the RHDPE, indicating higher crystallization rates for VHDPE. The use of fiber in both resin systems led to the reduced peak heat flow rate. The study showed that rice straw fibers can work well with both VHDPE and RHDPE as reinforcing filler. Future work will deal with effect of coupling treatments of the straw fibers in single phase or commingled plastics composite systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Different kinds of woven CFRP laminates are applied for visual effects, which, however, demand a high level of surface quality of the workpiece including the trimmed edges. This study is the first to investigate the correlations between weave induced fiber undulation and delamination when machining CFRP with a woven fabric. In order to analyze the influence of the undulation, several slots were milled into CFRP with a plain weave structure using polycrystalline diamond cutters. The relative position of the trimmed edge to the weave undulation was varied by inclining the milling path slightly relative to the fiber orientation. Surface damage and fiber protrusion from the trimmed edge were determined separately. To identify the fiber undulation angle and thickness of the top matrix layer, tomographic measurements of the laminate were used. Additionally, a theoretical model for maximum fiber protrusion was established. It became apparent that the combination of fiber undulation angle and thickness of the top matrix layer are responsible for different occurrences of delamination. The influence of tool geometry on delamination is less significant.",

CVM is a structural health monitoring technique for the non-destructive detection of cracks in engineering materials. The paper examines the effect of CVM galleries on the mode I delamination toughness, interlaminar shear strength, and impact damage resistance of a carbon/epoxy laminate. It was found that the galleries improve the mode I delamination toughness by blunting and/or deflecting the crack tip; with the maximum improvement being double the toughness of the laminate free of galleries. The toughness increased with the diameter of the gallery up to a critical size, above which no further improvement was achieved. However, the composite is more prone to unstable delamination cracking in the presence of the galleries. The apparent interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) decreased at a linear rate with an increase in the diameter and volume fraction of galleries. The loss in ILSS is due to the reduction in the effective interlaminar load-bearing area caused by the galleries. Low-energy impact testing revealed that the galleries do not affect the impact damage resistance when below a critical diameter; however, above a threshold gallery size the impact resistance is degraded. This study shows that the incorporation of CVM galleries into laminates can have the added benefit of increased mode I delamination toughness, although the ILSS is degraded and the impact resistance is reduced by large galleries. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The constitutive equation for the composite results from the combination of the constitutive equations of the laminae that, in turn, are obtained from the combination of fibers and matrix. The behavior of each component is simulated by a general elastoplastic anisotropic model. The combination rules obey to the microstructure of the composite. In order to calibrate the general model, the behavior of composites formed by laminae reinforced with unidirectional fibers is studied. Three-dimensional finite element models are used to study the distribution of stresses and strains inside the composite. These finite element models are useful to verify the hypotheses of the proposed composites theory, in a relatively simple way. Comparisons between elastic properties of laminae obtained with the finite elements model, with Mori-Tanaka method, with the model for composite studied and experimental results are included in the paper. Elastic properties of laminates with different stacking sequences and fibers orientations are also obtained. Additionally, application examples showing the non-linear response of laminae and laminates obtained with the calibrated model and comparisons with experimental results are presented. The results show that the calibrated model describes the behavior up to failure of composite laminates. The failure mode of the composite produced by the failure of one or more of its components can be identified. The calibrated model is also able to reproduce complex failure modes that change from the matrix to the fibers depending on the type of stress state. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This paper presents the first investigation into the use of ultrasonic welding to activate a mendable polymer, poly[ethylene-co-(methacrylic acid)] (EMAA), for healing a carbon-epoxy laminate. Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness tests were carried out on specimens containing two different concentration levels of interlaced EMAA fibres to quantify the healing efficiency of ultrasonic vibration. Experimental results reveal that bursts of short-duration, high frequency ultrasonic pulses are able to thermally activate the mendable polymer to repair delamination cracks. Examinations of the fracture surface indicate partial healing of delamination cracks, which were sufficient to completely recover delamination toughness (repair efficiency up to 130%). Furthermore, multiple repairs and recoveries of interlaminar fracture toughness of the composite were achieved with ultrasonic welding. The repair efficiency using ultrasonic welding, however, was found to be less than conventional heating by thermal oven. Nevertheless, the ultrasonic welding technique is portable and can be used for rapid in-field repair of composite structures containing mendable polymers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The use of advanced composite materials for rehabilitation of deteriorating infrastructure has been embraced worldwide. The conventional techniques for strengthening of substandard bridges are costly, time consuming, and labor intensive. Many new techniques have used the lightweight, high strength, and the corrosion resistance of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) laminates for repair and retrofit applications. The load-carrying capacity of a steel-concrete composite girder can be improved significantly by epoxy bonding carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) laminates to its tension flange. This paper presents the results of a study on the behavior of steel-concrete composite girders strengthened with CFRP sheets under static loading. A total of three large-scale composite girders made of W355 X 13.6 A36 steel beam and 75-mm thick by 910-mm wide concrete slab were prepared and tested. The thickness of the CFRP sheet was constant and a different number of layers of 1, 3, and 5 were used in the specimens. The test results, showed that epoxy-bonded CFRP sheet increased the ultimate load-carrying capacity of steel-concrete composite girders and the behavior can be conservatively predicted by traditional methods.",

Aerospace grade plain and satin weave carbon fabrics were used to manufacture the laminate using a toughened SC-15 epoxy resin system with an affordable vacuum assisted resin infusion molding process. For fabrication of stitched laminates, a 3-cord Kevlar thread was used to stitch the fabric preform in lock stitch fashion in an orthogonal grid of size 12.7 and 25.4 mm with 6 mm stitch spacing. Unstitched laminates used in the study were made of 7, 17 and 37 layers whereas the stitched laminates were made of 7 and 17 layers. Four laminates of each type were subjected to high velocity impact loading at different velocity to determine the ballistic limit. The ensuing damage was characterized through ultrasonic NDE. Results of the study indicate that the damage was well contained within the stitch grid incase of stitched laminates. However, ballistic limit was higher for the unstitched laminates. Ballistic limit increased with the increase in the thickness of the laminate. Further, satin weave laminates exhibited higher ballistic limits in most of the cases. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Finite element modeling of drilling of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites is an interesting tool for damage prediction. Recently, complete modeling of the process including the rotatory movement of the drill, penetration in the composite plate and element erosion has been developed in the scientific literature. Computational cost of these complex models is a great disadvantage when comparing them with simplified models that consider the drill acting like a punch that pierces the laminate. In this paper both complete and simplified models were developed and compared in terms of delamination prediction. The simplified model, presenting reduced computational cost, slightly overestimates the delamination factor when compared with the complex model. The influence on delamination of thrust force, clamping area at the bottom surface of the laminate and the stacking sequence is studied using the simplified model. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

A correlation between stiffness reduction and the development of the various types of damage, such as transverse and longitudinal intraply cracking or delamination growth, has been made by various authors. However, the in-situ monitoring of fibre fracture occurring during static or fatigue loading in cfrp laminates has not yet been made except by indirect methods. The measurement of the variation of the electrical resistivity during loading promises to be a valuable technique for this purpose. In the case of a conventional metal sample, the conductivity is essentially the same for any direction of current flow through the sample. In cfrp samples, however, the conductivity is not isotropic and depends on the orientation and on the conductivity of the carbon fibres. Changes in the conductivity can therefore be related to fibre fracture. The resistivity also varies with temperature, and it is therefore necessary to correlate resistivity changes with the temperature changes observed during a fatigue test. The resistivity of cfrp laminates is further dependent on the applied load, the fibre volume fraction, the laminate stacking sequence and the fibre type. Knowing all of these factors, it is possible to correlate the change in the electrical resistivity with damage and failure of the load-bearing 0?? fibres. However, the technique can also be used to monitor continuously the actual load situation in a composite component. ?? 1989.",

This CNT-enhanced NWCT layer was found to significantly improve the Modes I and II interlaminar fracture toughness of a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminate, as measured by double-cantilever-beam (DCB) and end-notched-flexure (ENF) tests. G IC and G IIC of the CNT-enhanced NWCT specimens were compared with baseline CFRP specimens having no interleave, and also specimens having NWCT interleave with no CNT. The mean G IC of the CNT-enhanced NWCT specimens was measured to be 353% higher than the CFRP specimens, a great improvement over the NWCT specimens which showed a 5% reduction relative to CFRP. The mean G IIC of the CNT-enhanced NWCT specimens was 246% higher than the CFRP specimens, which is a significant improvement over the 194% increase measured for the NWCT specimens. Increased G IIC was mainly achieved via crack bridging provided by the NWCT carbon fiber morphology. Additional improvement in G IIC, and the increase in G IC (rather than decrease) of the CNT-enhanced NWCT specimens was due to local CNT reinforcement of the resin near the NWCT fiber surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy shows evidence of improved resin-to-NWCT interface adhesion, short fiber breakage, and CNT pullout at the fracture surfaces. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

In general, environmental degradation is observed as matrix cracking and erosion that leads to deterioration of matrix-dominated properties. In this work, cross-ply laminates of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy were subjected to environmental degradation using controlled ultraviolet radiation (UV) and moisture condensation and the post-exposure mechanical properties were evaluated through elastic modulus and failure strength measurements. Additionally, both degraded and undegraded were subjected to cyclic fatigue loading to investigate possible synergistic effects between environmental degradation and mechanical fatigue. Experimental results show that the degradation results in reduced failure strength. Greater effects of degradation are observed when the materials are tested under flexural as opposed to uniaxial loading. Based on strength measurements and scanning electron microscopy, we identified various damage modes resulting from exposure to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and cyclic loading. The principal mechanisms that lead to reduction in mechanical properties are the loss of fiber confinement due to matrix erosion, due to UV radiation and moisture condensation, and weakened/ cracked ply interfaces due to mechanical fatigue. An empirical relationship was established to quantify the specific influence of different damage mechanisms and to clarify the effects of various degradation conditions.",

Specimens are tested with different insert lengths to various load levels and examined fractographically. Near-tip matrix cracks are found to initiate and propagate intralaminarly before the onset of planar growth. These cracks are inclined at approximately 45?? to the delamination plane and are perpendicular to the direction of maximum near-tip tensile stress. It is found that this represents an intrinsically coupled sequence of events for anti-plane shear loading of continuous fiber laminated polymeric composites when a preexisting delamination is bounded by plies that have their fiber direction aligned with the direction of macroscopic advance. This sequence of events violates the assumptions used in the reduction of data from common mode III tests. It therefore invalidates the associated toughness measurements, and may account for or strongly contribute to the common observation that laminated polymeric composites exhibit an apparent mode III delamination toughness that is dependent on test geometry. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The dynamic behavior of composite laminates is very complex because there are many concurrent phenomena during composite laminate failure under impact load. Fiber breakage, delaminations, matrix cracking, plastic deformations due to contact and large displacements are some effects which should be considered when a structure made from composite material is impacted by a foreign object. Thus, an investigation of the low velocity impact on laminated composite thin disks of epoxy resin reinforced by carbon fiber is presented. The influence of stacking sequence and energy impact was investigated using load-time histories, displacement-time histories and energy-time histories as well as images from NDE. Indentation tests results were compared to dynamic results, verifying the inertia effects when thin composite laminate was impacted by foreign object with low velocity. Finite element analysis (FEA) was developed, using Hill&#039;s model and material models implemented by UMAT (User Material Subroutine) into software ABAQUS™, in order to simulate the failure mechanisms under indentation tests. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The interaction of multiple delaminations in a laminated composite plate loaded dynamically under plane strain conditions (cylindrical bending) is studied by a simple but accurate model that represents the delaminated plate as a set of Timoshenko beams joined by cohesive interfaces. Behavioral maps are derived, which distinguish conditions under which multiple delaminations tend to propagate with equal lengths from those under which one of them tends to grow as a dominant crack with relatively high velocity. In homogeneous systems, equal length growth is favored when the delaminations are equally spaced through the thickness. While the behavioral maps are similar to those for static loading conditions, significant dynamic effects arise in the details of propagation: the maximum energy release rate depends strongly on the loading rate, duration and profile; dynamic effects and crack-interaction effects are generally coupled; and strong hammering effects (chaotic collisions of sub-laminates) can occur during the free wave motions that arise after the load is removed. The hammering effect can be suppressed by imposing a large-scale bridging mechanism (bridging extending far in the crack wake, as from pins or stitches), whereupon energy release rates tend to show smooth oscillations associated with waves propagating on the scale of the whole specimen. The energy absorbed during failure will depend significantly on whether conditions favor multiple delaminations propagating with equal lengths or a single delamination growing dominantly. © 2009.",

Experimental investigations and numerical modeling were performed to determine the effects of using MWCNTs in CFRP laminates. The CFRP specimens were produced using an epoxy nanocomposite matrix reinforced with carboxyl functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH–MWCNTs). Four MWCNTs contents of 0.0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% per weight of the epoxy resin/hardener mixture were examined. Double cantilever beam (DCB) tests were performed to determine the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the unidirectional CFRP composites. This composite material property was quantified using the critical energy release rate, GIC. The experimental results show a 25%, 20%, and 17% increase in the maximum interlaminar fracture toughness of the CFRP composites with the addition of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt% MWCNTs, respectively. Microstructural investigations using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) verify that chemical reactions took place between the COOH–MWCNTs and the epoxy resin, supporting the improvements experimentally observed in the interlaminar fracture toughness of the CFRP specimens containing MWCNTs. Finite element (FE) simulations show good agreement with the experimental results and confirm the significant effect of MWCNTs on the interlaminar fracture toughness of CFRP.",

If many Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods have already been developed to test such structures, detecting defects in polymer matrix laminates remains difficult. After a short overview of the main existing NDT methods, this paper focuses on two techniques which appear to be very promising: thermosonics and infra-red (IR) thermography. For thermosonics tests, an ultrasonic horn mechanically loads the sample, while an IR camera records the defect heating. For thermography tests, the heating is due to an optical wave. If minor improvements on the test device are presented for thermosonics tests, IR thermography tests are achieved with a CO 
                        2 laser as excitation source, which is a very innovative approach. This paper provides many experimental results obtained from an aeronautical carbon-epoxy plate with a central delamination.

Finally, some improvements to further optimize the thermography tests are proposed in conclusion. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The peak frequency distribution as a function of displacement represented characteristic changes of the fracture process in various SEN-GFML specimens.

The effective elastic constants of the damaged zone of the laminates were evaluated according to Sun&#039;s explicit expression. Finally, the dent depth vs. indentation force curve was predicted based on Turner&#039;s contact theory. The numerical results indicate that the dent initiation is induced by the matrix cracking and delamination, and the transition to rapid increase in dent depth is due to the fiber breakages. The numerical results agree well with the test data for the delamination onset load, the maximum contact force and the corresponding dent depth.",

The near-threshold growth of delamination fatigue cracks was investigated with seven kinds of unidirectional laminates made from brittle epoxy matrix, toughened epoxy matrix and thermoplastic PEEK matrix. Tests were carried out under mode I loading at different stress ratios. The fatigue crack growth behavior of laminates tested here was mainly controlled by the toughness of the matrix resin. The crack growth rate under different stress ratios was a unique function of the equivalent stress intensity range proposed by the authors. The parameter, ??, to indicate the relative contribution of the maximum stress to the cyclic stress was determined from the analysis of the stress-ratio dependency. For the toughened matrix system, the crack growth rate was mainly controlled by the stress range; the ?? value was small. On the other hand, for the case of brittle epoxy, the contribution of the maximum stress was large; the ?? value was large. The resistance against fatigue crack growth increased with the increase of the static fracture toughness. However, the ratio of the fatigue threshold to the static fracture toughness decreased with the decrease of the ?? value. Thus, the increase of the fracture toughness does not fully contribute to the fatigue crack growth resistance. The difference in growth behavior due to matrix resin and fibers was discussed on the bases of mechanism consideration and fractographic observation. ?? 1994.",

Thus, the complex process and state of delamination damage can be simulated practically with high efficiency for both analysis and modeling.

The proposed delamination criterion with a nonlinear friction function considers the full extent of the ILS increase observed in available experiments.

The problem is resolved at a &quot;meso-level&quot;, where separate plies are explicitly modelled and connected via interfaces to form a laminate. A recently proposed formulation of the interface, cf. [Int. J. Numer. Methods Engrg. 54 (2002) 473], based on the regularized strong discontinuity concept, is used to model delamination considered as a damage process accompanied by regularized displacement discontinuity development. As to kinematics, since structural composites often can be considered as shells, shell kinematics is adopted for both the continuous and the discontinuous parts of the deformation. The discontinuous mid-surface and director are considered as independent fields from the corresponding continuous ones, whereby incompatible discontinuous modes within the finite element can be avoided. As compared to the other formulations in the literature, where a structural coupling of the layers of plies are normally emphasized, the present shell formulation focus on the consistent incorporation of a discontinuum with a regularized strong discontinuity in the context of shell kinematics.

The fracture energy is deduced from the data according to the area and the compliance methods. The morphology was explained through thermal analysis using DMA and fractography from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed improvement in high temperature moulding compound (HIM) system with 180°C cure in terms of interlaminar fracture toughness. There is also an improvement in MTM and LTM systems. SEM micrographs revealed their excellent delamination resistance as good crack stoppers with the evidence of strong fibre/matrix interface. For MTM systems G&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt; values dropped after post curing. This reduction was significant for MTM49-3 but not so much in the case of MTM49-7 laminate.

In the present study, instrumented impact tests were used to characterize such effects for carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic toughened epoxy laminates. Impact resistance was characterized in terms of load and energy parameters measured during penetration tests. These parameters were related to damage in the lami nates by conducting rebound tests followed by ultrasonic imaging and microscopy. The results clearly demonstrated a relationship between the onset of damage and the first peak in the load versus deflection plots obtained in the penetration tests. No major effects of stacking sequence or reinforcement form were apparent in terms of the energy required for the onset of damage in the laminates. Energy to maximum load was found to be highly de pendent on stacking sequence. Substitution of woven reinforcement for unidirectional tape in a quasi-isotropic layup resulted in a substantial decrease in the energy to maximum load. The results in terms of peak load showed similar trends. No effects of stacking se quence or reinforcement form were observed in terms of energy after peak load. It is ap parent from this work that stacking sequence and reinforcement form can have significant effects on impact resistance particularly at higher impact energies.",

The numerical approach presented is based on the framework of a cohesive zone model. A traction-separation law is presented which accounts for breakdown of the micromechanisms responsible for load transfer across bridged delamination cracks. The load transfer behavior is coupled to heat conduction across the bridged delamination crack. The coupled crack-bridging model is implemented into a finite element framework as a thermomechanical cohesive zone model (CZM). The fundamental response of the thermomechanical CZM is described. Subsequently, bridged delamination cracks of fixed lengths are studied. Values of the crack tip energy release rate and of the crack heat flux are computed to characterize the loading of the structure. Specimen geometries are considered that lead to crack opening through bending deformation and buckling delamination. The influence of critical mechanical and thermal parameters of the bridging zone on the thermomechanical delamination behavior is discussed. Bridging fibers not only contribute to crack conductance, but by keeping the crack opening small they allow heat flux across the delamination crack to be sustained longer, and thereby contribute to reduced levels of thermal stresses. The micro-mechanism based cohesive zone model allows the assessment of the effectiveness of the individual mechanisms contributing to the thermomechanical crack bridging embedded into the structural analysis. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The measured quasi-static shear strength varied between 0.8 and 7.5 MPa. Two failure modes were observed: (i) Euler buckling of the struts and (ii) delamination failure of the laminates. Micro-buckling failure of the struts was not observed in the experiments reported here while Euler buckling and delamination failures occurred for the low (???????1%) and high (????&gt;1%) relative density cores, respectively. Analytical models for the collapse of the composite cores by these failure modes are presented. Good agreement between the measurements and predictions based on the Euler buckling and delamination failure of the struts is observed while the micro-buckling analysis over-predicts the measurements.

Several parameters can affect the fatigue delamination growth in laminates - that includes e.g. constituent material properties and/or composite shape. Knowledge about effects of those parameters can lead to a better understanding of the fatigue delamination behavior and can also pinpoint directions for optimum composite design. Those effects can be elucidated by undertaking appropriate sensitivity analysis. Hence, a probabilistic approach to sensitivity analysis is proposed in this work to study the effects of composite parameters in a fatigue delamination problem of a two-layer composite. This approach combines together a fatigue delamination model, Monte Carlo simulations and the finite element method (FEM). As a result, probabilistic sensitivities are obtained in the form of correlation coefficients and also as trend-line gradients. Accuracy and efficacy of the approach is evaluated based on two numerical examples. The current approach is found to be insensitive to the parameter standard deviation and number of sampling points. Moreover, the current approach can be used irrespectively from the type of the boundary value problem (linear or non-linear) provided that the problem is solvable by the numerical method such as the FEM. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This paper describes the response of CFRP laminates of different thicknesses to a shock load normal to the fibres direction. The effects of the shock duration on the wave propagation are key issues of this work. Experiments have been performed on high power laser facilities and on a high power pulsed generator to get a wide range of pulse duration from fs to µs.

The influence of the IF-WS 2 on the morphology, thermal, mechanical and tribological properties of PPS/CF composites was investigated. Efficient nanoparticle dispersion within the matrix was attained without using surfactants. A progressive rise in thermal stability was found with increasing IF-WS 2 loading, as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis. The addition of low nanoparticle contents retarded the crystallization of the matrix, whereas concentrations equal or higher than 1.0 wt% increased both the crystallization temperature and degree of crystallinity compared to those of PPS/CF. Mechanical tests indicated that with only 1.0 wt% IF-WS 2 the flexural modulus and strength of PPS/CF improved by 17 and 14%, respectively, without loss in toughness, ascribed to a synergistic effect between the two fillers. A significant enhancement in the storage modulus and glass transition temperature was also observed. Moreover, the wear rate and coefficient of friction strongly decreased, attributed to the lubricant role of the IF-WS 2 combined with their reinforcing effect. These inorganic nanoparticles show great potential to improve the mechanical and tribological properties of conventional thermoplastic/CF composites for structural applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, some thin composite plates were fabricated and sub jected to low-velocity impact. The delamination in every specimen was examined. Experi mental results revealed that the delamination area was proportional to the lamina thickness and the difference of fiber angle between adjacent laminae. A Mismatch Theory based on the difference of bending stiffness between adjacent laminae was used to interpret the cause of high interlaminar stress level. The effect of interlaminar strengths on the delami nation resistance was also discussed.

The ultrathin self-healing fibers were fabricated by means of coelectrospinning, in which liquid dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) as the healing agent was enwrapped into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to form core-shell DCPD/PAN nanofibers. These core-shell nanofibers were incorporated at interfaces of neighboring carbon-fiber fabrics prior to resin infusion and formed into ultrathin self-healing interlayers after resin infusion and curing. The core-shell DCPD/PAN fibers are expected to function to self-repair the interfacial damages in composite laminates, e.g., delamination. Wet layup, followed by vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) technique, was used to process the proof-of-concept hybrid multiscale self-healing composite. Three-point bending test was utilized to evaluate the self-healing effect of the core-shell nanofibers on the flexural stiffness of the composite laminate after predamage failure. Experimental results indicate that the flexural stiffness of such novel self-healing composite after predamage failure can be completely recovered by the self-healing nanofiber interlayers. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized for fractographical analysis of the failed samples. SEM micrographs clearly evidenced the release of healing agent at laminate interfaces and the toughening and self-healing mechanisms of the core-shell nanofibers.

          "abstract": "Fibre Metal Laminates (FML) consist of bonded alternating thin aluminium and fibre/epoxy layers. Post-stretching of FML after curing is accompanied by plastic deformation which causes a reversal of the internal stresses due to curing which is favourable for their fatigue properties. The influence of this post-stretching on the delamination resistance was studied. The G(Ic) FML with aramid fibre (ARALL) was increased by post-stretching, No influence was found on the G(Ic) of glass fibre based FML (GLARE). The G(IIc) of FML was hardly influenced. The mode I and II delamination resistance of GLARE is significantly higher than that of ARALL. There appeared to be no relationship between these G(c)-values and the delamination of realistic structural details: the delamination of doublers as applied in aircraft wing panels. Post-stretching increased the delamination resistance of doubler specimens and despite its higher G(c)-values GLARE doubler specimens showed the same delamination resistance as ARALL. Although the delamination resistance of post-stretched doubler specimens was increased, the delamination progression after exceeding the delamination stress was for post-stretched material much faster than for as cured material, due to the larger amount of strain energy stored in the laminates during the post-stretching operation. Delamination fatigue tests indicated two competing mechanisms on the delamination growth rate. Therefore the delamination fatigue behavior is largely influenced by post-stretching, but the effect can be either positive or negative.",

          "abstract": "The simulation of delamination using the Finite Element Method (FEM) is a useful tool to analyse fracture mechanics. In this paper, simulations are performed by means of two different fracture mechanics models: Two Step Extension (TSEM) and Cohesive Zone (CZM) methods, using implicit and explicit solvers, respectively.

                        c) using the critical energy release rate as input. The two methods were compared in terms of convergence performance and accuracy to represent the material behaviour and in order to investigate their validity to predict mode I interlaminar fracture failure in unidirectional AS4/8552 carbon fibre composite laminates. The influence of increasing the loading speed and using mass scaling was studied in order to decrease computing time in CZ models. Finally, numerical simulations were compared with experimental results performed by means of Double Cantilever Beam specimens (DCB).

Composite materials are widely used as structural materials for aerospace engineering, because of its excellent mechanical properties such as light weight, high stiffness and anti-corrosion characteristics. This paper uses pulsed electronic speckle pattern interferometry (Pulsed-ESPI) to perform non-destructive evaluation of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminate plates containing various sizes of artificial defects located at the centre of the specimen, based on vibration characteristic using double-pulsed Ruby laser with a pulse duration of 30 ns. The pulsed separation can be adjusted in between 2 and 800 μs. The main advantage of this technique over conventional ESPI is the ability to carry out measurements even under harsh environmental conditions. From the results, it seems to be effective for the detection of defects in various kinds of composite materials.

In many of these practical situations, the structures are prone to high impact loads. Material and structural response vary significantly under impact loading conditions as compared to quasi-static loading. The strain rate sensitivity of both carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) are studied by testing a single laminate configuration, viz. cross-ply [0°/90°] polymer matrix composites (PMC) at strain rates of 10−3 and 450 s−1. The compressive material properties are determined by testing both laminate systems, viz. CFRP and GFRP at low to high strain rates. The laminates were fabricated from 48 layers of cross-ply carbon fibre and glass fibre epoxy. Dynamic test results were compared with static compression test carried out on specimens with the same dimensions. Preliminary compressive stress–strain vs. strain rates data obtained show that the dynamic material strength for GFRP increases with increasing strain rates. The strain to failure for both CFRP and GFRP is seen to decrease with increasing strain rate.",

A modified Double Crack Lap Shear (DCLS) specimen was chosen for this study. An expression relating the delamination size and the compliance of a DCLS specimen was derived, and a test method for the delamination growth rate in DCLS specimens developed. The delamination sizes and the delamination growth rates of DCLS specimens were determined by monitoring the compliances of specimens during fatigue. Delamination growth rates at different stress ratios (R= 0.1, 0.3,0.5) were measured. A Walker-type equation for the delamination growth rate was obtained by a multiple linear regression analysis. It was shown that the compliance method for determining the delamination growth rate of DCLS specimens is not only convenient and practical, but also accurate. The delamination size in DCLS specimens increases linearly with cycles during fatigue, i.e. delamination growth rate is constant, independent of delamination size. The energy release rate was adopted to characterize delamination growth behaviour. Good agreement between the Walker equation and test results of the delamination growth rate was found.",

In the finite element model developed, a through-width delamination is introduced close to one surface of a flat panel, and a void is placed in the delamination plane ahead of each delamination front. The panel is subjected to compression in the fiber direction. The postbuckling delamination growth is studied by calculating the strain energy release rate (SERR) using the virtual crack closure technique. Local stress analyses of the region near the delamination front are also performed to further investigate the void effects. It is found that although the presence of void does not significantly alter the postbuckling transverse displacement of the delaminated panel, the induced stress perturbation by the void affects the SERR. The Mode II SERR as well as the total SERR increase depending on the size of the void and its distance from the delamination front. Since the Mode I SERR shows non-monotonic behavior with the applied load, the effects of voids are studied on its maximum value. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Strength is predicted by applying a failure criterion based on the tensile stress distribution in the 0-degrees plies, as modified by damage (either quasi-static or fatigue). The volume dependence of strength is included by using a simple Weibull distribution. The parameters of the model are determined from independent experiments. Good agreement with experimental results is obtained. Comparisons are made with previous results from carbon fibre/epoxy laminates.

Delaminations are modeled using a cohesive type tie-break interface introduced between sublaminates while intralaminar damage mechanisms within the sublaminates are captured in a smeared manner using a strain-softening plastic-damage model. In the latter case, a nonlocal regularization scheme is used to address the spurious mesh dependency and mesh-orientation problems that occur with all local strain-softening type constitutive models. The results for the predicted damage patterns using the nonlocal approach are encouraging and qualitatively agree with the experimental observations. The predictive performance of the proposed numerical model is assessed through comparisons with available instrumented impact test results on a class of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite laminates. Force-time histories and other derived cross-plots such as the force versus projectile displacement and progression of projectile energy loss as a function of time are compared with available experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the model in capturing the details of the dynamic response. Another case study involving the blast loading of CFRP composite laminates is used to further highlight the capability of the proposed model in simulating the global structural response of composite laminates subjected to distributed pressure pulses. 2009 by ASME.",

The effect of improved matrix toughness on the Mode II properties was determined by testing four different graphite fiber composite systems having widely different Mode I fracture energies. The results indicated that the benefits of improved matrix toughness on the composite properties were less under Mode II loading than under Mode I and were reduced further still, or eliminated entirely, under Mode II fatigue conditions.

          "abstract": "Analytical solutions to predict the ballistic limit and energy absorption of fully clamped GLARE panels subjected to ballistic impact by a blunt cylinder were derived. The analytical solutions were based on test results from NASA Glenn. The ballistic limit was found through an iterative process such that the initial kinetic energy of the projectile would equal the total energy dissipated by panel deformation, delamination/debonding and fracture. The transient deformation of the panel as shear waves propagate from the point of impact was obtained from an equivalent mass-spring system, whereby the inertia and stiffness depend on the shear wave speed and time. Predictions of the ballistic limit from the resulting non-linear differential equation were within 13% of the test data. The deformation energy due to bending and membrane accounted for most of the total energy absorbed (84-92%), with the thinner panels absorbing a higher percentage of deformation energy than the thicker panels. Energy dissipated in delamination represented 2-9% of the total absorbed energy, with the thinner panels absorbing a lower percentage of delamination energy than the thicker panels. About 7% of the total energy was attributed to tensile fracture energy of the glass/epoxy and aluminum. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "This chapter presents failure envelopes for unidirectional composites and multilayered composite laminates, which have been predicted by linear laminate theory. There are three major failure modes in composites-namely, fiber failure, matrix failure, and fiber/matrix interfacial failure. Because, in general, the stresses in the fiber and matrix are different; their respective failures are determined by different stresses and have different failure mechanisms. Thus, a lamina failure criterion that separates matrix failure from fiber failure, such as the Hashin-Rotem criterion, is mechanistically more appropriate. The ply-by-ply discount method with parallel spring stiffness reduction model is used in the prediction. Laminate ply-by-ply failure analysis is performed on the basis of the 2-D stress field in the laminate. The stress/strain behavior of four laminates under uniaxial or biaxial loading is predicted by considering both material nonlinearity and progressive matrix cracking. Material nonlinearity is considered by using a one-parameter plasticity model for fiber reinforced composites. Progressive matrix cracking and the corresponding stiffness reduction are predicted by the use of a simplified shear-lag analysis and finite element analysis.",

The stress distribution around the pin-loaded hole was verified with the widely used cosine stress distribution model.

It is essential to simulate the initial and subsequent evolution process of this kind of damage phenomenon accurately in order to explore the mechanical properties of composite laminates. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the general methodologies on the damage constitutive modeling by continuum damage mechanics (CDM), the various failure criteria, the damage evolution law simulating the stiffness degradation, and the finite element implementation of progressive failure analysis in terms of the mechanical response for the variable-stiffness composite laminates arising from the continuous failure. The damage constitutive modeling is discussed by describing the evolvement of damage tensors and conjugate forces in the CDM theory. The failure criteria which interpret the failure modes and their interaction are compared and some advanced methods such as the cohesive theory which are used to predict the damage evolution properties of composites are also discussed. In addition, the solution algorithm using finite element analysis which implements progressive failure analysis is summarized and several applicable methods which deal with the numerical convergence problem due to singular finite element stiffness matrices are also compared in order to explore the whole failure process and ultimate load-bearing ability of composite laminates. Finally, the multiscale progressive failure analysis as a popular topic which associates the macroscopic with microscopic damage and failure mechanisms is discussed and the extended finite element method as a new finite element technique is expected to accelerate its practical application to the progressive failure analysis of composite laminates.",

To this aim, instrumented impact tests were carried out on glass fabric/epoxy laminates of three different thicknesses, using different energy levels. The irreversibly absorbed energy was obtained from the force-displacement curves provided by the impact machine. To assess damage progression as a function of impact energy, ply-by-ply delamination and fibre breakages revealed by destructive tests were measured. A previous model, based on energy balance considerations, was applied to interpret the experimental results, together with an original method of data reduction, allowing for the isolation of the maximum energy portion due to indentation and vibrational effects. From the results obtained, the contribution of fibre breakage and matrix damage to the irreversibly absorbed energy is comparable at low impact energies; with increasing initial energy levels, delamination becomes predominant in determining energy dissipation. However, the critical energy-release rate required to propagate delamination, as calculated from impact data, is considerably higher than the typical values deriving from Mode II delamination tests performed under laboratory conditions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

However, they are regarded as difficult-to-cut materials because of bad surface quality and low productivity. Drilling is the most common hole making process for CFRP composite laminates and drilling induced delamination damage usually occurs severely at the exit side of drilling holes, which strongly deteriorate holes quality. In this work, the candle stick drill and multi-facet drill are employed to evaluate the machinability of drilling T700/LT-03A CFRP composite laminates in terms of thrust force, delamination, holes diameter and holes surface roughness. S/N ratio is used to characterize the thrust force while an ellipse-shaped delamination model is established to quantitatively analyze the delamination. The best combination of drilling parameters are determined by full consideration of S/N ratios of thrust force and the delamination. The results indicate that candle stick drill will induce the unexpected ellipse-shaped delamination even at its best drilling parameters of spindle speed of 10,000 rpm and feed rate of 0.004 mm/tooth. However, the multi-facet drill cutting at the relative lower feed rate of 0.004 mm/tooth and lower spindle speed of 6000 rpm can effectively prevent the delamination. Comprehensively, holes quality obtained by multi-facet drill is much more superior to those obtained by candle stick drill.",

It is found that G(I) increases with crack growth (or delamination) in both materials, but the maximum toughness of the PVAL coated composite is larger. In the experiments crack bridging due to fibre misalignment along the delaminated interface has been observed in both composites and, as a consequence, the measured compliance is smaller than that of an unbridged crack of the same length.   Since the delamination toughness, G(I), is normally evaluated by the compliance technique, it is necessary to determine the influence of fibre bridging on compliance. A recent crack bridging theory which considers the difference in experimental and theoretical compliances has been used in the present work to determine the fibre bridging stresses. It is shown that the crack growth resistance (R) curve obtained for the delamination process is consistent with the observation of fibre bridging in the delaminated region.

The\nconsequences of impact loading in composite panels are matrix cracking,\ninter laminar failure and, eventually, fiber breakage for higher impact\nenergies. Even when no visible impact damage is observed on the surface\nat the point of impact, matrix cracking and inter laminar failure can\noccur, and the carrying load of the composite laminates is considerably\nreduced.

For this purpose a\nseries of impact and compression after impact tests were carried out on\ncomposite laminates made of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resin matrix.\nFour stacking sequences representative of four different elastic\nbehaviours were used.

          "abstract": "The effect of strain rate on the compressive and shear behavior of carbon/epoxy composite materials was investigated. Strain rate behavior of composites with fiber waviness was also studied. Falling weight impact system and servohydraulic testing machine were used for dynamic characterisation of composite materials in compression at strain rates up to several hundred per second. Strain rates below 10 s-1 were generated using a hydraulic testing machine. Strain rates above 10 s-1 were generated using the drop tower apparatus developed. Seventy-two-ply unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminates (IM6G/3501-6) loaded in the longitudinal and transverse directions and (08/908)2/08s crossply laminates were characterised. Off-axis (30 and 45) compression tests of the same unidirectional material were also conducted to obtain the in-plane shear stress-strain behavior. The 90 properties, which are governed by the matrix, show an increase in modulus and strength over the static values but no significant change in ultimate strain. The shear stress-strain behavior, which is also matrix-dominated, shows high nonlinearity with a plateau region at a stress level that increases significantly with increasing strain rate. The 0 and crossply laminates show higher strength and strain values as the strain rate increases, whereas the modulus increases only slightly over the static value. The increase in strength and ultimate strain observed may be related to the shear behavior of the composite and the change in failure modes. In all cases the dynamic stress-strain curves stiffen as the strain rate increases. The stiffening is lowest in the longitudinal case and highest in the transverse and shear cases. Unidirectional and crossply specimens with fiber waviness were fabricated and tested. It is shown that, with severe fiber waviness, strong nonlinearity occurs in the stress-strain curves due to fiber waviness with significant stiffening as the strain rate increases. 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The test variables included different degrees of strengthening scheme and two types of sustained load for both un-cracked and cracked beams. For flexural strengthening, the increase of ultimate strength provided by CFRP was assessed by varying the layers of laminates and incorporating end anchorage. In time-dependent test, deflection reduction coefficient in concrete tension stiffening model is proposed to evaluate the stiffness of the section after cracking for RC beams.

In particular, interlaminar shear fatigue properties of glass/epoxy and carbon/epoxy composite tape material systems used in aircraft fatigue-critical applications are needed. The interlaminar shear fatigue material properties, essential for the development of the analysis methods able to capture fatigue delamination failure onset in composite structures, are presented in this work. S-N curves are generated based on custom short-beam shear (SBS) fatigue tests. The custom SBS test configurations ensure a consistent interlaminar shear failure mode. This work extends the recently developed methodology, published in Composites Science and Technology to characterize nonlinear shear properties of composite materials using digital image correlation (DIC) and finite element analysis, to fatigue loading. Test data sets used to develop the fatigue properties, include approximately 20 glass/epoxy and 30 carbon/epoxy SBS coupons. All tests were run in load control at 0.1 load ratio. To better understand material behavior under cyclic loading, surface shear strain was monitored using the DIC technique. Accurate shear stress approximation resulted in similar S-N curve shapes for the glass-fiber and the carbon-fiber composites. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

After testing, many samples were sectioned in order to highlight the failure modes under low-velocity impact loading. The FMLs absorbed significant energy in plastic deformation, tearing the metal layers and fiber fracture, and offered a superior impact resistance to the plain composite on which the FMLs were based. The perforation data were normalized by the areal density of the target and the superiority of the metal—composite hybrids remained in evidence. Increasing the target size, the plate thickness, and the indentor diameter resulted in an increase in the energy required to perforate the target. In contrast, impacting the square panels at the corner or along the edge of the target did not have a significant effect on the perforation response of the structures.",

Scanning electron microscopy images showed enhanced fiber-matrix interfacial bonding in the specimens with F-SWCNTs.

Translaminar (fibre direction) mode I fracture toughness has recently been experimentally determined to be thickness dependent. This paper presents a computational study of the tensile strength prediction of open-hole laminates using a cohesive zone model. To the authors’ knowledge, it is for the first time in the literature that the thickness-dependence of translaminar fracture toughness is accounted for in the numerical modelling of composites. The thickness size effect in the strength of open-hole composite laminates failed by pull-out is accurately predicted for the first time by a deterministic model. It is found that neglecting delamination in the numerical models will lead to mesh-dependency and over-estimation on the predicted strength. Smeared crack model with cohesive elements to model delamination is able to predict the correct failure mode; but it is found not suitable for accurate strength predictions for laminates failed by delamination.",

Generalized plane strain elements and interface elements have been developed for this purpose. Thermal and hygroscopic effects have been taken into account for the modelling of the plys, and a mode-I fracture model which incorporates strain softening has been used for the interface behaviour. The out-of-plane loading is controlled via an indirect displacement control technique, which permits tracing the entire loading history. Using non-linear finite element analysis free edge delamination in different graphite/epoxy laminates is examined.

Also the effects of laminate thickness (size effect) can be described properly. ?? 1993.",

          "abstract": "Carbon fiber reinforced plastics are mostly used in laminates, which consist of several very thin layers stacked over each other. In this work, these layers are composed of either unidirectional fibers or textile reinforcements embedded in an epoxy resin. To model the orthotropic material behavior of such layers, a meso-mechanically motivated material model is used, which is based on structural tensors which represent the fiber orientations. This fully three-dimensional material model is incorporated into a solid-shell finite element, which is particularly suited for application to thin shell-like structures, because all occurring locking phenomena are cured by implementing both the EAS and the ANS concept in combination with a new concept of reduced integration with hourglass stabilization. The latter leads to high computational efficiency, still representing satisfactorily the through-the-thickness stress distribution, since the number of integration points in thickness direction can be chosen arbitrarily. Furthermore, in the presented cases, delamination is one of the most important failure mechanisms and thus needs to be considered. This is done by combining a cohesive zone-like continuum damage model with the solid-shell element formulation, which covers the interaction of different failure modes.",

The formulation is based on the Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) theory that fails to predict the delamination onset in composite laminates. The lack of resolving three-dimensional states and correct transverse stresses in this model is principally improved using post-processing. In order to precisely compute interlaminar stresses, a non-frictional linear adhesive contact model is applied in the context of the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The discontinuities are imposed within any arbitrary interface by enriching the displacement field. Thus two sub-domains define the plane of the discontinuity. Thereafter, the aforementioned adhesive contact can be formulated at the discontinued interface. Stress values are retrieved at nodal points using the interface constitutive equation. Consequently, the interface formulations are extended into the softening regime to model the delamination growth as a mixed-mode cohesive effect. The accuracy of the proposed method in predicting the interlaminar stresses and the delamination propagation is demonstrated by comparing the results with the ones available in literature. By combining the lower-order plate theory and the novel XFEM technique, the model is able to accurately calculate the delamination onset and the propagation with less computational effort.",

Damage is assumed to initiate when one of Hashin&#039;s failure criteria is satisfied, and its evolution is modeled by an empirical relation proposed by Matzenmiller, Lubliner and Taylor. The transient nonlinear problem is solved by the finite element method (FEM). Contributions of the work include considering damage in 3-D rather than plane stress deformations of a laminated structure and elasto-plastic deformations of the composite. This has been accomplished by developing a user defined subroutine and implementing it in the FE software ABAQUS. From strains supplied by ABAQUS the material subroutine uses a micro-mechanics approach based on the method of cells and values of material parameters of constituents to calculate average stresses in an FE, and checks for Hashin&#039;s failure criteria. If damage has initiated in the material, the subroutine evaluates the damage developed, computes resulting stresses, and provides them to ABAQUS. The damage evolved at a material point is not allowed to decrease during unloading. The delamination failure mode is simulated by using the cohesive zone model available in ABAQUS. The computed time histories of the axial load acting on the impactor are found to agree well with the experimental ones available in the literature, and various damage and failure modes agree qualitatively with those observed in tests. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

As a result, it was found that the growth of the transverse crack and the delamination could be evaluated with the unique Paris law constants, respectively.

Compression failure of composite structures previously damaged by an impact event is due to the propagation of impact-induced damage mechanisms such as interlaminar debonding, constituent (i.e., matrix and fiber) microcracking, sublaminate buckling, as well as the interactions between these mechanisms. The failure mechanisms within each ply are idealized based on a reduced order multiscale computational model, in which, the damage propagation in the matrix and fibers upon compression is explicitly modeled. Delamination along the ply interfaces is idealized using a cohesive surface model. The initial impact-induced damage within the microconstituents and interfaces are inferred from experimental observations. A suite of numerical simulations is conducted to understand the sublaminate buckling, propagation of delamination and constituent damage upon compression loading. The numerical investigations suggest extensive propagation of delamination with mode transition preceding sublaminate buckling. Initiation and propagation of matrix and fiber cracking, observed upon sublaminate buckling, is the cause of ultimate shear failure. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Interface elements with de-cohesive constitutive law in the content of continuum damage mechanics can be used to predict initiation and growth of delamination in single and mixed mode conditions.

The model was programmed as the user element and user material by the &quot;User Programmable Features&quot; in ANSYS finite element software. The interface element is a three-dimensional 20 node brick with small thickness. Because of mixed-mode condition of stress field at the delamination-front of post-buckled laminates, a mixed-mode bilinear constitutive law has been used as user material in this model. The constitutive law of interface element has been verified by modelling of a single element. A composite laminate with initial delamination under quasi-static compressive Loading available from literature has been remodeled with the present approach. Moreover, it will be shown that, the closer the delamination to the free surface of laminate, the slower the delamination growth under compressive fatigue loading.

Double cantilever beam tests at both room temperature and high temperature are conducted to assess the mode I interlaminar fracture toughness. The experimental and characterization efforts suggest that carbon nanotubes improve bonding at the hybrid interface. Simple computational models are developed to assist the interpretation of experimental results and further investigate the damage modes. The numerical results agree well with the limited experiments at crack initiation and furthermore support the absence of mode mixity.",

To simplify complicated thermoelastic description of weak interfaces, two basic hypotheses are made. The discontinuity of interfacial displacements is depicted by the interfacial constitutive relations between the interfacial displacement jumps and the interfacial transverse stresses. The discontinuity of interfacial temperature is depicted by a thin layer of thermal conduction between two weakly bonded layers. An experiential formula which accounts for the relation between the interfacial temperature jump and the interfacial normal opening is presented to determine interfacial temperature jump. These hypotheses result in linear mathematical formulation. As an application, the three-dimensional thermoelastic solutions of cross-ply rectangular laminates with weakly bonded layers are presented and may be used to test the accuracy of approximate lower-dimensional models of thermoelastic delamination in future studies. The effects of interfacial weak bonding on the thermoelastic response of laminates are discussed in numerical examples. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the paper, an accurate study of quasi-static delamination growth under mode II loading condition is conducted. Several experimental tests are performed on composite laminates consisting of unidirectional carbon/epoxy layers. Four-point end-notched flexure (4ENF) test is employed in order to characterize the mode II interlaminar fracture toughness. The R-curve is obtained by means of optical and numerical determination of crack tip position. The energy release rate and the crack length are calculated through experimental determination of the compliance until unstable advance occurs.

Explosive charges of 0.64– 100 kg TNT equivalent were used during these air- and underwater-blast tests. The difference in response and damage inflicted from underwater- and air-blast loading was assessed from strain-field measurements and post-blast specimen analysis. Procedures for monitoring the structural response of such materials during blast events have been devised. High-speed photography was employed during the airblast loading of GFRP and CFRP sandwich panels, in conjunction with digital image correlation (DIC), to monitor the deformation of these structures under shock loading. Failure mechanisms have been revealed using DIC and confirmed in post-test sectioning. The improved performance of composite sandwich structures with CFRP skins compared to GFRP equivalent constructions is demonstrated for air-blast experiments. Strain gauges were used to monitor the structural response of similar sandwich materials and GFRP tubular laminates during underwater shocks. The effect of the supporting/backing medium (air or water) of the target facing the shock has been identified during these studies. Mechanisms of failure have been established such as core crushing, skin/core cracking, delamination and fibre breakage. Strain gauge data supported the mechanisms for such damage. A transition in behaviour was observed in the sandwich panels when subject to an underwater blast as opposed to an air-blast load. Damage mechanisms notably shifted from distributed core shear failure originating from regions of high shear in air blast to global core crushing in underwater blast. The full-scale experimental results presented here will assist in the development of analytical and computational models. Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of boundary conditions with regards to blast resistant design.",

The goal was to combine the accuracy of the full three-dimensional solution with the computational efficiency of a plate or shell finite element model. Multi-point constraints provided a kinematically compatible interface between the local three-dimensional model and the global structural model which has been meshed with plate or shell finite elements. Double cantilever beam (DCB), end notched flexure (ENF), and single leg bending (SLB) specimens were modeled using the shell/3D technique to study the feasibility for pure mode I (DCB), mode II (ENF) and mixed mode I/II (SLB) cases. Mixed mode strain energy release rate distributions were computed across the width of the specimens using the virtual crack closure technique. Specimens with a unidirectional layup and with a multidirectional layup where the delamination is located between two non-zero degree plies were simulated. For a local three-dimensional model, extending to a minimum of about three specimen thicknesses on either side of the delamination front, the results were in good agreement with mixed mode strain energy release rates obtained from computations where the entire specimen had been modeled with solid elements. For large built-up composite structures modeled with plate elements, the shell/3D modeling technique offers a great potential for reducing the model size, since only a relatively small section in the vicinity of the delamination front needs to be modeled with solid elements.",

The potential of this simulation approach for correctly predicting the through-thickness distribution of internal damage was specifically examined in the study. The constitutive models for intralaminar and interlaminar damage modes were incorporated into the ABAQUS/Explicit FE code by user-defined VUMAT material subroutines. The results of numerical simulations were compared with experimental data obtained by drop-weight impact testing and stereoscopic X-radiography. The developed FE model provided a correct prediction of the structural impact response of laminated samples over the range of impact energies examined and successfully simulated the temporal sequence of the major damage mechanisms. A reasonably good agreement was also achieved between numerical predictions and experimental observations in terms of shapes, orientations and sizes of individual delaminations induced by impact at the different interfaces. Additional numerical analyses were also conducted to investigate the influence of simulated intralaminar damage modes on the prediction of interface delaminations. The analyses show that implementation of intralaminar damage modes may be required for accurate simulation of the three dimensional delamination pattern induced by impact. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Effective-time theory has been used to characterize the physical aging behavior of each linear viscoelastic lamina. In accordance with experimental findings, the aging behavior of each lamina is allowed to differ in the shear and transverse directions. The mechanical loading is restricted to the linear range, which decouples the aging and load behavior. A recursive algorithm has been used to solve the hereditary convolution integral that governs the response of each ply. Classical thin-laminate theory is then used to assemble the individual ply response equations and determine the overall laminate response to general in-plane force and moment loading. The method automatically recovers the ply-level stresses and strains, which are often critical to strength and durability predictions. The model can use either lamina compliance or modulus properties as its basis. Several illustrative examples of long-term laminate response to variable loading are presented and the impact of physical aging is explored. It is shown that for multidirectional laminates, the stiffness of the lamina in the fiber directions can allow simplifications of the model.",

The stitches provide the laminate with the synergistic combination of high mode I interlaminar fracture toughness to resist delamination cracking and healing properties to repair delamination damage. The results show that the fracture toughness of the laminate increased with stitch density, due to higher traction (crack closure) loads exerted by the stitches bridging the delamination. During the healing process these bridging stitches first melt and then flow into the delamination, leading to self-healing with full restoration of the mode I fracture toughness. Furthermore, the stitches were capable of repairing delamination cracks many times larger than the original size of the stitches. The effect of stitch density on the healing process of delamination cracks and restoration of fracture toughness was found to remain approximately the same under multiple repair operations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Cryogenic tensile tests were conducted on the woven-fabric laminates, and the damage development during loading was characterized by AE (acoustic emission) measurements. A finite element model for progressive failure analysis of woven-fabric composite panels was also developed, and applied to simulate the &quot;knee&quot; behavior in the stress-strain responses and the damage behavior in the tensile test specimens. Failure of the epoxy resin matrix in the transverse fiber bundle was predicted to occur using the maximum strain failure criterion. The effect of strain concentrations due to the fabric architecture on the failure strain of the material was considered by incorporating the SVF (strain variation factor) from the meso-scale analysis of a woven-fabric composite unit into the macro-scale analysis of the specimens. A comparison was made between the finite element predictions and the experimental data, and the agreement is good. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

An artificial interlaminar edge crack was forced to propagate under two modes: separation, and shear. Results indicated that the interlayer, located in front of an existing flaw, may increase ift more than sixfold compared with an uninterleaved brittle-matrix composite reference. The effect was stronger in the separation mode than in the shear mode, and seems to increase with thickness of the interlayer. In all cases, delamination propagated through the adhesive layer in a cohesive failure process. The hygrothermal aspect was also studied in this context. It was concluded that selective interleaving at critical spots may produce a significant improvement in the ift of the composite laminate. ?? 1987.",

It is essential to simulate the initial and subsequent evolution process of this kind of damage phenomenon accurately in order to explore the mechanical properties of composite laminates. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the general methodologies on the damage constitutive modeling by continuum damage mechanics (CDM), the various failure criteria, the damage evolution law simulating the stiffness degradation, and the finite element implementation of progressive failure analysis in terms of the mechanical response for the variable-stiffness composite laminates arising from the continuous failure. The damage constitutive modeling is discussed by describing the evolvement of damage tensors and conjugate forces in the CDM theory. The failure criteria which interpret the failure modes and their interaction are compared and some advanced methods such as the cohesive theory which are used to predict the damage evolution properties of composites are also discussed. In addition, the solution algorithm using finite element analysis which implements progressive failure analysis is summarized and several applicable methods which deal with the numerical convergence problem due to singular finite element stiffness matrices are also compared in order to explore the whole failure process and ultimate load-bearing ability of composite laminates. Finally, the multiscale progressive failure analysis as a popular topic which associates the macroscopic with microscopic damage and failure mechanisms is discussed and the extended finite element method as a new finite element technique is expected to accelerate its practical application to the progressive failure analysis of composite laminates.",

          "abstract": "The insertion of local through-thickness reinforcements into dry fiber preforms by stitching provides a possibility to improve the mechanical performance of polymer-matrix composites perpendicular to the laminate plane (out-of-plane). Three-dimensional stress states can be sustained by stitching yarns, leading to increased out-of-plane properties, such as impact resistance and damage tolerance. On the other hand, 3D reinforcements induce dislocations of the in-plane fibers causing fiber waviness and the formation of resin pockets in the stitch vicinity after resin infusion which may reduce the in-plane stiffness and strength properties of the laminate. In the present paper an experimental study on the influence of varying stitching parameters on in-plane and out-of-plane properties of non-crimp fabric (NCF) carbon fiber/epoxy laminates is presented, namely, shear modulus and strength as well as compression after impact (CAI) strength and mode I energy release rate. The direction of stitching, thread diameter, spacing and pitch length as well as the direction of loading (which is to be interpreted as the direction of the three rail shear loading or the direction of crack propagation in case of mode 1 energy release rate testing) were varied, and their effect on the mechanical properties was evaluated statistically. The stitching parameters were found to have ambivalent effect on the mechanical properties. Larger thread diameters and increased stitch densities result in enhanced CAI strengths and energy release rates but deteriorate the in-plane properties of the laminate. On the other hand, a good compromise between both effects can be found with a proper selection of the stitching configurations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

It is known that through-thickness residual stresses are introduced in unsymmetric laminates during the manufacturing process. In this research work, a combined experimental-numerical analysis is proposed to study the effect of moisture ingress on unsymmetric composite laminates by analysing through-thickness residual stresses at dry and saturation states. A range of unsymmetric cross-ply laminates were manufactured using carbon-fibre epoxy pre-preg material. The laminates were subsequently immersed in water to full saturation. The curvatures of dry and saturated test coupons were measured and compared to quantify the effects of moisture ingress on the shapes of the unsymmetric laminates. In addition, a finite element model was developed to predict the experimentally measured curvatures of the dry laminates. By calibrating the numerical model, the through-thickness residual stresses were analysed for different unsymmetric cross-ply layup conditions. The calibrated dry model was then extended to develop a moisture-dependent numerical model in order to incorporate the effect of moisture ingress on the shapes of unsymmetric laminates. The moisture-dependent model was calibrated with the experimentally measured curvatures and then used to predict the through-thickness residual stresses in the fully saturated unsymmetric cross-ply laminates. It is shown that moisture ingress can considerably influence through-thickness residual stresses and thus the shapes of unsymmetric laminates. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

These failure modes need adequate means of analysis and investigation, the major approaches being experimental characterisation and numerical simulations. This research deals with a deformation behaviour and damage in composite laminates due to dynamic bending. Experimental tests are carried out to characterise the behaviour of a woven CFRP material under large-deflection dynamic bending in impact tests carried out to obtain the force-time and absorbed energy profiles for CFRP laminates. Damage in the impacted laminates is analysed using optical microscopy. Numerical simulations are performed to study the deformation behaviour and damage in CFRP for cases of large-deflection bending based on three-dimensional finite-element models implemented in the commercial code Abaqus/Explicit. Multiple layers of bilinear cohesive-zone elements are employed to model the initiation and progression of inter-ply delamination observed in the microscopy studies.

A significant effect of this damage is to reduce the strength of the laminate, particularly in compression; however, owing to the complexity of the damage the precise mechanisms controlling the strength reduction are unclear. In this paper a technique is described for replicating impact damage artificially by including PTFE film delaminants and cut plies during lay-up. Comparisons between real and artificially reproduced damage are made to demonstrate the validity of the technique. Experimental methods of X-radiography and resin injection are developed to allow the mechanisms controlling strength reduction to be assessed, both under tensile and compressive loading. Under tensile load the reduction in strength caused by impact damage is found to be entirely due to fibre cracks and may be estimated by using a net-section calculation. Meanwhile under compression, strength reduction is largely caused by the redistribution of stress resulting from buckling of delaminated plies and may be predicted by calculating stresses in the undelaminated part of the laminate.",

          "abstract": "Various cutting techniques are available to drill holes, but drilling is the most common way in secondary machining of composite materials owing to the need for structure joining. Twist drills are widely used in the industry to produce holes rapidly and economically. Since the twist drill has a chisel edge, increasing the length of a chisel edge will result in an increase in the thrust force generated. Whereas, a saw drill has no chisel edge; it utilizes the peripheral distribution of the thrust force for drilling. As a result, the saw drill can achieve better a machining quality in drilling composite laminates than twist drill. The deviation of cutting edge that occurs in saw drill would result in an increase of thrust force during drilling, causing delamination damage when drilling composite materials in particular. A comprehensive model concerning delamination induced by the thrust force of a deviation saw drill during drilling composite materials has been established in the present study. For a deviation saw drill, the critical thrust force that triggers delamination increases with increasing ??. A lower feed rate has to be used with an increasing deviation saw drill in order to prevent delamination damage. The results agree with real industrial experience. A guide for avoiding the drill deviation during drill regrinding or drill wear has been proved analytically by the proposed model, especially when the deviation ratio (??) affects the critical thrust force. This approach can be extended to examine similar deviation effects of various drills. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Most work on the effects of voids in the literature deals with carbon/epoxy laminates; little experimental data are available on other resin systems of practical importance. The work aims at comparing the effect of voids on carbon/epoxy and carbon/bismaleimide fabric laminates. Specimens with void contents in the range 0 to 6% were produced from both materials. The void content is correlated to ultrasonic attenuation and microscopic inspection was carried out to analyze the sizes and shapes of the voids. The interlaminar shear strength was measured by the short-beam method described in ASTM D2344 and the adequacy of a fracture criterion to represent the experimental data for both materials is assessed. The influence of voids on the interlaminar shear strength of both materials is compared in terms of the corresponding fracture parameters and the shape and the location of the voids. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Specifically, a treated carbon nanotube-reinforced epoxy leaf is inserted at the midplane of the laminates and the fracture properties are measured by end-notched-flexure and 3-point bend tests. It is shown that addition of a small amount of treated carbon nanotubes at the midplane of the composite results in an 85% improvement in the interlaminar fracture toughness, without deteriorating the interlaminar shear strength. This is taken as a strong indication of the unique properties of the protein-treated CNT and as strong support for the concept of selective placement of nanoreinforcement in critical sections with high stress concentrations instead of their wasteful dispersion throughout the structure. The study reveals that the unique contribution of the SP1 protein stems from its ability to bind simultaneously to the CNT and carbon fibers and to the epoxy matrix. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Fracture surface analysis and projected damage area after low velocity impact test were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and ultrasonic C-scan, respectively. Experimental analysis indicates that the incorporation of O-CNFs into carbon fiber/epoxy laminates has improved impact resistance in terms of enhanced peak load, damage initiation energy and reduced damage area in comparison to control laminates. However, the ductility index was found to be decreased with the increase of O-CNFs loading. Micrographs revealed uniform dispersion of O-CNFs in epoxy, good adhesion between O-CNFs and epoxy polymer, and improved interfacial bonding between fiber/matrix that lead to the stronger shift of the impact resistance of the hybrid composites.",

Understanding and improving the structural performance of FMLs therefore depends on characterizing the bridging phenomenon. Previously, mathematical models of bridging load transfer have been developed and verified for simplified circumstances:thin laminates with identical thicknesses and material composition through the laminate, identical crack lengths and delamination sizes, and simple tension loads. These models use a compatibility requirement at the delamination boundary to derive the bridging stress. This paper presents a generalized approach to solving the bridging problem that solves simultaneously for compatibility at every delamination boundary in the laminate, allowing the bridging load distribution to be derived for a laminate of arbitrary layup (different thicknesses and materials) with arbitrary damage (independent crack lengths and delamination sizes and shapes) and subject to arbitrary loading (any combination of applied tension and bending moment). The approach is evaluated by comparing its results to bridging stress distributions derived from finite element analysis. Good agreement was obtained for varied laminate and damage configurations, but some discrepancy exists in the presence of bending. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The chosen temperatures for the experiments were 20 (room temperature), 50 and 90 ??C. The experimental study carried out under dynamic loading enabled the authors to determine the influence that temperature has on the onset of delamination for the entire range of fatigue life of the material, from the low number of cycles zone to the high number of cycles zone. That is, it enabled the plotting of fatigue curves, represented as GImax-N (number of cycles required for the onset of delamination given a certain energy release rate) for an asymmetry coefficient of 0.2 (the ratio between the maximum and minimum fracture energies applied during the dynamic tests). The experimental data obtained were treated with a probabilistic model based on a Weibull distribution which allowed the identification of relevant aspects of the fatigue behavior of the materials such as the estimation of fatigue strength for periods greater than the tested values and the analysis of the reliability of the results.",

In this code an eight-point brick element and the direct Gauss quadrature integration scheme are used through the element thickness to account for the change in material properties from layer to layer. The Newmark scheme is also adopted to perform time integration step by step. In addition, a contact law incorporated with the Newton-Raphson method is applied to calculate the contact force during impact.

The accumulation of different damage modes has been assessed, as a function of number of cycles, using a three-dimensional fatigue progressive damage model (FPDM). The residual strength of the CFRP laminates has been assessed through the combined use of the FPDM with a static three-dimensional progressive damage model (PDM). By simulating the experimental procedure, the FPDM has been applied up to certain number of cycles, to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage and then, the static PDM has been applied (quasi-static tensile loading) to predict final tensile failure of the laminates, which corresponds to the residual strength of the laminate, after it has been exposed at the specific cycles. The models comprised the components of stress analysis performed using finite elements, failure analysis performed using polynomial stress-based failure criteria and material property degradation performed using degradation rules. The analysis has been validated experimentally (a) by assuming a laminate free of internal defects, and (b) by considering the initial defects, which were determined experimentally for certain laminates. The analysis has resulted in an accurate simulation of the experimentally determined fatigue damage accumulation and residual strength. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Due t o the high bending moment at the crack-tip, the specimens fail due to compressive stresses before the delamination could propagate.

An analysis method has been developed to determine the load-deflection and the load-energy release rate relationships in the new test. The new test method has been found to be successful in testing graphite/epoxy laminates containing Kevlar stitches with a density of 64 stitches per square inch.

Drilling is an essential machining operation being used in composite industries for making of holes for bolted joints.

The major drawback is the drilling-induced damage, which mainly occurs due to the direct interaction between the tool and composite laminate. Therefore, there exists a research opportunity to develop cost-effective high-quality machining methods for composite laminates.

The influence of various process parameters including power rating, slurry concentration, and abrasive size on material-removal rate, tool wear rate, and average surface roughness (Ra) has been experimentally investigated. It has been observed that the entry and exit delamination is prevented, and hole circumferential edge quality is improved when holes are produced through rotary-mode ultrasonic drilling as compared to the conventional drilling. It has also been found that with substantial modification in the conventional ultrasonic drilling process, the drilling performance in terms of material-removal rate of glass-epoxy laminates can be significantly improved. The major contribution of the present research endeavor is the development of a novel method of making clean-cut damage-free holes in fiber-reinforced composite laminates.",

The formulation accounts for the nonlinear variation of the in-plane and transverse displacements through the thickness, and abrupt discontinuity in slope of the in-plane displacements at any interface. The analysis is carried out employing a C0 QUAD-8 isoparametric higher-order finite element. It is shown that the shear deformation theory without accounting for the thickness-stretching effect and slope discontinuity in the in-plane displacements may not be adequate for the analysis of fairly thick composite laminates exposed to hygrothermal loading. The significance of retaining various higher-order terms in the present model, in evaluating the deflection, buckling and natural frequency for composite laminates at different moisture concentration and temperature, is brought out through parametric study.",

Analytical solutions for this problem do not exist due to the anisotropic nature and multilayer characteristics of composite laminates. This study uses a three-dimensional finite element (FE) method and experimental measurements to provide physical insight into the scattering phenomena. Good agreement is found between simulations and experimental measurements. The results show that the A(0) Lamb wave scattering at a delamination in composite laminates is much more complicated than the scattering at a defect in isotropic plates. Scatter amplitudes and scatter directivity distributions depend on the delamination size to wavelength ratio and the through-thickness location of the delamination damage. The study also investigates the feasibility of the common experimental practice of simulating delamination damage by bonding masses to the surface of composite laminates for guided wave damage detection and characterization methodologies verifications. The results suggest that care is required to use bonded masses to simulate delamination damage for verifying and optimizing damage characterization techniques. In summary, the results of the investigation help to further advance the use of the A(0) Lamb wave for damage detection and characterization.",

By using this concept and fatigue behavior of the unimpacted laminates, a fatigue life prediction model for the impacted laminates is derived and then verified through the fatigue tests on the impacted laminates under constant amplitude loading. Also, to identify the fluctuation of fatigue life in the laminates, a statistical model is developed by introducing the random variable Z.

The sandwich layup consists of a closed cell polymeric foam layer placed between thin carbon or glass fiber reinforced polymeric composite facings. Attention in this paper is focused on sea water effects on the interfacial mechanical response between foam and facing due to sustained sea water exposure using carefully controlled laboratory conditions. Pre-cracked sandwich composite samples are soaked in sea water for extended periods and interfacial fracture behavior compared against dry specimens. Results indicate that the delamination crack propagates close to the interface in the wet case, while it stays within the foam in the dry case. Significant reduction in fracture toughness due to sea water exposure is observed and needs to be considered in the design of ship structures. The effect of sea water on values of energy release rate are determined experimentally and predicted using the J-integral concept. A good agreement between data and predictions is achieved, indicating a reduction in fracture toughness by 30% due to sustained exposure to sea water. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The proposed damage model is based on damage mechanisms observed at the ply level and hypotheses regarding their effect on material stiffness. Focusing on matrix dominated failure modes, the damage behavior is split into two contributions, damage evolution and damage effect. The prior describes the progression of damage as a function of load, while the latter predicts the effect of this damage by a fourth order tensor relation as function of the current failure mode and stress state. The model relies on six material parameters, whose identification by standard tests is addressed. By combining the damage model with classical lamination theory, the behavior of laminates under plane stress loading is predicted. The capabilities of the proposed damage model are assessed based on comparison to experimental data from the literature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this context, we study the effect of cutting parameters on drilling thrust force and torque during the machining process both experimentally and numerically. A unique three-dimensional (3D) finite element model of drilling in a composite laminate, accounting for complex kinematics at the drill-workpiece interface is developed. Cohesive zone elements are used to simulate interply delamination in a composite. Experimental quantification of drilling-induced damage is performed by means of X-ray micro computed tomography.

          "abstract": "Durability of fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRP) are controlled by the durability of their constituents: reinforcement fibers, resin matrices, and the status of interfaces. A great deal of research has been focused on attempting to assess the relationship between interfacial structure and properties of fiber–matrix composites. It is at the interfacial area where stress concentration develops because of differences in the thermal expansion coefficients between the reinforcement and the matrix phase. A significant mismatch in the environmentally induced degradation of matrix and fiber leads to the evolution of localized stress and strain fields in the FRP composite. The present investigation aims to study the effects of changing hygrothermal conditioning cycles (either by changing relative humidity (RH) and keeping the temperature constant, or by changing the temperature while RH the same is maintained) on moisture gain/loss kinetics and on interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of varied weight fraction glass fiber reinforced epoxy and polyester matrices composites. The mechanical assessment is extended to evaluate the loading rate sensitivity of hygrothermally shocked glass/epoxy and glass/polyester laminates at 2 and 50mm/min crosshead speeds, respectively. Observations on absorption/desorption kinetics are noticed to be dependent on the nature of hygrothermal shock cycle and on the weight fraction of fiber reinforcement. The results of mechanical performance are statistically significant at different stages of conditioning. Shear values are found to be greater at higher crosshead speed for all undertaken situations. Mechanical responses are observed to be dependent on the matrix resin and the type of hygrothermal shock cycle. Very little and limited literature is open to address the important interactions of polymer composites with this kind of realistic environmental situation.",

The quasi-static contact test was performed using a 12.7 mm hemispherically-tipped indentor. On the other hand, impact was conducted using a gas gun with projectiles of the same frontal shape weighing 8.7 g, 17.7 g and 35.5 g. The test speeds were from several m/s to the ballistic limits of the laminates. The impact response was measured using the self-developed laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) system and was subsequently converted into the force and displacement histories. Significant loading rate effects were observed when comparing the laminates loaded quasi-statically to those struck by projectiles with a four-fold difference in mass. These effects included differences in the impact force history, a drastic increase of the force peak and the absorbed energy, and a completely different delamination damage pattern. Thus, the loading rate effect for composite laminates reinforced by glass fibers cannot be overlooked. On the other hand, fiber breakage throughout the plies on the distal side of laminates was found to absorb a significant amount of impact energy. The absorbed energy versus the initial projectile energy for the dynamically loaded specimens, when plotted in a non-dimensionalized manner, was found to have a bilinear relationship regardless of the projectile mass employed. This bilinear line was also closely bounded from below by the quasi-static results.",

To aid in this goal surrogate or “dummy” AFC (DAFC) using a composite core and Kapton® outer layers (to match the longitudinal mechanical and interface properties of the AFC) were employed. These DAFC were used in place of real AFC to expedite test specimen manufacture and evaluation. This allowed efficient investigation of the impact of an integrated AFC-like inclusion on laminate mechanical integrity. Laminates with integrated AFC were additionally tested with signal monitoring to assess AFC health during the test. Investigation into laminate failure was accomplished via a finite element model of the system which was created in ANSYS to investigate failure in the composite plies. Tsai-Wu failure criterion was calculated to investigate laminate failure characteristics. Integration of AFC into CFRP laminates degraded laminate strength by 13.3% using insertion integration and 7.8% using the interlacing integration technique. The finite element model showed that interlacing integration enabled distribution of critical forces over the entire laminate while insertion integration led to critical forces concentrating over the integration region.",

The model agrees well with the experimental data, and it can be used to predict the evolution of damage in composites.",

Considering these crack patterns, matrix shear property and fiber/matrix interfacial strength played an important role in enhancing the delamination properties of woven fabric carbon/epoxy composites.

The strength, residual strength and penetration impact responses of the laminate are measured; the fatigue behavior of the impacted and unimpacted laminates is compared in this study. The fatigue tests were performed at various stress levels under tension-tension (T-T) loadings with a fatigue frequency of 3 Hz. The median rank method and Weibull distribution are applied to predict the failure probabilities of the specimen under monotonic and fatigue testing. The S/N curves are obtained and the S/N curves of these two laminates (with and without impact loading) are compared. The tensile strength is reduced slightly when a relatively low-energy impact is applied; however, a significant decrease with wider data distribution in tensile strength is observed when a higher-energy impact is used. It is also found that both the spread and the cycles of fatigue life are reduced after low-energy impact. C-scanning is used to inspect the damage zone of the specimens subjected to low-energy impact, and it is found that the damage zone increases with an increase in impact energy. The delamination propagation is monitored, and the effect of impact damage on delamination propagation during fatigue testing is revealed in this work. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this work an improved analysis for unidirectional composite delamination specimens is presented, which is based on the results of the last 30 years. The main goal of the present model is the improvement of the global mode decomposition method including four mechanical deformations apart from simple beam theory: Winkler-Pasternak foundation, transverse shear, Saint-Venant effect and crack tip shear deformation, respectively. These effects are investigated separately using a general loading scheme and at the final stage their results are superimposed. The derived model is applied to the mixed-mode I/II single-cantilever beam, the single-leg bending and the universal mixed-mode bending specimens. Beside the present solution three other ones are adopted to compare the results for the compliance and energy release rate of the mentioned specimens. Although the present model shows similar results to the most accurate finite element model, it is simpler and helps us to understand better the mechanisms of the delamination process. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A serial of impact tests was performed with different thicknesses of narrow CFRP laminates to examine the damage process and extent from initiation to complete breakage. The quasi-static three-point bending tests were carried out to characterize the degradation of residual flexural properties induced by the impact. The overall impact energies are clearly separated into three regions by the penetration threshold and crack threshold respectively determined by the EPD. The main damage modes are matrix cracking for lower impact energies, delamination and fiber breakage for middle impact energies and complete breakage for higher impact energies. It is also found that the degradation of normalized residual flexural properties can be divided into three regions using these abovementioned two thresholds, of which the greatest loss occurs in the middle energy region, whilst the maximum reductions of normalized flexural strength and flexural modulus are smaller than 20% in the first region. By comparison, the 6-ply specimens are of lower impact resistance and lower residual flexural properties than the 9-ply specimens under same impact energy; and the residual flexural strength is more sensitive to impact loading than flexural modulus. ?? 2014.",

Numerous key components of aircrafts are made of composite materials, and drilling is often a final operation during assembly. Drilling-induced delamination is a very serious defect that significantly reduces the structural reliability, but it is rather difficult to be detected effectively due to its special location. A novel application of laser ultrasonic technique for the detection of drilling-induced delamination in composites is presented in this paper. A carbon fiber reinforced plastic laminate with drilling holes was made as specimen. A laser ultrasonic system was constructed and experiments were performed to detect the drilling-induced delamination, based on propagation characteristic of ultrasonic waves generated by pulse laser with a wavelength of 1064 nm and pulse duration of 10 ns. A laser interferometer based on two wave mixing is used to measure ultrasonic wave signals, and the morphology features of the delamination are imaged clearly by laser ultrasonic C-scan testing. The results proved that the laser ultrasonic technique is a feasible and effective method for the detection of drilling-induced delamination in composite components. © 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

In this method, an iterative updating process incorporating first-order sensitivity analysis and quadratic programming technique has been proposed for computing fictitious forces in the contact area, which can be used to calculate stiffness parameters of some artificial springs. Finally, the penetration between two delaminated layers in the buckling mode can be effectively prevented by inserting these artificial springs into the overlapped area in the buckling mode. Numerical examples indicated that this method is very efficient for solving the contact problem in buckling analysis. Its accuracy and convergence speed are very high. The numerical results demonstrate that the contact analysis is very important for buckling analysis in some cases.

At least, for aeronautical applications it is important to understand how defects such as voids affect the interlaminar delamination toughness of a composite laminate Therefore an investigation on the influence of voids on the interlaminar delamination toughness of a carbon fiber/epoxy composite in pure modes I and II as well as mixed mode has been performed. Voids are found to have deleterious or no effect on the critical strain energy release rat at crack growth initiation. However, at propagation in pure mode I and mixed mode load-cases presence of voids causes a R-curve behavior. The increase in Gc, which is stron in mode I and moderate in mixed mode is inherent to changes in failure mechanisms. In pure mode I, ply splits are observed to bridge the crack as the crack locally leaps between plies at propagation. In mixed mode (GII/G approx 0.5), the crack propagates in one interface only, multilayer cracking in the crack tip region results in increased Gc at crack propagation. From the observed R-curve behavior it is concluded that pores and voids do not impair the delamination toughness of the HTA/6376C composite in static loading.",

          "abstract": "Automated Fiber Placement is being extensively used in the production of major composite components for the aircraft industry. This technology enables the production of tow-steered panels, which have been proven to greatly improve the structural efficiency of composites by means of in-plane stiffness variation and load redistribution. However, traditional straight-fiber architectures are still preferred. One of the reasons behind this is related to the uncertainties, as a result of process-induced defects, in the mechanical performance of the laminates. This experimental work investigates the effect of the fiber angle discontinuities between different tow courses in a ply on the un-notched and open-hole tensile strength of the laminate. The influence of several manufacturing parameters are studied in detail. The results reveal that &#039;ply staggering&#039; and &#039;0% gap coverage&#039; is an effective combination in reducing the influence of defects in these laminates. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent advances of health monitoring technologies have resulted in development of micro-dimensional sensors that can be embedded into composite laminates. Notwithstanding their small sizes, such inclusions may affect the response of the composite. Damage induced by the peak values of stress concentration around the embedded devices is, in fact, one of the main concerns. To assess this and related issues, we have fabricated a series of samples with and without embedded (dummy) sensors and micro-processors in S2 glass fiber/epoxy laminates, and systematically tested the samples while continuously monitoring the response by the acoustic emission technique. In this manner we have sought to address the process of damage initiation and evolution within the material. The results show that acoustic events begin earlier on during the loading process, in specimens with embedded sensors and the source of the damage is located near the sensors. These early events are associated with matrix failure at the sensor-resin interfaces through micrographic observations.",

Polished thin sections removed from plain glass fiber/nylon composites and their corresponding fiber-metal laminates indicated that the prevailing microstructure was strongly dependent on the rate of cooling from the melt. Mode I and Mode II interlaminar fracture tests on the plain glass fiber reinforced nylon laminates indicated that the values of GIc and GIIc averaged approximately 1100 J/m2 and 3700 J/m2 respectively at all cooling rates. The degree of adhesion between the aluminum alloy and composite substrates was investigated using the single cantilever beam geometry. Here, the measured values of Gc were similar in magnitude to the Mode I interlaminar fracture energy of the composite, tending to increase slightly with increasing cooling rate. The tensile and flexural fracture properties of the plain composites and the fiber metal laminates were found to increase by between 10% and 20% as the cooling rate was increased by two orders of magnitude. This effect was attributed to over-aging of the aluminum alloy plies at elevated temperature during cooling. Finally, fiber metal laminates based on glass fiber/nylon composites were shown to exhibit an excellent resistance to low velocity impact loading. Damage, in the form of delamination, fiber fracture, matrix cracking in the composite plies, and plastic deformation and fracture in the aluminum layer, was observed under localized impact loading. Here, the fast-cooled fiber metal laminates offered superior post-impact mechanical properties at low and intermediate impact energies, yet very similar results under high impact energies.",

          "abstract": "The effects of eight moulding conditions on the mode I delamination resistance of carbon-fibre/PEEK composite (APC2) are discussed in this paper. The moulding conditions are different combinations of forming temperature (380??C and 400??C), forming pressure (0, 0??1 and 1??4 MPa) and cooling rate (0??5, 10 and 50 K min-1). The delamination resistance was evaluated by the determination of four types of GIC values, i.e. (i) GIC, Init, by using the point at the end of the linear part of the force/displacement curve, (ii) GIC, 1mm, by using the point at which crack has travelled 1 mm from the starter film, (iii) GIC, 5%, by using the point of the intersection between the force/displacement curve and a straight line with a 5% off-set of the initial compliance, and (iv) GIC, Prop, by using points during stable crack propagation. Results suggest that the GIC, Init value is most sensitive to the moulding conditions and can be used to divide the specimens into three groups. The same division of specimens can also be made from SEM examination on the amount of drawn matrix adhering to the fibre surfaces, which implies that the GIC values at the beginning of crack growth are related to the bonding strength at the fibre/matrix interface. Comparison of GIC values among specimens with different cooling rates shows that the cooling rate affects GIC values in specimens formed at 400??C but not in specimens formed at 380??C, and that the cooling rate effect is significant only in GIC values measured during the initial crack growth from the starter film, i.e. GIC, Init, GIC, 5% and GIC, 1mm. Voids smaller than 100 ??m in diameter were observed in specimens moulded in simplified two-stage pressure processes which are commonly used for fabricating laminates in the study of cooling rate effects. The results from this study did not show any effect of voids on the measured values of GIC. This paper concludes that moulding conditions can affect the delamination resistance of carbon-fibre/PEEK composites, and supports our previous results that the fibre/matrix interface bond strength affects delamination resistance during the initial crack growth from the starter film. The results from this paper also suggests that an increase in cooling rate decreases delamination resistance during the initial crack growth from the starter film, but such an effect is significant only in specimens formed at 400??C. ?? 1994.",

New methods of evaluating the effective or apparent critical strain-energy release rate for stitched laminates are presented. Stitching results in an excellent improvement in GIIc The apparent GIIc was 5 to 15 times that of the unstitched laminates, depending on the stitching parameters. There appears to be an optimum stitch density at which the toughness will be a maximum.

          "abstract": "The availability of high performance low cost carbon fibre in materials such as non crimp fabrics (NCF) has led to renewed interest in advanced composites for automotive applications. A wide range of structural applications are possible; however, amongst other considerations the performance of these materials under crash and impact loading is a primary concern. For crashworthiness simulation of large scale composite structures compromise modelling methods are needed that can balance accuracy and modelling efforts with acceptable computational (CPU) costs. For this reason, a modelling technique is used that represents the laminate as a stack of plies using layers of shell elements. These layers are tied, at the ply interfaces, using special constraint elements to represent the mechanical elastic and delamination energy absorption characteristics of the resin rich interface. Delamination is an important aspect of composite integrity and, in order to assess this, a test program of candidate textile reinforced composites under Mode I, Mode II and mixed mode loading has been conducted. This data, together with ply failure data, has been used in the proposed model to simulate a complex demonstrator automotive structural component; details of the numerical models and example results are presented. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The dispersion curves and the corresponding stress and displacement mode shapes of the lower order Lamb modes are obtained analytically and the interaction of the S0 mode with delaminations at different interfaces in a composite laminate is then studied both by finite element analysis and by experiment. It is shown that the amplitude of the reflection of the S0 mode from a delamination is strongly dependent on the position of the delamination through the thickness of the laminate and that the delamination locations corresponding to the maximum and minimum reflectivity correspond to the locations of maximum and minimum shear stress across the interface in the S0 mode",

          "abstract": "Delamination is a major problem associated with drilling fiber-reinforced composite materials that, in addition to reducing the structural integrity of the material, also results in poor assembly tolerance and has the potential for long-term performance deterioration. Delamination-free in drilling different fiber reinforced thermoset composites is the main objective of the present paper. Therefore the influence of drilling and material variables on thrust force, torque and delamination of GFRP composites was investigated experimentally. Drilling variables are cutting speed and feed. Material variable include matrix type, filler and fiber shape. Drilling process was carried out on cross-winding/polyester, continuous-winding with filler/polyester, chopped/polyester, woven/polyester and woven/epoxy composites. A simple inexpensive accurate technique was developed to measure delamination size. The results show that the presence of sand filler in continuous-winding composites not only raised the values of cutting forces and push-out delamination but also increased their values with increasing cutting speed. In contrast, increasing the cutting speed in drilling cross-winding, woven and chopped composites reduces the push-out delamination as a result of decreasing the thrust force. The thrust forces in drilling continuous-winding composite are more than three orders of magnitude higher than those in the cross-winding composites. Chopped composites have lower push-out delamination than those made from woven fibers. For the same fiber shape, the peel-up and push-out delaminations of woven/epoxy composite are lower than that for woven/polyester composites. Delamination, chipping and spalling damage mechanisms were observed in drilling chopped and continuous-winding composites. In drilling woven composites the delamination was observed at different edge position angles due to the presence of the braids that made by the interlacing of two orthogonal directions of fibers tows (warp and fill). Delamination-free in drilling cross-winding composites was achieved using variable feed technique. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The laminated specimen is represented as an assembly of sublaminates, each of which is modelled as an elastic beam partly connected to the other by a deformable interface, in turn considered to be a continuous distribution of elastic-brittle springs. Based on Timoshenko&#039;s beam theory, a set of six differential equations, accompanied by suitable boundary conditions, governs the problem. By adopting the interfacial stresses as the main unknowns, the differential problem is solved analytically, and the contributions of the opening and sliding fracture modes are evaluated directly. Moreover, explicit expressions are determined for the interfacial stresses, internal forces, and displacements, as well as for the compliance, energy release rate, and mode-mixity angle. The predictions of the model are to some extent similar to those of analogous mechanical models in the literature and appear in good agreement with both numerical and experimental results. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This method is able to efficiently analyze both the macroscopic and microscopic elastic-viscoplastic properties of angle-ply CFRP laminates fully modeled with microstructures consisting of fibers and a matrix. Using the proposed method, the elastic-viscoplastic analysis of angle-ply carbon fiber/epoxy laminates with various laminate configurations is performed to investigate their Poisson&#039;s ratios in the viscoplastic region. It is revealed that, for a range of laminate configurations, the through-the-thickness Poisson&#039;s ratios exhibit negative values which become increasingly negative as the viscoplastic deformation progresses in the laminates. The effect of strain rate on this increasing negativity is also demonstrated, and microscopic mechanisms are investigated to explain this trend. It is further shown that the increasing negativity significantly affects microscopic interlaminar stress distributions.",

The proposed fatigue damage model is identified using Fracture Mechanics tests like DCB, ENF and MMB. Simulations of delamination under fatigue loading are performed and results are successfully compared with reported experimental data on HTA/6376C unidirectional material. Delamination crack growth with variable fatigue amplitude is also performed and simulation results show that the proposed fatigue damage law can also accommodate this variable amplitude phenomenon.

This paper focuses on the experimental characterization of the damage resistance of laminates made from T800/3900-2 carbon/epoxy tape material to impact by high velocity ice spheres, i.e., simulated hail ice (SHI). The failure threshold energy (FTE) defining the onset of damage was found for three panel thicknesses (1.59, 3.11, and 4.66 mm), each impacted by three ice diameters (38.1, 50.8, and 61.0 mm). Non-destructive investigation techniques were used to detect, map, and characterize the delaminated area. A regression analysis was used to quantitatively determine the FTE of the tape laminates, which was found to closely match previous woven carbon/epoxy FTE data. Both data sets were found to exhibit a linear and common relationship to the ratio of panel thickness to ice diameter (H/D). The resulting delamination patterns of the current and previous panels were found to be similar at damage initiation, but to differ for higher damage states. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental results showed that fiber failure is a prominent phenomenon and an important reason for the knee point on the dent depth-impact energy curves of composite laminates subjected to low-velocity impact. The finite element model to predict the permanent indentation incorporated fiber failure in the anisotropic elasto-plasticity theory. Delamination was also taken into account in the finite element model using cohesive elements. The permanent indentation numerically predicted agreed well with the experimental results. Composite laminates with different fiber-resin systems were analyzed which showed that the effect of different materials especially different fibers on the permanent indentation can be reflected in the present model. Numerical results showed different ways of energy dissipation which also reflected different damage modes before and after the knee point. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

It was found that the tensile strengths for the composite exhibited strain rate strengthen effects, and the ultimate strains were nearly independent of strain rate. The two-peak phenomenon of the tensile stress-strain curves was discussed, which was thought to be related to the waviness of the carbon fiber woven layers that restricted the delamination and matrix splitting.",

However, their through-the-thickness performance lacks some of the most demanding physical and mechanical property requirements for structural applications, such as aerospace vehicles and military components.

This paper reviews the progress made to date on i) the techniques developed for integration of CNTs/ CNFs into FRPs, and ii) the effects of the addition of these nanofillers on the interlaminar properties, such as such interlaminar shear strength, interlaminar fracture toughness and impact damage resistance and tolerance, of FRPs.

First, the paper considers the initiation and progression of transverse cracking. This progression is evaluated by an iterative procedure combining a generalized model for evaluating the stress field in a cracked laminate with a statistical distribution of strengths in the 90??layer. Comparisons between the results obtained by this procedure and the experimental results of the literature show that for very low crack densities the progression of transverse cracking is governed by a strength distribution associated with weakness areas resulting from the presence of particular defects in laminates. Next, for higher crack densities the strength distribution in the 90??layer can be described by a pseudo-normal distribution associated with the other defects. Finally, the paper considers the development of delamination which is initiated from the crack tips in the case of some laminates. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The following alterations and novelties are introduced: 1) The appropriate form and shape of specimens with glued additional metallic tabs was elaborated allowing to avoid the premature break of specimen arms; 2) Original loading device was designed to transfer high load directly to crack faces, and additional measurement of crack opening was proposed (as in the case of UD composite) to find the bridging law; 3) The convenient analytical formula for G Ic calculation was proposed and used; 4) Instead of traditional R curve which is geometry dependent it was proposed to characterize the delamination resistance as function of crack opening displacement.

While the damage mechanisms of composites under dynamic compression loading are well-understood, measuring the occurrence of damage in a non-invasive manner is challenging. Toward this end, we investigate the electrical response of an embedded percolating carbon nanotube network in woven fabric/epoxy composites to dynamic compression loading. The percolating network is established through the use of a non-uniform dispersion of carbon nanotubes, achieved using a fiber sizing agent. The resulting conductive network is sensitive to delamination and damage occurring near the fiber surfaces. The dynamic mechanical response of the composite specimens is explored using Hopkinson bar methodology. Definite increases in baseline resistance of the conductive composite specimens are seen after repeated impacts demonstrating the ability of the carbon nanotube network of these conductively modified composites to respond electrically to damage induced during dynamic loading.",

Knowledge of the influence of the weave structure on the mechanical properties of the composite is essential to properly optimize the design of structural components. The focus of this work is to investigate the influence of the type of weave used for fabric reinforcement in polymers particularly on the in-plane shear mechanical performance. The selected materials are carbon fibers and epoxy resin. The laminates are manufactured by vacuum infusion. Three woven structures are selected for manufacturing the composite laminates: (a) a plain weave with unidirectional orientation in the warp direction, (b) a plain weave with balanced properties in the warp and weft directions and (c) a 2/2 twill weave with balanced properties in the warp and weft directions. The laminates are tested according to the ASTM D 4255 standard by a two-rail shear test under quasi-static monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. The resulting stress-strain curves are used to study the initial in-plane shear modulus and its evolution (which directly correlates with material damage) and the hardening produced by plastic strain. The results show that for vacuum infusion manufacturing, the weave structure has an influence on the resulting fiber and void volume fractions and, consequently, on the mechanical performance. However, for similar fiber volumes, the weave structure is found to have little effect on the experimental results.",

In the present study the residual Mode II delamination fracture toughness was characterized following exposure to low cycle fatigue loading and moisture at 50??C. The composites investigated included balanced fabric-epoxy systems composed of glass, aramid and carbon fibres. Experimental results have shown that the matrix and fibre/matrix interface dominated behaviour in shear loading and was insensitive to short-term exposure to both fatigue and moisture. Moreover, the carbon/epoxy material exhibited enhanced resistance to Mode II delamination after short exposure due to relaxation of the processing induced thermal stresses. However, long exposure caused damage to both the matrix and the fibre matrix interface, manifested in reduction of the strain energy release rates at failure. Fractographs supported the experimentally determined results. While unconditioned failure surfaces were typified by shear hackles, fatigued specimens indicated gradual elimination of the hackles, fibre fracture and matrix abrasion. When the composites were moisturized, examinations of the fracture surfaces revealed plasticization of the matrix following short-term conditioning with gradual disappearance of the typical shear striations and appearance of voids, following long-term exposure. ?? 1989.",

Impact response was measured by conducting a series of low-velocity impact test. Impact force and the force time history were recorded and analyzed. It was found that the maximum impact load increased up to a threshold value at which it plateaus while the energy absorption in the structure increased with increasing impact energy. Post-impact optical image showed a change in damage area with increasing impact energy. The impact damage threshold energy for the sandwich structure was clearly shown in the range of impact energy between 7.84 J and 11.76 J where damages including delamination of the skins and global bending of the structure were observed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Under complex environments such as continuous or cyclic loads, the stiffness degradation for the laminated composites such as the carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites is an important physical and mechanical response to the damage and failure evolution. It is essential to simulate the initial and subsequent evolution process of this kind of damage phenomenon accurately in order to explore the mechanical properties of composite laminates. This paper gives a comprehensive review on the general methodologies on the damage constitutive modeling by continuum damage mechanics (CDM), the various failure criteria, the damage evolution law simulating the stiffness degradation, and the finite element implementation of progressive failure analysis in terms of the mechanical response for the variable-stiffness composite laminates arising from the continuous failure. The damage constitutive modeling is discussed by describing the evolvement of damage tensors and conjugate forces in the CDM theory. The failure criteria which interpret the failure modes and their interaction are compared and some advanced methods such as the cohesive theory which are used to predict the damage evolution properties of composites are also discussed. In addition, the solution algorithm using finite element analysis which implements progressive failure analysis is summarized and several applicable methods which deal with the numerical convergence problem due to singular finite element stiffness matrices are also compared in order to explore the whole failure process and ultimate load-bearing ability of composite laminates. Finally, the multiscale progressive failure analysis as a popular topic which associates the macroscopic with microscopic damage and failure mechanisms is discussed and the extended finite element method as a new finite element technique is expected to accelerate its practical application to the progressive failure analysis of composite laminates. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

The same model is used for the formation of damage developing during both low-velocity/low-energy impact tests and CAI tests. The different impact and CAI elementary damage types are taken into account, i.e. matrix cracking, fiber failure and interface delamination. Experimental tests and model results are compared, and this comparison is used to highlight the laminate failure scenario during residual compression tests.

          "abstract": "A test method, with specimen design similar to that proposed by O&#039;Brien et al. (see [23-26]) but under 3-point bending, is proposed to measure the critical strain energy release rate (G c) for delamination in fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) under out-of-plane (transverse) loading. Unlike end-notch-flexure (ENF) test or double-cantilever-beam (DCB) test that are currently used, the new method does not require an insert film or a pre-crack to initiate delamination. Instead, the delamination was initiated from a FRP layer of the same composition but with different fibre orientation. Difference of the fibre orientation used in this study was 90° layer in the mid-thickness and the rest 0° layers. Under 3-point bending, matrix shear cracking was firstly initiated in the 90° layer, mimicking the mechanism for delamination initiation in the FRP when subjected to transverse loading. The matrix shear cracking led to delamination in the adjacent interlaminar regions, of which area can be measured after the test. Calculation of G c was based on &quot;area method&quot;, that is, dividing the total energy loss by the delamination area. The G c was compared with that from plate specimens of the same composition and fibre lay-up but subjected to transverse point loading. The comparison suggests that very similar G c values were produced from the two types of testing, even though unstable crack growth occurred under 3-point bending and stable crack growth under transverse point loading. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential of quantifying delamination resistance of FRP under the transverse loading conditions. © Springer 2005.",

The broad classes of glass-fiber-reinforced systems that were examined include 2D plain-woven laminates, 3D orthogonally woven monolithic systems, and 3D orthogonally woven laminates. The experimental results indicate that the 3D laminates consistently had greater damage tolerance than the 2D laminates and the 3D monolithic composites. The enhanced damage tolerance of the 3D systems is due to unique energy absorption mechanisms, which involve the crimped portion of z-tows.",

          "abstract": "Through the application of a simple model, the concept of damage accumulation has been used to predict the fatigue life of TP-based composite materials at a test temperature higher than its glass transition temperature. This work was aimed at studying the off-axis tension-tension fatigue behavior of woven-ply C/PPS laminates which consists of three primary stages: (i) In the initial phase of cyclic loading, damage accumulates rapidly along with a matrix plasticization under the form of intra-laminar cracking which may initiate in multiple locations, but preferably at the interfaces between fibers and matrix at the crimps - (ii) The second stage is characterized by a steady damage growth rate and little damage accumulation - (iii) Damage (mostly debonding and interlaminar cracks) generalizes rapidly during the last stage ultimately resulting in extensive delamination and fiber bundles pull-out. It also appears that the fatigue behavior is ascribed to the highly ductile and time-dependent behavior of matrix-rich regions due to the non-planar structure of woven plies. Finally, a simple analytical model was applied, and proved to be adequate to capture the different stages of damage scenario, with excellent correlation to the experimental data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The contact force is calculated by the modified Hertz contact law in conjunction with the loading and unloading processes. In the case of composite laminate, the impact-induced damage including matrix cracking and delamination are predicted by the appropriated failure criteria and the damaged area are plotted. Two types of shell structure, cylindrical and spherical shells, are considered in this paper. The effects of various parameters, such as shell curvature, clamped or simple supported boundary conditions and impactor velocity are examined through the parametric study. Numerical results show that structures with greater stiffness, such as smaller curvature and clamped boundary condition, result to a larger contact force and a smaller deflection. The impact response of the structure is proportional to the impactor velocity.",
