          "abstract": "The contravariant form of the Navier-Stokes equations in a fixed curvilinear coordinate system is well known. However, when the curvilinear coordinate system is time-varying, such as when a body-fitted grid is used to compute the flow over a compliant surface, considerable care is needed to handle the momentum term correctly. The present paper derives the complete contravariant form of the Navier-Stokes equations in a time-dependent curvilinear coordinate system from the intrinsic derivative of contravariant vectors in a moving frame. The result is verified via direct transformation. These complete equations are then applied to compute incompressible flow in a 2D channel with prescribed boundary motion, and the significant effect of some terms which are sometimes either overlooked or assumed to be negligible in such a derivation is quantified. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We present numerical results that validate this error estimate for the advection-diffusion equation, and we document that such estimate is also valid for the Navier-Stokes equations at moderate or high Reynolds number.

It was pointed out by a few authors (and not widely known apparently) that it can also lead to a less accurate approximate solution than the usual u · ∇ u form. We give a different explanation of this effect related to (i) resolution of the Bernoulli pressure, and (ii) the scaling of the coupling between velocity and pressure error with respect to the Reynolds number. We show analytically that (i) the difference between the two nonlinearities is governed by the difference in the resolution of the Bernoulli and kinematic pressures, and (ii) a simple, linear grad-div stabilization ameliorates much of the bad scaling of the velocity error with respect to Re. The rotation form does have superior conservation properties to the alternatives and it appears to be amenable to more efficient preconditioners. Thus, the rotational form with grad-div stabilization is a promising method. We also give experiments that show bad velocity approximation is tied to poor pressure resolution in either form. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The RDG method, originally developed for the compressible Euler equations, is extended to discretize viscous and heat fluxes in the Navier-Stokes equations using a so-called inter-cell reconstruction, where a smooth solution is locally reconstructed using a least-squares method from the underlying discontinuous DG solution. Similar to the recovery-based DG (rDG) methods, this reconstructed DG method eliminates the introduction of ad hoc penalty or coupling terms commonly found in traditional DG methods. Unlike rDG methods, this RDG method does not need to judiciously choose a proper form of a recovered polynomial, thus is simple, flexible, and robust, and can be used on arbitrary grids. The developed RDG method is used to compute a variety of flow problems on arbitrary meshes to demonstrate its accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and versatility. The numerical results indicate that this RDG method is able to deliver the same accuracy as the well-known Bassi-Rebay II scheme, at a half of its computing costs for the discretization of the viscous fluxes in the Navier-Stokes equations, clearly demonstrating its superior performance over the existing DG methods for solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "We develop a fully implicit scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations, in conservative form, for low to intermediate Mach number flows. Simulations in this range of flow regime produce stiff wave systems in which slow dynamical (advective) modes coexist with fast acoustic modes. Viscous and thermal diffusion effects in refined boundary layers can also produce stiffness. Implicit schemes allow one to step over the fast wave phenomena (or unresolved viscous time scales), while resolving advective time scales. In this study we employ the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method and develop a new physics-based preconditioner. To aid in overcoming numerical stiffness caused by the disparity between acoustic and advective modes, the governing equations are transformed into the primitive-variable form in a preconditioning step. The physics-based preconditioning incorporates traditional semi-implicit and physics-based splitting approaches without a loss of consistency between the original and preconditioned systems. The resulting algorithm is capable of solving low-speed natural circulation problems (M ??? 10- 4) with significant heat flux as well as intermediate speed (M ??? 1) flows efficiently by following dynamical (advective) time scales of the problem. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.",

We apply this generalized Ehlers group, in the presence of Killing isometries, to vacuum metrics with hydrodynamic duals to develop a formalism for solution-generating transformations of Navier-Stokes fluids.

The issue of how to correctly specify numerical boundary conditions for these methods has been outstanding since the birth of the second-order methodology a decade and a half ago. It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary conditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connection between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail.",

We study the performance of the solvers as a function of mesh size, Reynolds number, time step, and algorithm parameters.

Fourier analysis shows that the existing skew-symmetric forms of the convective term result in reduced aliasing errors relative to the conservation form. Several formulations of the convective term, including a new formulation proposed for cubically nonlinear terms, are tested in direct numerical simulation (DNS) of decaying compressible isotropic turbulence both in chemically inert (small density fluctuations) and reactive cases (large density fluctuations) and for different degrees of resolution. In the DNS of reactive turbulent flow, the new cubic skew-symmetric form gives the most accurate results, consistent with the spectral error analysis, and at the lowest cost.

The LB method is a Lagrangian discretization of a discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation. We introduce an alternative, fourth-order discretization scheme and compare results with those of the LB discretization and with finite-difference schemes applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in primitive-variable form. A Chapman-Enskog expansion of the PDE system predicts that the macroscopic behavior corresponds to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with additional &#039;compressibility error&#039; of order Mach number squared. We numerically demonstrate convergence of the BGK schemes to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and quantify the errors associated with compressibility and discretization effects. When compressibility error is smaller than discretization error, convergence in both grid spacing and time step is shown to be second-order for the LB method and is confirmed to be fourth-order for the fourth-order BGK solver. However, when the compressibility error is simultaneously reduced as the grid is refined, the LB method behaves as a first-order scheme in time. ?? 1995.",

In this paper, we consider a modification $\partial_t u = \Delta u + \tilde B(u,u)$ of this equation, where $\tilde B$ is an averaged version of the bilinear operator $B$ (where the average involves rotations and Fourier multipliers of order zero), and which also obeys the cancellation condition $\langle \tilde B(u,u), u \rangle = 0$ (so that it obeys the usual energy identity). By analysing a system of ODE related to (but more complicated than) a dyadic Navier-Stokes model of Katz and Pavlovic, we construct an example of a smooth solution to such a averaged Navier-Stokes equation which blows up in finite time. This demonstrates that any attempt to positively resolve the Navier-Stokes global regularity problem in three dimensions has to use finer structure on the nonlinear portion $B(u,u)$ of the equation than is provided by harmonic analysis estimates and the energy identity. We also propose a program for adapting these blowup results to the true Navier-Stokes equations.",

It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary con- ditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incom- pressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connec- tion between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail.",

The splitting is obtained through an algebraic approximate factorization of the matrix arising from space and time discretization of the original equations. Several schemes based on approximate factorization are investigated. For some of these methods a formal analogy with well known time advancing schemes, such as the projection Chorin-Temam&#039;s, can be pointed out. Features and limits of this analogy (that was earlier introduced in B. Perot, J. Comp. Phys. 108 (1993) 51-58) are addressed. Other, new methods can also be formulated starting from this approach: in particular, we introduce here the so called Yosida method, which can be investigated in the framework of quasi-compressibility schemes. Numerical results illustrating the different performances of the different methods here addressed are presented for a couple of test cases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

We introduce a continuous mapping between a fixed reference configuration and the time-varying domain. By writing the Navier-Stokes equations as a conservation law for the independent variables in the reference configuration, the complexity introduced by variable geometry is reduced to solving a transformed conservation law in a fixed reference configuration. The spatial discretization is carried out using the Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured meshes of triangles, while the time integration is performed using an explicit Runge-Kutta method. For general domain changes, the standard scheme fails to preserve exactly the free-stream solution which leads to some accuracy degradation, especially for low order approximations. This situation is remedied by adding an additional equation for the time evolution of the transformation Jacobian to the original conservation law and correcting for the accumulated metric integration errors. A number of results are shown to illustrate the flexibility of the approach to handle high-order approximations on complex geometries. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The first one is an evolution equation satisfied by Pu, the projection of the solution on the Stokes space - the space of divergence free vector fields with a normal trace equal to zero - and the second one is a quasi-stationary elliptic equation satisfied by (I - P) u, the projection of the solution on the orthogonal complement of the Stokes space. We establish optimal regularity results for Pu and (I - P) u. We also study the existence of weak solutions to the three-dimensional instationary Navier-Stokes equations for more regular data, but without any smallness assumption on the initial and boundary conditions. ?? 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The method uses a staggered storage arrangement for the pressure and velocity variables and adopts an edge-based data structure and assembly procedure which is valid for arbitrary n-sided polygonal meshes. Edge formulas are presented for assembling the ALE form of the momentum and pressure equations. An implicit multi-stage time integrator is constructed that is geometrically conservative to the precision of the arithmetic used in the computation. The method is shown to be second-order-accurate in time and space for general time-dependent polygonal meshes. The method is first evaluated using several well-known unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes problems before being applied to a periodically forced aeroelastic problem and a transient free surface problem.

The fluid velocity corresponds to the normal to the horizon while the rate of change in the fluid energy is equal to minus the rate of change in the horizon cross-sectional area. The analysis is performed in the Membrane Paradigm approach to black holes and it holds for a general non-singular null hypersurface, provided a large scale hydrodynamic limit exists. Thus we find, for instance, that the dynamics of the Rindler acceleration horizon is also described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

          "abstract": "The pressure is a somewhat mysterious quantity in incompressible flows. It is not a thermodynamic variable as there is no ‘equation of state’ for an incompressible fluid. It is in one sense a mathematical artefact-a Lagrange multiplier that constrains the velocity field to remain divergence-free; i.e., incompressible-yet its gradient is a relevant physical quantity: a force per unit volume. It propagates at infinite speed in order to keep the flow always and everywhere incompressible; i.e., it is always in equilibrium with a time-varying divergence- free velocity field. It is also often difficult and/or expensive to compute. While the pressure is perfectly well- defined (at least up to an arbitrary additive constant) by the governing equations describing the conservation of mass and momentum, it is (ironically) less so when more directly expressed in terms of a Poisson equation that is both derivable from the original conservation equations and used (or misused) to replace the mass conservation equation. This is because in this latter form it is also necessary to address directly the subject of pressure boundary conditions, whose proper specification is crucial (in many ways) and forms the basis of this work. Herein we show that the same principles of mass and momentum conservation, combined with a continuity argument, lead to the correct boundary conditions for the pressure Poisson equation: viz., a Neumann condition that is derived simply by applying the normal component of the momentum equation at the boundary. It usually follows, but is not so crucial, that the tangential momentum equation is also satisfied at the boundary. KEY",

Navier boundary conditions can be expressed in the form w = (2 K - A) v . T and v . n = 0 on the boundary, where v is the velocity, w the vorticity, n a unit normal vector, T a unit tangent vector, and A is a bounded measurable function on the boundary. Such solutions have been considered for simply connected domains by Clopeau, Mikeli\&#039;{c}, and Robert under the assumption that the initial vorticity is bounded, and by Lopes Filho, Nussenzveig Lopes, and Planas under the assumption that the initial vorticity lies in L^p for some p &gt; 2. We extend the results of these authors to non-simply connected domains. Assuming a particular bound on the growth of the L^p-norms of the initial vorticity with p, and also assuming that the boundary and the function A have fractionally greater smoothness, we obtain a bound on the rate of convergence in L^2 uniform over any finite time interval to the solution of the Euler equations in the vanishing viscosity limit. We also show that if the initial velocity is in H^3 and the boundary is C^3, then solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations with Navier boundary conditions converge in L^2 uniformly over any finite time interval to the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations with the usual no-slip boundary conditions as we let the function A grow large uniformly on the boundary.",

The LB method is a Lagrangian discretization of a discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation. We introduce an alternative, fourth-order discretization scheme and compare results with those of the LB discretization and with finite-difference schemes applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in primitive-variable form. A Chapman-Enskog expansion of the PDE system predicts that the macroscopic behavior corresponds to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with additional ‘compressibility error’ of order Mach number squared. We numerically demonstrate convergence of the BGK schemes to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and quantify the errors associated with compressibility and discretization effects. When compressibility error is smaller than discretization error, convergence in both grid spacing and time step is shown to be second-order for the LB method and is confirmed to be fourth-order for the fourth-order BGK solver. However, when the compressibility error is simultaneously reduced as the grid is refined, the LB method behaves as a first-order scheme in time.",

Darcy&#039;s law is the key experimental (or phenomenological) equation employed to model ground water flow. Yet, this phenomenological equation can be linked to a more fundamental microscale model of flow through the pore spaces of the porous material. This paper provides an experimental verification of the relationships between Darcy&#039;s law (macroscale) and the Navier-Stokes equations (microscale) for actual complex pore geometries of a granular material. The pore geometries are experimentally obtained through state-of-the-art X-ray computer assisted micro-tomography. From the numerical modelling of the microscale flow based on actual pore geometries, it is possible to quantify and visualize the development of pore-scale fluid preferential flow-paths through the porous material, and to assess the importance of pore connectivity in soil transport properties. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As in the original projection method developed by Chorin, we tirst solve diffusion-convection equations to predict intermediate velocities which are then projected onto the space of divergence-free vector fields. By introducing more coupling between the diffusion&lt;onvection step and the projection step we obtain a temporal discretiza- tion that is second-order accurate. Our treatment of the diffusion-convection step uses a specialized higher order Godunov method for differencing the nonlinear convective terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms at high Reynolds number. The Godunov procedure is second-order accurate for smooth flow and remains stable for discontinuous initial data, even in the zero-viscosity limit. We approximate the projection directly using a Galerkin procedure that uses a local basis for discretely divergence-free vector fields. Numerical results are presented validating the convergence properties of the method. We also apply the method to doubly periodic shear-layers to assess the performance of the method on more difficult RppkatiOnS",

The modified integral form is conservative and seeks the solution of the absolute velocity. This approach is different from previous conservative differential forms . [1-3] whose reference frame is not inertial. Keeping the reference frame being inertial results in simpler mathematical derivation to the governing equation which includes one dyadic product of velocity vectors in the convective term, whereas the previous . [2,3] needs to obtain the time derivative with respect to non-inertial frames causing an additional dyadic product in the convective term. The scheme is implemented in a second-order accurate Navier-Stokes solver and maintains the order of the accuracy. After this verification, the scheme is validated for a pitching airfoil with very high frequencies. The simulation results match very well with the experimental results .

This airfoil simulation also provides detailed vortical structures near the trailing edge and time-evolving aerodynamic forces that are used to investigate the mechanism of the thrust force generation and the effects of the trailing edge shape.

The basis of the formulation is the streamline upwind concept, which provides an accurate multidimensional generalization of optimal one-dimensional upwind schemes. When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods. The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step.

          "abstract": "Recent interest in the development of a unifying framework among direct numerical simulations, large-eddy simulations, and statistically averaged formulations of the Navier–Stokes equations, provides the motivation for the present paper. Toward that goal, the properties of the residual (subgrid-scale) stress of the temporally filtered Navier–Stokes equations are carefully examined. This includes the frame-invariance properties of the filtered equations and the resulting residual stress. Causal time-domain filters, parametrized by a temporal filter width $0&lt;\Delta&lt;\infty$, are considered. For several reasons, the differential forms of such filters are preferred to their corresponding integral forms; among these, storage requirements for differential forms are typically much less than for integral forms and, for some filters, are independent of $\Delta$. The behavior of the residual stress in the limits of both vanishing and infinite filter widths is examined. It is shown analytically that, in the limit $\Delta\rightarrow0$, the residual stress vanishes, in which case the Navier–Stokes equations are recovered from the temporally filtered equations. Alternately, in the limit $\Delta\rightarrow\infty$, the residual stress is equivalent to the long-time averaged stress, and the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are recovered from the temporally filtered equations. The predicted behavior at the asymptotic limits of filter width is further validated by numerical simulations of the temporally filtered forced, viscous Burger’s equation. Finally, finite filter widths are also considered, and both a priori and a posteriori analyses of temporal similarity and temporal approximate deconvolution models of the residual stress are conducted for the model problem.",

          "abstract": "We present a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in convection-dominated flows using triangular and tetrahedral meshes. The scheme is based on a semi-explicit temporal discretization with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the Stokes operator. The nonlinear term is discretized in divergence form by using the local Lax-Friedrichs fluxes; thus, local conservativity is inherent. Spatial discretization of the Stokes operator has employed both equal-order (Pk - Pk) and mixed-order (Pk - Pk-1) velocity and pressure approximations. A second-order approximate algebraic splitting is used to decouple the velocity and pressure calculations leading to an algebraic Helmholtz equation for each component of the velocity and a consistent Poisson equation for the pressure. The consistent Poisson operator is replaced by an equivalent (in stability and convergence) operator, namely that arising from the interior penalty discretization of the standard Poisson operator with appropriate boundary conditions. This yields a simpler and more efficient method, characterized by a compact stencil size. We show the temporal and spatial behavior of the method by solving some popular benchmarking tests. For an unsteady Stokes problem, second-order temporal convergence is obtained, while for the Taylor vortex test problem on both semi-structured and fully unstructured triangular meshes, spectral convergence with respect to the polynomial degree k is obtained. By studying the Orr-Sommerfeld stability problem, we demonstrate that the Pk - Pk method yields a stable solution, while the Pk - Pk-1 formulation leads to unphysical instability. The good performance of the method is further shown by simulating vortex shedding in flow past a square cylinder. We conclude that the proposed discontinuous Galerkin method with the Pk - Pk formulation is an efficient scheme for accurate and stable solution of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in convection-dominated flows. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The proposed methodology is based on a streamfunction-velocity formulation of the two-dimensional steady-state Navier-Stokes equations representing incompressible fluid flows in two-dimensional domains. Similar formulations are also possible for three-dimensional fluid flows. The main advantage of our formulation is that it avoids the difficulties associated with the computation of vorticity values, especially on solid boundaries, encountered when solving the streamfunction-vorticity formulations. Our formulation also avoids the difficulties associated with solving pressure equations of the conventional velocity-pressure formulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. We describe the new formulation of the Navier-Stokes equatio ns and use this formulation to solve a couple of fluid flow problems. We use a biconjugate gradient method to obtain the numerical solutions of the fluid flow problems and provide detailed comparison data for the lid driven cavity flow problem. It is discovered that our new formulation successfully provides high accuracy solutions for the benchmark problem. In addition, we also solve a problem of flow in a rectangular cavity with aspect ratio 2 and compare our results qualitatively and quantitatively with numerical and experimental results available in the literature. In all cases, we obtain high accuracy solutions with little additional cost. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

We extend a discontinuous finite element discretization originally considered for hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations to the case of the Navier–Stokes equations by treating the viscous terms with a mixed formulation. The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.",

The dominant forcing functions are found as solutions of a Lyapunov equation and the response functions are found as the distinct solutions of a related Lyapunov equation. Neither the forcing nor the response functions can be identified with the normal modes of the linearized dynamical operator. High variance levels are sustained in these systems under stochastic forcing, largely by transfer of energy from the mean flow to the perturbation field, despite the exponential stability of all normal modes of the system. From the perspective of modal analysis the explanation for this amplification of variance can be traced to the non-normality of the linearized dynamical operator. The great amplification of perturbation variance found for Couette and Poiseuille flow implies a mechanism for producing and sustaining high levels of variance in shear flows from relatively small intrinsic or extrinsic forcing disturbances (22 Refs.)",

In particular, improved pressure boundary conditions of high order in time are introduced that minimize the effect of erroneous numerical boundary layers induced by splitting methods. A new family of stiffly stable schemes is employed in mixed explicit/implicit time-intgration rules. These schemes exhibit much broader stability regions as compared to Adams-family schemes, typically used in splitting methods. Their stability properties remain almost constant as the accuracy of the integration increases, so that robust third- or higher-order time-accurate schemes can readily be constructed that remain stable at relatively large CFL number. The new schemes are implemented within the framework of spectral element discretizations in space so that flexibility and accuracy is guaranteed in the numerical experimentation. A model Stokes problem is studied in detail, and several examples of Navier-Stokes solutions of flows in complex geometries are reported. Comparison is made with the previously used first-order in time spectral element splitting and non-splitting (e.g., Uzawa) schemes. High-order splitting/spectral element methods combine accuracy in space and time, and flexibility in geometry, and thus can be very efficient in direct simulations of turbulent flows in complex geometries.",

          "abstract": "The use of graphics hardware for general purpose computations allows scientists to enormously speed up their numerical codes. We presently investigate the impact of this technology on our computational fluid dynamics solver for the three-dimensional two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which is based on the level set technique and applies Chorin’s projection approach. To our knowledge, this is the first time, that a two-phase solver for the Navier-Stokes equations profits from the computation power of modern graphics hardware. As part of our project, a Jacobi preconditioned conjugate gradient solver for the pressure Poisson equation and the reinitialization of the level set function of our CPU based code were ported to the graphics processing unit (GPU). They are implemented in double precision and parallelized by the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We obtain speedups of 16.2 and 8.6 for the Poisson solver and the reinitialization on one GPU in contrast to a single CPU. Our implementation scales close to perfect on multiple GPUs of a distributed memory cluster. This results in excellent speedups of 115.8 and 53.7 on eight GPUs of our cluster. Furthermore our whole multi-GPU accelerated solver achieves an impressive speedup of 69.6 on eight GPUs/CPUs.",

Two numerical approaches were proposed in this work, which are based on the pressure correction process with DQ discretization. The essence in these approaches is the requirement that the continuity equation must be satisfied on the boundary. Meanwhile, suitable boundary condition for pressure correction equation was recommended. Through a test problem of three-dimensional driven cavity flow, the performance of two approaches was comparatively studied in terms of the accuracy. The numerical results were obtained for Reynolds numbers of 100, 200, 400 and 1000. The present results were compared well with available data in the literature.

In the computational space, the Cartesian velocity components and the pressure are defined at the center of a control volume, while the volume fluxes are defined at the mid-point on their corresponding cell faces. The momentum equations are integrated semi-implicitly by the approximate factorization technique. The intermediate velocities are interpolated onto the faces of the control volume to form the source terms of the pressure Poisson equation, which is solved iteratively with a multigrid method. The compatibility condition of the pressure Poisson equation is satisfied in the same manner as in a staggered-grid method; mass conservation can be satisfied to machine accuracy. The pressure boundary condition is derived from the momentum equations. Solutions of both steady and unsteady problems including the large eddy simulation of a rotating and stratified upwelling flow in an irregular container established the favorable accuracy and efficiency of the present method.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, considerable effort has been placed on developing efficient and robust solution algorithms for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on preconditioned Krylov methods. These include physics-based methods, such as SIMPLE, and purely algebraic preconditioners based on the approximation of the Schur complement. All these techniques can be represented as approximate block factorization (ABF) type preconditioners. The goal is to decompose the application of the preconditioner into simplified sub-systems in which scalable multi-level type solvers can be applied. In this paper we develop a taxonomy of these ideas based on an adaptation of a generalized approximate factorization of the Navier-Stokes system first presented in [A. Quarteroni, F. Saleri, A. Veneziani, Factorization methods for the numerical approximation of Navier-Stokes equations, Computational Methods in Applied Mechanical Engineering 188 (2000) 505-526]. This taxonomy illuminates the similarities and differences among these preconditioners and the central role played by efficient approximation of certain Schur complement operators. We then present a parallel computational study that examines the performance of these methods and compares them to an additive Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) algorithm. Results are presented for two and three-dimensional steady state problems for enclosed domains and inflow/outflow systems on both structured and unstructured meshes. The numerical experiments are performed using MPSalsa, a stabilized finite element code. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In this work, error estimates for splitting algorithms are developed which are uniform in the viscosity $\nu$ as it becomes small for either two- or three-dimensional fluid flow in all of space. In particular, it is proved that standard viscous splitting converges uniformly at the rate $C\nu\Delta t$, Strang-type splitting converges at the rate $C\nu(\Delta t)^2$, and also that solutions of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations differ by $C\nu$ in this case. Here $C$ depends only on the time interval and the smoothness of the initial data. The subtlety in the analysis occurs in proving these estimates for fixed large time intervals for solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in two space dimensions. The authors derive a new long-time estimate for the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations to achieve this. The results in three space dimensions are valid for appropriate short time intervals; this is consistent with the existing mathematical theory.",

          "abstract": "We present a new finite-difference numerical method to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a collocated discretization in space on a logically Cartesian grid. The method shares some common aspects with, and it was inspired by, the Box scheme. It uses centered second-order-accurate finite-difference approximations for the spatial derivatives combined with semi-implicit time integration. The proposed method is constructed to ensure discrete conservation of mass and momentum by discretizing the primitive velocity-pressure form of the equations. The continuity equation is enforced exactly (to machine accuracy) at the collocated locations, whereas the momentum equations are evaluated in a staggered manner. This formulation preempts the appearance of spurious pressure modes in the embedded elliptic problem associated with the pressure. The method shows uniform order of accuracy, both in space and time, for velocity and pressure. In addition, the skew-symmetric form of the non-linear advection term of the Navier-Stokes equations improves discrete conservation of kinetic energy in the inviscid limit, to within the order of the truncation error of the time integrator. The method has been formulated to accommodate different types of boundary conditions; fully periodic, periodic channel, inflow-outflow and lid-driven cavity; always ensuring global mass conservation. A novel aspect of this finite-difference formulation is the derivation of the discretization near boundaries using the weak form of the equations, as in the finite element method. The method of manufactured solutions is utilized to perform accuracy analysis and verification of the solver. To assess the applicability of the new method presented in this paper, four realistic flow problems have been simulated and results are compared with those in the literature. These cases include a lid-driven cavity, backward-facing step, Kovasznay flow, and fully developed turbulent channel. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

It is shown that, at least up to and including fourth order, the velocity attains the classical order of accuracy without further constraints. However, in case of a time-dependent gradient operator, which can appear in case of time-varying meshes, additional order conditions need to be satisfied to ensure the correct order of accuracy. Furthermore, the pressure is only first-order accurate unless additional order conditions are satisfied. Two new methods that lead to a second-order accurate pressure are proposed, which are applicable to a certain class of three- and four-stage methods. A special case appears when the boundary conditions for the continuity equation are independent of time, since in that case the pressure can be computed to the same accuracy as the velocity field, without additional cost. Relevant computations of decaying vortices and of an actuator disk in a time-dependent inflow support the analysis and the proposed methods. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

This approach has been increasingly used over the last few years to solve mathematical problems. The originality of this work consists in the association of PGD with a spectral collocation method to solve transfer equations as well as Navier-Stokes equations. In the first stage, the PGD method and its association with spectral discretization is detailed. This approach was tested for several problems: the Poisson equation, the Darcy problem, Navier-Stokes equations (the Taylor Green problem and the lid-driven cavity). In the Navier-Stokes problems, the coupling between velocity and pressure was performed using a fractional step scheme and a PN-PN-2 discretization. For all problems considered, the results from PGD simulations were compared with those obtained by a standard solver and/or with the results found in the literature. The simulations performed showed that PGD is as accurate as standard solvers. PGD preserves the spectral behavior of the errors in velocity and pressure when the time step or the space step decreases. Moreover, for a given number of discretization nodes, PGD is faster than the standard solvers. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A novel numerical method is developed that integrates boundary-conforming grids with a sharp interface, immersed boundary methodology. The method is intended for simulating internal flows containing complex, moving immersed boundaries such as those encountered in several cardiovascular applications. The background domain (e.g. the empty aorta) is discretized efficiently with a curvilinear boundary-fitted mesh while the complex moving immersed boundary (say a prosthetic heart valve) is treated with the sharp-interface, hybrid Cartesian/immersed-boundary approach of Gilmanov and Sotiropoulos [A. Gilmanov, F. Sotiropoulos, A hybrid cartesian/immersed boundary method for simulating flows with 3d, geometrically complex, moving bodies, Journal of Computational Physics 207 (2005) 457-492.]. To facilitate the implementation of this novel modeling paradigm in complex flow simulations, an accurate and efficient numerical method is developed for solving the unsteady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in generalized curvilinear coordinates. The method employs a novel, fully-curvilinear staggered grid discretization approach, which does not require either the explicit evaluation of the Christoffel symbols or the discretization of all three momentum equations at cell interfaces as done in previous formulations. The equations are integrated in time using an efficient, second-order accurate fractional step methodology coupled with a Jacobian-free, Newton-Krylov solver for the momentum equations and a GMRES solver enhanced with multigrid as preconditioner for the Poisson equation. Several numerical experiments are carried out on fine computational meshes to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for standard benchmark problems as well as for unsteady, pulsatile flow through a curved, pipe bend. To demonstrate the ability of the method to simulate flows with complex, moving immersed boundaries we apply it to calculate pulsatile, physiological flow through a mechanical, bileaflet heart valve mounted in a model straight aorta with an anatomical-like triple sinus. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This issuse is explored in sufficient detail in this paper so as to actually prove the theorem for at least some situations. Additionally, like the original/primitive equations that require no BC for the pressure, the new results establish the same thing when the PPE approach is employed.",

The general domain decomposition approach is particularized for the reduced-order finite element approximation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with hyper-reduction. When solving the reduced incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, instabilities in the form of large gradients of the recovered reduced-order unknown at the subdomain interfaces may appear, which is the motivation for the design of additional stability terms giving rise to penalty matrices.

High order continuity NURBS is used to construct the finite-dimensional spaces for both velocity and pressure. Variational form is derived from the governing equations with primitive variables and the DOFs due to additional variables are not necessary. There is a novel k-refinement which has spectral convergence of least squares functional. The method also has same advantages as isogeometric analysis like automatic mesh generation and exact geometry representation. Several benchmark problems are solved using the proposed method. The results agree well with the benchmark solutions available in literature. The results also show good performance in mass conservation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Despite numerous improvements to the methodology, however, imposing physical boundary conditions with projection-based fluid solvers remains difficult, and obtaining high-order accuracy may not be possible for some choices of boundary conditions. In this work, we present an unsplit, linearly-implicit discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a staggered grid along with an efficient solution method for the resulting system of linear equations. Since our scheme is not a fractional-step algorithm, it is straightforward to specify general physical boundary conditions accurately; however, this capability comes at the price of having to solve the time-dependent incompressible Stokes equations at each timestep. To solve this linear system efficiently, we employ a Krylov subspace method preconditioned by the projection method. In our implementation, the subdomain solvers required by the projection preconditioner employ the conjugate gradient method with geometric multigrid preconditioning. The accuracy of the scheme is demonstrated for several problems, including forced and unforced analytic test cases and lid-driven cavity flows. These tests consider a variety of physical boundary conditions with Reynolds numbers ranging from 1 to 30000. The effectiveness of the projection preconditioner is compared to an alternative preconditioning strategy based on an approximation to the Schur complement for the time-dependent incompressible Stokes operator. The projection method is found to be a more efficient preconditioner in most cases considered in the present work. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we consider the problem of drag minimization for a body in relative motion in a fluid by controlling the velocity through the body boundary. With this aim, we handle with an optimal control approach applied to the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We use the Lagrangian functional approach and we consider the Lagrangian multiplier method for the treatment of the Dirichlet boundary conditions, which include the control function itself. Moreover, we express the drag coefficient, which is the functional to be minimized, through the variational form of the Navier-Stokes equations. In this way, we can derive, in a straightforward manner, the adjoint and sensitivity equations associated with the optimal control problem, even in the presence of Dirichlet control functions. The problem is solved numerically by an iterative optimization procedure applied to state and adjoint PDEs which we approximate by the finite element method.

Some volumic control terms are directly introduced in the governing equations in order to prescribe immersed boundary conditions.

A multigrid local mesh refinement is also implemented, using the multi-level Zoom Flux Interface Correction (FIC) method, in order to increase the precision where it is needed in the domain. At each time step, some iterations of the augmented Lagrangian method combined with a preconditioned Krylov algorithm allow the divergence-free velocity and pressure fields be solved for.

They have the property of not generating spurious oscillations across shocks and contact discontinuities. In general, shocks can be captured within 1-2 grid points. These schemes are relatively simple to understand and easy to implement into a new or existing computer code. One can modify a standard three-point central-differences code by simply changing the conventional numerical dissipation term into the one designed for the TVD scheme. For steady-state applications, the only difference in computation is that the current schemes require a more elaborate dissipation term for the explicit operator; no extra computation is required for the implicit operator. Numerical experiments with the proposed algorithms on a variety of steady-state airfoil problems illustrate the versatility of the schemes. ?? 1986.",

Navier–Stokes equations are not adequate to model these flows since they are based on small deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium. To model these flows, a number of extended hydrodynamics or generalized hydrodynamics models have been proposed over the past fifty years, along with the direct simulation Monte Carlo ͑DSMC͒ approach. One of these models is the Burnett equations which are obtained from the Chapman–Enskog expansion of the Boltzmann equation ͓with Knudsen number ͑Kn͒ as a small parameter͔ to O(Kn 2). With the currently available computing power, it has been possible in recent years to numerically solve the Burnett equations. However, attempts at solving the Burnett equations have uncovered many physical and numerical difficulties with the Burnett model. As a result, several improvements to the conventional Burnett equations have been proposed in recent years to address both the physical and numerical issues; two of the most well known are the &#039;&#039;augmented Burnett equations&#039;&#039; and the &#039;&#039;BGK–Burnett equations.&#039;&#039; This paper traces the history of the Burnett model and describes some of the recent developments. The relationship between the Burnett equations and the Grad&#039;s 13 moment equations is elucidated by employing the Maxwell–Truesdell–Green iteration. Numerical solutions are provided to assess the accuracy and applicability of Burnett equations for modeling flows in the continuum–transition regime. The important issue of surface boundary conditions is addressed. Computations are compared with the available experimental data, Navier–Stokes calculations, Burnett solutions of other investigators, and DSMC solutions as much as possible.",

This system couples velocity and pressure unknowns, thus requiring a special technique for handling. We consider the Navier-Stokes equations in velocity - kinematic pressure variables as well as in velocity - Bernoulli pressure variables. The latter leads to the rotation form of nonlinear terms. This form of the equations plays an important role in our studies. A consistent stabilization method is considered from a new view point. Theory and numerical results in the paper address both the accuracy of the discrete solutions and the effectiveness of solvers and a mutual interplay between these issues when particular stabilization techniques are applied. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

Based upon making the fluid&#039;s total viscous dissipation over a given time interval stationary subject to the constraint of the Navier-Stokes equations, the variational problem looks overconstrained and intractable. However, introducing a nonunique velocity decomposition, u(x,t)=phi(x,t) + nu(x,t), &quot;opens up&quot; the variational problem so that what is presumed a single allowable point over the velocity domain u corresponding to the unique solution of the Navier-Stokes equations becomes a surface with a saddle point over the extended domain (phi,nu). Complementary or dual variational problems can then be constructed to estimate this saddle point value strictly from above as part of a minimization process or below via a maximization procedure. One of these reduced variational principles is the natural and ultimate generalization of the upper bounding problem developed by Doering and Constantin. The other corresponds to the ultimate Busse problem which now acts to lower bound the true dissipation. Crucially, these reduced variational problems require only the solution of a series of linear problems to produce bounds even though their unique intersection is conjectured to correspond to a solution of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations.",

The emphasis is put on the projection step, which enforces incompressibility. Three types of variational approximations are reviewed. In the first one, the projection step is solved as a div-grad problem with velocity test functions satisfying (at first glance) a paradoxical Dirichlet condition. In the second method, the projection step is still solved as a div-grad problem but the velocity test functions satisfy a boundary condition only for the normal component. In the third approach the projection step is solved in the form of a Poisson equation supplemented with a Neumann boundary condition. The first method is shown to be legitimate and economical for finite element approximations, whereas the second one is shown to be useful for spectral approximations. The third one is probably the easiest to implement since it avoids the problem of the mass matrix occurring in the two others. Though the second and third approaches do not directly involve a inf-sup condition, this condition is pointed out to be necessary to establish convergence and rule out possible spurious pressure. Finally some links between these algorithms and some preconditioning techniques of the Uzawa operator are shown.",

The fluid has zero energy density in equilibrium, which implies incompressibility at first order in gradients, and its stress tensor (both at and away from equilibrium) satisfies a quadratic constraint, which determines its energy density away from equilibrium. The entire dynamics to second order is encoded in one first order and six second order transport coefficients, which we compute. We classify entropy currents with non-negative divergence at second order in relativistic gradients. We then verify that the entropy current obtained by pulling back to the fluid surface the area form at the null horizon indeed has a non-negative divergence. We show that there are distinct near-horizon scaling limits that are equivalent either to the relativistic gradient expansion we discuss here, or to the non-relativistic expansion associated with the Navier-Stokes equations discussed in previous works. The latter expansion may be recovered from the present relativistic expansion upon taking a specific non-relativistic limit.",

Therefore, this paper shows how to construct a logically consistent fluid-dynamic traffic model from basic laws for the acceleration and interaction of vehicles. These considerations lead to the gas-kinetic traffic equation of Paveri-Fontana. Its stationary and spatially homogeneous solution implies equilibrium relations for the `fundamental diagram&#039;, the variance-density relation, and other quantities which are partly difficult to determine empirically. Paveri-Fontana&#039;s traffic equation allows the derivation of macroscopic moment equations which build a system of non-closed equations. This system can be closed by the well proved method of Chapman and Enskog which leads to Euler-like traffic equations in zeroth-order approximation and to Navier-Stokes-like traffic equations in first-order approximation. The latter are finally corrected for the finite space requirements of vehicles. It is shown that the resulting model is able to withstand the above mentioned criticism.",

The complexity of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of projection methods, and it is shown the have the same stability properties as the Poisson-based pressure-correction techniques, either in standard or rotational form. The first-order (in time) version of the method is proved to have the same convergence properties as the classical first-order projection techniques. Numerical tests reveal that the second-order version of the method has the same convergence rate as its second-order projection counterpart as well. The method is suitable for parallel implementation and preliminary tests show excellent parallel performance on a distributed memory cluster of up to 1024 processors.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a numerical study of two ways for discretizing and linearizing the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. One approach consists in first applying a semi-discretization in time by a fully implicit ??-scheme. Then, in each discrete time, the equations are linearized by a fixed point iteration. The number of iterations to reach a given stopping criterion is a priori unknown in this approach. In the second approach, Rosenbrock schemes with s stages are used as temporal discretization. The non-linearity of the Navier-Stokes equations is treated internally in the Rosenbrock methods. In each discrete time, exactly s linear systems of equations have to be solved. The numerical study considers five two-dimensional problems with distinct features. Four implicit time stepping schemes and five Rosenbrock methods are involved. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "Energy-conserving methods have recently gained popularity for the spatial discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper implicit Runge-Kutta methods are investigated which keep this property when integrating in time. Firstly, a number of energy-conserving Runge-Kutta methods based on Gauss, Radau and Lobatto quadrature are constructed. These methods are suitable for convection-dominated problems (such as turbulent flows), because they do not introduce artificial diffusion and are stable for any time step. Secondly, to obtain robust time-integration methods that work also for stiff problems, the energy-conserving methods are extended to a new class of additive Runge-Kutta methods, which combine energy conservation with L-stability. In this class, the Radau IIA/B method has the best properties. Results for a number of test cases on two-stage methods indicate that for pure convection problems the additive Radau IIA/B method is competitive with the Gauss methods. However, for stiff problems, such as convectiondominated flows with thin boundary layers, both the higher order Gauss and Radau IIA/B method suffer from order reduction. Overall, the Gauss methods are the preferred method for energy-conserving time integration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

The formulation is particularly suitable for simulating the evolution of three-dimensional disturbances in boundary layers. A key advantage is that there are only three governing equations for three primary dependent variables. Another advantage is that no wall boundary conditions are needed for the vorticity. Instead the conditions placed on the velocity are linked to the vorticity field through integral constraints based on the definition of vorticity.\nNumerical methods are presented in the context of application to the three-dimensional boundary layer over a rotating disc. The discretization scheme uses spectral expansions in the wall-normal and azimuthal (or spanwise) directions and compact finite differences in the radial (or streamwise) direction. The scheme is implemented so that the advantages of spectral convergence can be combined with the use of an efficient line-iteration solution procedure. The linearized form of the new velocity-vorticity method is validated for the case of convective instabilities evolving over both rigid and compliant discs.",

However, the Immersed Boundary Method is known to be first-order accurate and usually smears out the solutions. In this paper, we propose an immersed interface method for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with singular forces along one or several interfaces in the solution domain. The new method is based on a second-order projection method with modifications only at grid points near or on the interface. From the derivation of the newmethod,we expect fully second-order accuracy for the velocity and nearly second-order accuracy for the pressure in the maximum norm including those grid points near or on the interface. This has been confirmed in our numerical experiments. Furthermore, the computed solutions are sharp across the interface. Nontrivial numerical results are provided and compared with the Immersed Boundary Method. Meanwhile, a new version of the Immersed Boundary Method using the level set representation of the interface is also proposed in this paper.",

Their application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations has also been recently considered, although the subject is far from being fully explored. In this work, we propose a new approach for the DG numerical solution of the INS equations written in conservation form. The inviscid numerical fluxes both in the continuity and in the momentum equation are computed using the values of velocity and pressure provided by the (exact) solution of the Riemann problem associated with a local artificial compressibility perturbation of the equations. Unlike in most of the existing methods, artificial compressibility is here introduced only at the interface flux level, therefore resulting in a consistent discretization of the INS equations irrespectively of the amount of artificial compressibility introduced. The discretization of the viscous term follows the well-established DG scheme named BR2. The performance and the accuracy of the method are demonstrated by computing the Kovasznay flow and the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and for various degrees of polynomial approximation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The goals of thework were (i) identification and analysis of all possible splitting methods of second-order split- ting accuracy, and (ii) determination of consistent boundary conditions that yield second-order-accurate solutions. Exact and approximate block-factorization tech- niques were used to construct second-order splitting methods. It has been found that only three canonical types (D, P, and M) of splitting methods are nondegenerate, and all other second-order splitting schemes are either degenerate or equivalent to them. Investigation of the properties of the canonical methods indicates that a method of type D is recommended for computations in which zero divergence is preferred, while a method of type P is better suited to cases where highly accurate pressure is more desirable. The consistent boundary conditions on the tentative velocity and pressure have been determined by a procedure that consists of approximation of the split equations and the boundary limit of the result. It has been found that the pres- sure boundary condition is independent of the type of fractional-step methods. The consistent boundary conditions on the tentative velocity were determined in terms of the natural boundary condition and derivatives of quantities available at the current time step (to be evaluated by extrapolation). Second-order fractional-step methods that admit the zero-pressure-gradient boundary condition have been derived by using a transformation that involves the “delta form” pressure. The boundary condition on the newtentative velocity becomes greatly simplified due to improved accuracy built into the transformation",

By a combination of order-of-magnitude analysis, appeal to available analytical solutions, and reanalysis of some data from the literature, it is shown that the Navier-Stokes equations can be linearized if the Reynolds number is less than about 10. Further analysis shows that the linear Stokes equations can be replaced by the simpler Reynolds lubrication equation if the wavelength of the dominant aperture variations is about three times greater than the mean aperture. However, this criterion does not seem to be strongly obeyed by all fractures. The Reynolds equation (i.e., the local cubic law) may therefore suffice in estimating fracture permeabilities to within a factor of about 2, but more accurate estimates will require solution of the Stokes equations. Similarly, estimates of mean aperture based on inverting transmissivity data may have errors of a factor of two if any version of the local cubic law is used to relate transmissivity to mean aperture.",

By Fourier analysis applied to a model equation, an optimal choice is made for the operator to be inverted in the defect correction iteration. As a smoothing technique for the multigrid method, collective symmetric point Gauss-Seidel relaxation is applied with as the basic solution technique: exact Newton iteration applied to a continuously differentiable, first-order upwind discretization of the full Navier-Stokes equations. For non-smooth flow problems, the convergence results obtained are already competitive with those of well-established Navier-Stokes methods. For smooth flow problems, the present method performs better than any standard method.

          "abstract": "This paper examines the long-term behavior, dissipativity and unconditional nonlinear stability properties of time integration algorithms for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, including both direct schemes and fractional step/projection methods. The algorithms are termed nonlinear unconditionally stable if, in the absence of a forcing term but for arbitrary initial conditions, the computed kinetic energy decreases for arbitrary step sizes (i.e., L2-stability). Such an a priori stability estimate is a characteristic feature of the Navier-Stokes system. Similarly, the algorithms are said to exhibit asymptotic ??t-independent long-term dissipative behavior if, as the continuum flow generated by the Navier-Stokes equations, the algorithmic flow also exhibits an absorbing set (and a maximal attractor). Both direct and fractional step methods are described which inherit these fundamental properties of the Navier-Stokes system for any time step size. Moreover, a subclass of algorithms which retain these strong notions of nonlinear stability and long-term dissipative behavior is identified which, in addition, has the remarkable property of being linear within the time step. The key implication is that no iterations are required to compute the solution within a time step. A specific member of this class is shown to possess the same absorbing set as the continuum Navier-Stokes system. A second order accurate, unconditionally stable method is also identified which retains the property of linearity within a time step. Numerical analysis and computational aspects involved in the implementation of these methods are addressed in detail and illustrated in representative numerical simulations. ?? 1994.",

No additional solution of the pressure-Poisson equation or evaluation of Navier-Stokes operator is needed. The scheme is supplied with a local error estimation and time-step control algorithm.

The derivation of equations follows a three-step method recently developed for the PML of linearized Euler equations. To increase the efficiency of the PML, a pseudo mean flow is introduced in the formulation of absorption equations. The proposed PML equations will absorb exponentially the difference between the nonlinear fluctuation and the prescribed pseudo mean flow. With the nonlinearity in flux vectors, the proposed nonlinear absorbing equations are not formally perfectly matched to the governing equations as their linear counter-parts are. However, numerical examples show satisfactory results. Furthermore, the nonlinear PML reduces automatically to the linear PML upon linearization about the pseudo mean flow. The validity and efficiency of proposed equations as absorbing boundary conditions for nonlinear Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are demonstrated by numerical examples. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Both methods eliminate the pressure term as part of the formulation, thus avoiding fractional-step time integration. They yield rapid convergence and are free of spurious modes in the Orr-Sommerfeld spectra. They are also efficient, although the operation count is of order N2 (N is the number of modes in the infinite direction). These methods have been used for extensive direct numerical simulations of transition and turbulence. A new time-integration scheme, with low storage requirements and good stability properties, is also described. ?? 1991.",

The approach involves truncating the Cartesian cells at the boundary surface to create new cells which conform to the shape of the surface. We discuss in some detail the problems unique to the development of a cut cell method on a staggered grid. Methods for calculating the fluxes through the boundary cell faces, for representing pressure forces and for calculating the wall shear stress are derived and it is verified that the new scheme retains second-order accuracy in space. In addition, a novel &quot;cell-linking&quot; method is developed which overcomes problems associated with the creation of small cells while avoiding the complexities involved with other cell-merging approaches. Techniques are presented for generating the geometric information required for the scheme based on the representation of the boundaries as quadric surfaces. The new method is tested for flow through a channel placed oblique to the grid and flow past a cylinder at Re = 40 and is shown to give significant improvement over a staircase boundary formulation. Finally, it is used to calculate unsteady flow past a hemispheric protuberance on a plate at a Reynolds number of 800. Good agreement is obtained with experimental results for this flow. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The IB method uses a set of discrete delta functions to spread the entire singular force exerted by the immersed boundary to the nearby fluid grid points. Our method instead incorporates part of this force into jump conditions for the pressure, avoiding discrete dipole terms that adversely affect the accuracy near the immersed boundary. This has been implemented for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a high-resolution finite-volume method for the advective terms and a projection method to enforce incompressibility. In the projection step, the correct jump in pressure is imposed in the course of solving the Poisson problem. This gives sharp resolution of the pressure across the interface and also gives better volume conservation than the traditional IB method. Comparisons between this method and the IB method are presented for several test problems. Numerical studies of the convergence and order of accuracy are included.",

La méthode lagrangienne (particule) est utilisée dans les régions où la convection est dominante alors qu&#039;autour des obstacles, dans les zônes où les effets visqueux sont importants, une méthode de différences finies eulérienne mieux adaptée est employée. Les résultats obtenus dans le cas d&#039;écoulement autour d&#039;un profil NACA 0012 comparés avec les résultats expérimentaux montrent que la méthode est consistante. La méthode est appliquée ensuite à l&#039;étude de l&#039;interaction entre un profil et un cylindre circulaire montrant ainsi les possibilités de la méthode. Cette méthode peut être étendue facilement aux cas 3D. A domain decomposition method which combines a vortex method and a finite difference method is presented to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in velocity-vorticity form. The lagrangian vortex method is used in the flow region where convective effects are dominant whereas the finite difference method using velocity-vorticity in this paper is used in the flow region where the convective effects may be dominant. Unsteady flow around an isolated NACA 0012 is studied. The comparison between numerical and experimental data show that the method is consistent for simulating two dimensional flows. Flow interaction between an airfoil and a circular cylinder has been analyzed showing the abilities of the method in multibodies flow simulation. The velocity-vorticity formulation can be extended easily in three dimensional flow simulation.",

The asymptotic analysis identifies the acoustic time change of the heat-release rate as the dominant source of sound in {low-Mach}-number flow. The viscous and buoyancy forces enter the computation of the second-order &#039;incompressible&#039; pressure in {low-Mach}-number flow in a similar way as they enter the pressure computation in incompressible flow, except for a nonzero velocity-divergence constraint. If the flow equations are averaged over an acoustic wave period, the averaged velocity tensor describes the net acoustic effect on the averaged flow field. Removing acoustics from the equations altogether leads to the {low-Mach}-number equations, which allow for large temperature and density changes as opposed to the Boussinesq equations.",

The new method removes the difficulty in specifying incident waves through an inflow boundary with the presence of strong wave reflection. Instead, only the open (radiation) boundary condition is needed in the simulation. By using different source functions, the writers are able to generate various wave trains, including the linear monochromatic wave, irregular wave, Stokes wave, solitary wave, and cnoidal wave. By comparing numerical results with analytical solutions, the writers have shown that the proposed method can accurately generate not only small amplitude waves but also nonlinear waves in both intermediate and shallow water. This method has important applications of simulating wavecurrent interaction, wave shoaling on a relatively steep slope, and wave-structure interaction where wave reflection is significant",

It extends previous work on optimization for inviscid flow. The theory is applied to a system defined by the partial differential equations of the flow, with the boundary shape acting as the control. The Fr echet derivative of the cost function is determined via the solution of an adjoint partial differential equation, and the boundary shape is then modified in a direction of descent. This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached. Each design cycle requires the numerical solution of both the flow and the adjoint equations, leading to a computational cost roughly equal to the cost of two flow solutions. The cost is kept low by using multigrid techniques, in conjunction with preconditioning to accelerate the convergence of the solutions. The power of the method is illustrated by designs of wings and wingbody combinations for long range transport aircraft. Satisfactory designs are usually obtained with 2040 design cycles.",

A novel continuous boundary force (CBF) method is proposed for solving the Navier-Stokes equations subject to the Robin boundary condition. In the CBF method, the Robin boundary condition is replaced by the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition and a volumetric force term added to the momentum conservation equation. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is used to solve the resulting Navier-Stokes equations. We present solutions for two- and three-dimensional flows subject to various forms of the Robin boundary condition in domains bounded by flat and curved boundaries. The numerical accuracy and convergence are examined through comparison of the SPH-CBF results with the solutions of finite difference or finite-element method. Considering the no-slip boundary condition as a special case of the slip boundary condition, we demonstrate that the SPH-CBF method accurately describes both the no-slip and slip conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "The Chimera method was developed three decades ago as a meshing simplification tool. Different components are meshed independently and then glued together using a domain decomposition technique to couple the equations solved on each component. This coupling is achieved via transmission conditions (in the finite element context) or by imposing the continuity of fluxes (in the finite volume context). Historically, the method has then been used extensively to treat moving objects, as the independent meshes are free to move with respect to the others. At each time step, the main task consists in recomputing the interpolation of the transmission conditions or fluxes. This paper presents a Chimera method applied to the Navier-Stokes equations. After an introduction on the Chimera method, we describe in two different sections the two independent steps of the method: the hole cutting to create the interfaces of the subdomains and the coupling of the subdomains. Then, we present the Navier-Stokes solver considered in this work. Implementation aspects are then detailed in order to apply efficiently the method to this specific parallel Navier-Stokes solver. We conclude with some examples to demonstrate the reliability and application of the proposed method. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

          "abstract": "A method of numerically integrating the Navier-Stokes equations for certain three-dimensional incompressible flows is described. The technique is presented through application to the particular problem of describing thermal convection in a rotating annulus. The equations, in cylindrical polar co-ordinate form, are integrated with respect to time by a marching process, together with the solving of a Poisson equation for the pressure. A suitable form of the finite difference equations gives a computationally-stable long-term integration with reasonably faithful representation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow.Trigonometric interpolation techniques provide accurate (discretely exact) solutions to the Poisson equation. By using an auxiliary algorithm for rapid evaluation of trigonometric transforms, the proportion of computation needed to solve the Poisson equation can be reduced to less than 25% of the total time needed to advance one time step. Computing on a UNIVAC 1108 machine, the flow can be advanced one time-step in 2 sec for a 14 times 14 times 14 grid upward to 96 sec for a 60 times 34 times 34 grid. As an example of the method, some features of a solution for steady wave flow in annulus convection are presented. The resemblance of this flow to the classical Eady wave is Optnoted.",

The solution technique consists in a Chebyshev orthogonal collocation method preconditioned by a standard Galerkin finite element technique. The preconditioned system is then solved through a Richardson procedure. The domain of interest is decomposed into quadrilaterals, curved when needed. A Gordon transfinite interpolation performs the curvilinear grid generation of the obtained simply-connected planar subdomains. The interface conditions, naturally incorporated into the finite element approach, relate neighbour subdomains through the normal jump of appropriate fluxes across internal boundaries, where an integral form ofC1 continuity is consequently achieved at convergence of the iterative processes. The study of model Stokes problems demonstrates that the current method still behaves spectrally in distorted geometries. For curvilinear distortion, a loss of several orders of magnitude is observed in the solution accuracy even when the distortion is very limited. Finally, some results of flow simulation in a constricted channel are proposed to illustrate the abilities of the present method to treat Navier-Stokes problems. ?? 1993 Academic Press, Inc.",

For $p=2$, we show that the full dual geometry is algebraically special Petrov type II.

Zhong, Derivation of high-order compact finite difference schemes for non-uniform grid using polynomial interpolation, J. Comput. Phys. 204 (2005) 404] for linear model equations are extended to the full Navier-Stokes equations in the vorticity and streamfunction formulation. Two methods for the solution of Helmholtz and Poisson equations using high-order compact schemes on non-uniform grids are developed. The schemes are constructed so that they maintain a high-order of accuracy not only in the interior but also at the boundary. Second-order semi-implicit temporal discretization is achieved through an implicit Backward Differentiation scheme for the linear viscous terms and an explicit Adam-Bashforth scheme for the non-linear convective terms. The boundary values of vorticity are determined using an influence matrix technique. The resulting discretized system with boundary closures of the same high-order as the interior is shown to be stable, when applied to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, provided enough grid points are clustered at the boundary. The resolution characteristics of the high-order compact finite difference schemes are illustrated through their application to the one-dimensional linear wave equation and the two-dimensional driven cavity flow. Comparisons with the benchmark solutions for the two-dimensional driven cavity flow, thermal convection in a square box and flow past an impulsively started cylinder show that the high-order compact schemes are stable and produce extremely accurate results on a stretched grid with more points clustered at the boundary. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "In this method we present a fractional step discretization of the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The method is based on a projection formulation in which we first solve diffusion-convection equations to predict intermediate velocities, which are then projected onto the space of divergence-free vector fields. Our treatment of the diffusion-convection step uses a specialized second-order upwind method for differencing the nonlinear convective terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms at a high Reynolds number. in contrast to conventional projection-type discretizations that impose a discrete form of the divergence-free constraint, we only approximately impose the constraint; i.e., the velocity held we compute is not exactly divergence-free. The approximate projection is computed using a conventional discretization of the Laplacian and the resulting linear system is solved using conventional multigrid methods. Numerical examples are presented to validate the second-order convergence of the method for Euler, finite Reynolds number, and Stokes now. A second example illustrating the behavior of the algorithm on an unstable shear layer is also presented.",

In particular, we consider the a posteriori error analysis and adaptive mesh design for the underlying discretization method. Indeed, by employing a duality argument (weighted) Type I a posteriori bounds are derived for the estimation of the error measured in terms of general target functionals of the solution; these error estimates involve the product of the finite element residuals with local weighting terms involving the solution of a certain dual problem that must be numerically approximated. This general approach leads to the design of economical finite element meshes specifically tailored to the computation of the tar-get functional of interest, as well as providing efficient error estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrating the performance of the proposed approach will be presented.",

          "abstract": "The Navier–Stokes formulation represents a uniquely challenging system of partial differential equations that continues to influence modern applied science and engineering. In its simplest form, the system can be used to prescribe the motion of a viscous incompressible fluid with constant properties. It consists of four equations in three-dimensional space that account for both the kinematic and dynamic conditions that a fluid element senses. In this work, we investigate the pressure integration rules and restrictions that affect the resolution of the scalar pressure field. We begin our analysis by exploring the integration properties of Euler&#039;s equations in two dimensions while making use of Clairaut&#039;s theorem on the commutativity of mixed partial derivatives. We then extend our findings to three-dimensional space. This process gives rise to a theorem and four corollaries that help to clarify the conditions needed to obtain exact or asymptotic solutions for the pressure distribution. Consequently, we identify the fundamental conditions under which the Navier–Stokes equations can be properly integrated to arrive at an analytic expression for the pressure field, namely, one that is continuous and twice differentiable. In closing, several configurations are used to test the theorem and showcase its connection with the pressure formulation. These include potential flows for which the pressure can be obtained unconditionally, and inviscid rotational motions of the Taylor–Culick type with and without headwall injection.",

Unlike in the finite-volume or finite-difference-based alternating-direction-implicit (ADI) methods, where factorization of the coordinate transformed governing equations is performed along generalized coordinate directions, in the proposed method, the discretized Cartesian form Navier-Stokes equations are factored along curvilinear grid lines. The new ADI finite-volume method is also extended for simulations on multi-block structured curvilinear grids with which complex geometries can be efficiently resolved. The numerical method is first developed for an unsteady convection-diffusion equation, then is extended for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The order of accuracy and stability characteristics of the present method are analyzed in simulations of an unsteady convection-diffusion problem, decaying vortices, flow in a lid-driven cavity, flow over a circular cylinder, and turbulent flow through a planar channel. Numerical solutions predicted by the proposed ADI finite-volume method are found to be in good agreement with experimental and other numerical data, while the solutions are obtained at much lower computational cost than those required by other iterative methods without factorization. For a simulation on a grid with O(105) cells, the computational time required by the present ADI-based method for a solution of momentum equations is found to be less than 20% of that required by a method employing a biconjugate-gradient-stabilized scheme. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

The discretizations include the following schemes for the inviscid fluxes: (1) second-order-accurate centered differences with third-order matrix numerical dissipation, (2) the second-order convective upstream split pressure scheme (CUSP), (3) third-order upwind-biased differencing with Roe’s flux-difference splitting, and (4) fourth-order centered differences with third-order matrix numerical dissipation. The first three are combined with second-order differencing for the grid metrics and viscous terms. The fourth discretization uses fourth-order differencing for the grid metrics and viscous terms, as well as higher-order approximations near boundaries and for the numerical integration used to calculate forces and moments. The results indicate that the discretization using higher-order approximations for all terms is substantially more accurate than the others, producing less than two percent numerical error in lift and drag components on grids with less than 13,000 nodes for subsonic cases and less than 18,000 nodes for transonic cases. Since the cost per grid node of all of the discretizations studied is comparable, the higher-order discretization produces solutions of a given accuracy much more efficiently than the others.",

I show that this result arises quite naturally when gravitational dynamics is viewed as an emergent phenomenon. Extremising the spacetime entropy density associated with the null surfaces leads to a set of equations which, when viewed in the local inertial frame, becomes identical to the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation. This is in contrast with the usual description of Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation in a general coordinate system, in which there appears a Lie derivative rather than convective derivative. I discuss this difference, its importance and why it is more appropriate to view the equation in a local inertial frame. The viscous force on fluid, arising from the gradient of the viscous stress-tensor, involves the second derivatives of the metric and does not vanish in the local inertial frame while the viscous stress-tensor itself vanishes so that inertial observers detect no dissipation. We thus provide an entropy extremisation principle that leads to the DNS equation, which makes the hydrodynamical analogy with gravity completely natural and obvious. Several implications of these results are discussed.",

We present a nonlinear PDE observer that estimates the velocity and pressure fields for an infinite channel flow.

Our observer consists of a copy of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations, combined with linear injection of output estimation error, with observer gains designed in closed form using backstepping. Pressure and skin friction at one of the walls are the only quantities needed for measurement. For a fully developed channel flow (whether laminar or turbulent), with a Reynolds number possibly above the critical value, but not too far above it, the observer is guaranteed to be convergent to the actual velocity and pressure field, provided its initial estimates are not too far from the actual initial profile. An output feedback result for the linearized infinite channel flow is also presented, combining the observer in this paper with a controller presented in a companion CDC&#039;05 paper. Both results are presented for the 2D case for clarity of exposition, however an extension to 3D is straightforward.",

The resulting Reduced Navier-Stokes (RNS) equations are defined on the boundary of the flow, and hence have reduced spatial dimensionality compared to the Navier-Stokes equations. This spatial reduction speeds up numerical computations and makes the equations attractive candidates for flow-control design. We prove that members of the RNS hierarchy are well-posed if appended with boundary-conditions obtained from wall-based sensors. We also derive the lowest-order RNS equations for three-dimensional flows. For several benchmark problems, our numerical simulations show close finite-time agreement between the solutions of RNS and those of the full Navier-Stokes equations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Similar to the lattice Boltzmann method, the mesh spacing is linked to the Mach number. An accuracy higher than that of the lattice Boltzmann method is achieved by exploiting the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the artificial compressibility equations for small Mach numbers and the simple lattice structure. An easy method for accelerating the decay of acoustic waves, which deteriorate the quality of the numerical solution, and a simple cure for the checkerboard instability are proposed.

          "abstract": "This paper presents an improved gas-kinetic scheme based on the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) model for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The current method extends the previous gas-kinetic Navier–Stokes solver developed by Xu and Prendergast (J. Comput. Phys.114, 9) by (a) implementing a general nonequilibrium state based on the Chapman–Enskog expansion of the BGK model as the initial gas distribution function at each time step, (b) using a different way in the construction of the equilibrium state at a cell interface, and (c) keeping two slopes of the macroscopic variables in the evaluation of spatial variations of the equilibrium state. As a result, the previous requirement of particle collision time τ being less than the time step Δt for the validity of the BGK Navier–Stokes solver is removed, and the scheme becomes more robust than the previous one. The current BGK method approximates the Navier–Stokes solutions accurately regardless of the ratio between the particle collision time and the numerical time step. The Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting Navier–Stokes (KFVS NS) solver developed by Chou and Baganoff comes to be the limiting case of the current method when the particle collision time is much larger than the time step. The Equilibrium Flux Method (EFM) of Pullin for the Euler equations is also a limiting case of the current method when the nonequilibrium part in the initial gas distribution function disappears and the collision time is much larger than the time step. The dissipative mechanism in the KFVS and many other FVS schemes is qualitatively analyzed from their relation with the BGK scheme. Also, in this paper, the appropriate implementation of boundary condition for the kinetic scheme, different limiting solutions, and the Prandtl number fix are presented. The connection among von Neumann and Richtmyer&#039;s artificial dissipation, Godunov method, and the gas-kinetic BGK scheme is discussed, from which the two concepts of dynamical and kinematical dissipation are introduced. The principles for constructing accurate and robust numerical schemes for the compressible flow simulation are proposed. Many numerical tests, which include highly nonequilibrium case (i.e., Mach 10 shock structure) are included to validate the BGK scheme for the viscous solutions and to support the physical and numerical analysis for different schemes.",

          "abstract": "The goal of this article is to study the boundary layer of wall bounded flows in a channel at small viscosity when the boundaries are uniformly noncharacteristic, i.e., there is injection and/or suction everywhere at the boundary. Following earlier work on the boundary layer for linearized Navier-Stokes equations in the case where the boundaries are characteristic (no-slip at the boundary and non-permeable), we consider here the case where the boundary is permeable and thus noncharacteristic. The form of the boundary layer and convergence results are derived in two cases: linearized equation and full nonlinear equations. We prove that there exists a boundary layer at the outlet (downwind) of the form e-Uz/[var epsilon] where U is the speed of injection/suction at the boundary, z is the distance to the outlet of the channel, and [var epsilon] is the kinematic viscosity. We improve an earlier result of S. N. Alekseenko (1994, Siberian Math. J.35, No. 2, 209-230) where the convergence in L2 of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to that of the Euler equations at vanishing viscosity was established. In the two dimensional case we are able to derive the physically relevant uniform in space (L[infinity] norm) estimates of the boundary layer. The uniform in space estimate is derived by properly developing our previous idea of better control on the tangential derivative and the use of an anisotropic Sobolev imbedding. To the best of our knowledge this is the first rigorously proved result concerning boundary layers for the full (nonlinear) Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids.",

For the Navier-Stokes equations, there exist no natural invariant regions for the equations with the real physical viscosity term so that the uniform sup-norm of solutions with respect to the physical viscosity coefficient may not be directly controllable and, furthermore, convex entropy-entropy flux pairs may not produce signed entropy dissipation measures. To overcome these difficulties, we first develop uniform energy-type estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficient for the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations and establish the existence of measure-valued solutions of the isentropic Euler equations generated by the Navier-Stokes equations. Based on the uniform energy-type estimates and the features of the isentropic Euler equations, we establish that the entropy dissipation measures of the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for weak entropy-entropy flux pairs, generated by compactly supported C 2 test functions, are confined in a compact set in H -1, which lead to the existence of measure-valued solutions that are confined by the Tartar-Murat commutator relation. A careful characterization of the unbounded support of the measure-valued solution confined by the commutator relation yields the reduction of the measure-valued solution to a Delta mass, which leads to the convergence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to a finite-energy entropy solution of the isentropic Euler equations.",

While this relieves the stiff source terms and potentially stabilizes the system, it introduces a much more complicated eigenstructure to the governing equations.

          "abstract": "We consider least-squares finite element models for the numerical solution of the non-stationary Navier-Stokes equations governing viscous incompressible fluid flows. The paper presents a formulation where the effects of space and time are coupled, resulting in a true space-time least-squares minimization procedure, as opposed to a space-time decoupled formulation where a least-squares minimization procedure is performed in space at each time step. The formulation is first presented for the linear advection-diffusion equation and then extended to the Navier-Stokes equations. The formulation has no time step stability restrictions and is spectrally accurate in both space and time. To allow the use of practical C0 element expansions in the resulting finite element model, the Navier-Stokes equations are expressed as an equivalent set of first-order equations by introducing vorticity as an additional independent variable and the least-squares method is used to develop the finite element model of the governing equations. High-order element expansions are used to construct the discrete model. The discrete model thus obtained is linearized by Newton&#039;s method, resulting in a linear system of equations with a symmetric positive definite coefficient matrix that is solved in a fully coupled manner by a preconditioned conjugate gradient method in matrix-free form. Spectral convergence of the L2 least-squares functional and L2 error norms in space-time is verified using a smooth solution to the two-dimensional non-stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical results are presented for impulsively started lid-driven cavity flow, oscillatory lid-driven cavity flow, transient flow over a backward-facing step, and flow around a circular cylinder; the results demonstrate the predictive capability and robustness of the proposed formulation. Even though the space-time coupled formulation is emphasized, we also present the formulation and numerical results for least-squares space-time decoupled finite element models. The numerical results show that the space-time coupled formulation has superior predictive capabilities for flows demanding high space-time resolution, exemplified here by the transient flow over a backward-facing step. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The Navier-Stokes equations for the primitive variables are considered and a generalized unsteady Stokes problem is derived, using an explicit time discretization of the nonlinear term. A split formulation of the linearized problem is then chosen by introducing a separate Poisson equation for the pressure supplemented by conditions of an integral character which assure that the incompressibility and the velocity boundary condition are simultaneously and exactly satisfied. After expanding the variables in convenient orthogonal bases, these integral conditions assume the form of one-dimensional integrals over the radial variable for the expansion coefficients of pressure, and are shown to involve the modified Bessel functions of half-odd order, in spherical coordinates, and of integer order, in the case of cylindrical regions with periodic boundary conditions along the axis. Such integral conditions represent the counterpart for pressure of the vorticity integral conditions introduced by Dennis for studying plane and axisymmetric flows and reduce the solution of the three-dimensional unsteady Stokes equations within spherical and cylindrical boundaries to a sequence of uncoupled second-order ordinary differential equations for only scalar unknowns. A Chebyshev spectral approximation is then considered to resolve the radial structure of the flow field. Numerical results are given to illustrate the convergence properties of the discrete equations obtained by the tau projection method. The problem of the efficient evaluation of the nonlinear term is not examined in the present paper. Finally, for the sake of completeness, the treatment of coordinate singularity in regions bounded by a single spherical or cylindrical surface is also discussed. ?? 1995.",

          "abstract": "The Navier-Stokes equations were firmly established in the 19th Century as the system of nonlinear partial differential equations which describe the motion of most commonly occurring fluids in air and water, and since that time exact solutions have been sought by scientists. Collectively these solutions allow a clear insight into the behavior of fluids, providing a vehicle for novel mathematical methods and a useful check for computations in fluid dynamics, a field in which theoretical research is now dominated by computational methods. This book draws together exact solutions from widely differing sources and presents them in a coherent manner, in part by classifying solutions via their temporal and geometric constraints. It will prove to be a valuable resource to all who have an interest in the subject of fluid mechanics, and in particular to those who are learning or teaching the subject at the senior undergraduate and graduate levels.",

The central topic of the study is the satisfaction of the boundary conditions in the presence of immersed bodies. To this aim, simple two-dimensional problems with steady forcing and sharp-edged surfaces are solved with a standard fractional step method. It is shown that the direct forcing scheme is not able to satisfy the impenetrability condition. This fact appears to be strictly related to the use of fractional step methods. A mathematically based explanation is given, suggesting that improvements can be obtained with the iterative solution of the irrotational part of the flow, when spectral methods are used and local modification of the discrete differential operators are difficult to be implemented. The results are then verified in two-dimensional unsteady problems and three-dimensional flows with moving smooth boundaries. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In particular the second-order Gear scheme is susceptible to this instability, as well as the second-order Adams-Bashforth and Runge-Kutta schemes. In its simplest form, the instability introduces slowly growing, divergence-free perturbations to the velocity field. This &#039;weakly unstable&#039; behaviour, whilst known theoretically, can remain concealed in practical simulations and can thus be under-rated. This paper demonstrates the relevance of the instability and highlights the requirement of higher order in an explicit temporal scheme, in order to reduce the affects. In response to this requirement a third-order scheme is developed, that is similar in concept to the second-order Gear scheme. The benefits of this temporal scheme are demonstrated both in reference to numerical stability, and also in relation to dissipation in a co-located spatial scheme. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A key feature of this method is a cut-cell meshing technique, in which the triangles are not required to conform to the boundary. This approach permits anisotropic adaptation without the difficulty of constructing meshes that conform to potentially complex geometries. A quadrature technique is proposed for accurately integrating on general cut cells. In addition, an output-based error estimator and adaptive method are presented, appropriately accounting for high-order solution spaces in optimizing local mesh anisotropy. Accuracy on cut-cell meshes is demonstrated by comparing solutions to those on standard, boundary-conforming meshes. Robustness of the cut-cell and adaptation technique is successfully tested for highly anisotropic boundary-layer meshes representative of practical high Re simulations. Furthermore, adaptation results show that, for all test cases considered, p = 2 and p = 3 discretizations meet desired error tolerances using fewer degrees of freedom than p = 1. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this article is twofold. First, we adapt the construction of [J.-Y. Chemin, I. Gallagher, On the global wellposedness of the 3-D Navier-Stokes equations with large initial data, Annales Scientifiques de l&#039;École Normale Supérieure de Paris, in press] to the case of the whole space: we prove that if a certain nonlinear function of the initial data is small enough, in a Koch-Tataru [H.

We provide an example of initial data satisfying that nonlinear smallness condition, but whose norm is arbitrarily large in C-1. Then we prove a stability result on the nonlinear smallness assumption. More precisely we show that the new smallness assumption also holds for linear superpositions of translated and dilated iterates of the initial data, in the spirit of a construction in [H.

This model shares many properties of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. One of the main results of this paper is that we prove rigorously the finite time singularity formation of the 3D inviscid model for a class of initial boundary value problems with smooth initial data of finite energy.

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust and efficient numerical method for the simulation of low Mach number flows in which the poorly distributed eigenvalues usually result in the numerical difficulties. The method takes advantage of the pressure-based and the density-based methods. It thus accelerates the numerical convergence by adjusting the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. In order to control the numerical instability and the spurious wave reflections at the numerical boundaries, a characteristic boundary condition is formulated. This numerical method as well as the boundary condition treatment extend the traditional fractional step method to the simulation of compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The performance and the accuracy of the method to calculate the flows with large amplitude of acoustic waves and strong heat transfer have been demonstrated by the direct numerical simulation of three distinct cases: a one-dimensional Euler equation with large amplitude of acoustic waves, an adiabatic turbulent boundary layer, and a turbulent boundary layer with heated wall. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The method relies on the artificial compressibility formulation, which endows the governing equations a hyperbolic-parabolic nature. The convective terms are discretized with a third-order upwind compact scheme based on flux-difference splitting, and the viscous terms are approximated with a fourth-order central compact scheme. Dual-time stepping is implemented for time-accurate calculation in conjunction with Beam-Warming approximate factorization scheme. The present compact scheme is compared with an established non-compact scheme via analysis in a model equation and numerical tests in four benchmark flow problems. Comparisons demonstrate that the present third-order upwind compact scheme is more accurate than the non-compact scheme while having the same computational cost as the latter. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The derivation of equations follows a three-step method recently developed for the PML of linearized Euler equations. To increase the efficiency of the PML, a pseudo mean flow is introduced in the formulation of absorption equations. The proposed PML equations will absorb exponentially the difference between the nonlinear fluctuation and the prescribed pseudo mean flow. With the nonlinearity in flux vectors, the proposed nonlinear absorbing equations are not formally perfectly matched to the governing equations as their linear counter-parts are. However, numerical examples show satisfactory results. Furthermore, the nonlinear PML reduces automatically to the linear PML upon linearization about the pseudo mean flow. The validity and efficiency of proposed equations as absorbing boundary conditions for nonlinear Euler and Navier–Stokes equations are demonstrated by numerical examples.",

Linearized simulations at a much higher Reynolds number, more relevant to aerospace applications, produce results that show no marked differences to those obtained at low Reynolds number. It is also observed that there is a close correlation between DNS data of drag reduction and a very simple characteristic of the ‘generalized’ Stokes layer generated by the streamwise-travelling waves.",

By introducing more coupling between the diffusion&lt;onvection step and the projection step we obtain a temporal discretiza- tion that is second-order accurate. Our treatment of the diffusion-convection step uses a specialized higher order Godunov method for differencing the nonlinear convective terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms at high Reynolds number. The Godunov procedure is second-order accurate for smooth flow and remains stable for discontinuous initial data, even in the zero-viscosity limit. We approximate the projection directly using a Galerkin procedure that uses a local basis for discretely divergence-free vector fields.

In each time step a set of systems of linear equations has to be solved. The size of the time steps is restricted by stability and accuracy of the time-stepping scheme, and convergence of the iterative methods for the solution of the systems of equations. The stability is investigated with a linear model equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations on Cartesian grids. The resolution in space and time is estimated from turbulent flow physics. The convergence of the iterative solvers is discussed with respect to the time steps. The stability constraints obtained from the model equation are compared to results for a semi-explicit integrator of the Navier-Stokes equations with good agreement.

The main difficulty in developing this moving mesh scheme is how to keep it divergence-free for the velocity field at each time level. The proposed numerical scheme extends a recent moving grid method based on harmonic mapping R. Li, T. Tang, and P. W. Zhang, J. Comput. Phys., 170 2001), pp. 562-588, which decouples the PDE solver and the mesh-moving algorithm. This approach requires interpolating the solution on the newly generated mesh. Designing a divergence-free-preserving interpolation algorithm is the first goal of this work. Selecting suitable monitor functions is important and is found challenging for the incompressible flow simulations, which is the second goal of this study. The performance of the moving mesh scheme is tested on the standard periodic double shear layer problem. No spurious vorticity patterns appear when even fairly coarse grids are used.",

Imposing the natural boundary conditions of the Laplace form or neglecting the viscous contributions on free surfaces are traditionally considered reasonable and harmless assumptions. With these boundary conditions any formulation derived from integral methods (like finite elements or finite volumes) recovers the pure Laplacian aspect of the strong form of the equations. This approach has also the advantage of being convenient in terms of computational effort and, as a consequence, it is used extensively. However, we have recently discovered that these resulting Laplacian formulations violate a basic axiom of continuum mechanics: the principle of objectivity. In the present article we give an accurate account about these topics. We also show that unexpected differences may sometimes arise between Laplace discretizations and divergence discretizations.",

The second is a class of non-similarity solutions obtained by continuation and mapping of the classical solution to steady advection-diffusion around a finite circular absorber in a two-dimensional potential flow, resulting in more complicated vortex structures that we describe as avenues, fishbones, wheels, eyes and butterflies. These solutions exhibit a transition from &#039;clouds&#039; to &#039;wakes&#039; of vorticity in the transverse flow with increasing Reynolds number. Our solutions provide useful test cases for numerical simulations, and some may be observable in experiments, although we expect instabilities at high Reynolds number.

Convection-diffusion splitting allows appropriate methods to be applied separately to the convective and diffusive parts of the Navier-Stokes equations and can significantly reduce the cost of simulating viscous flows, since the convective solver is no longer bound by viscous time-step restrictions. We describe an uncoupled approach for the solution of the diffusion equations, where a direct, low storage implicit solution is possible with only scalar tridiagonal matrix inversionsc.

This approach has been studied for the Stokes problem in (Weak imposition of boundary conditions in the Stokes problem, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Pittsburgh, PA, 1999). In most flows the Reynolds number is not negligible so the u·∇u inertial effects are important. Thus the extension beyond the Stokes problem to the Navier-Stokes equations is critical. We show existence and uniqueness of the approximate solution and optimal order of convergence can be achieved if the computational mesh follows the real boundary.

Unlike in the finite-volume or finite-difference-based alternating-direction-implicit (ADI) methods, where factorization of the coordinate transformed governing equations is performed along generalized coordinate directions, in the proposed method, the discretized Cartesian form Navier-Stokes equations are factored along curvilinear grid lines. The new ADI finite-volume method is also extended for simulations on multi-block structured curvilinear grids with which complex geometries can be efficiently resolved. The numerical method is first developed for an unsteady convection-diffusion equation, then is extended for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The order of accuracy and stability characteristics of the present method are analyzed in simulations of an unsteady convection-diffusion problem, decaying vortices, flow in a lid-driven cavity, flow over a circular cylinder, and turbulent flow through a planar channel. Numerical solutions predicted by the proposed ADI finite-volume method are found to be in good agreement with experimental and other numerical data, while the solutions are obtained at much lower computational cost than those required by other iterative methods without factorization. For a simulation on a grid with O(10(5)) cells, the computational time required by the present ADI-based method for a solution of momentum equations is found to be less than 20% of that required by a method employing a biconjugate-gradient-stabilized scheme.

Numerical dissipation operators based on the Roe scheme, a matrix dissipation, and the CUSP scheme are considered in evaluating the RK/implicit scheme. In addition, the effect of the number of RK stages is examined. Both the numerical and computational efficiency of the scheme with the different dissipation operators are discussed. The RK/implicit scheme is used to solve the two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) compressible, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations.

          "abstract": "Brenner has recently proposed modifications to the Navier-Stokes equations that are based on theoretical arguments but supported only by experiments having a fairly limited range. These modifications relate to a diffusion of fluid volume that would be significant for flows with high density gradients. So the viscous structure of shock waves in gases should provide an excellent test case for this new model. In this paper we detail the shock structure problem and propose exponents for the gas viscosity-temperature relation based on empirical viscosity data that is independent of shock experiments. We then simulate shocks in the range Mach 1.0-12.0 using the Navier-Stokes equations, both with and without Brenner&#039;s modifications. Initial simulations showed Brenner&#039;s modifications display unphysical behaviour when the coefficient of volume diffusion exceeds the kinematic viscosity. Our subsequent analyses attribute this behaviour to both an instability to temporal disturbances and a spurious phase velocity-frequency relationship. On equating the volume diffusivity to the kinematic viscosity, however, we find the results with Brenner&#039;s modifications are significantly better than those of the standard Navier-Stokes equations, and broadly similar to those from the family of extended hydrodynamic models that includes the Burnett equations. Brenner&#039;s modifications add only two terms to the Navier-Stokes equations, and the numerical implementation is much simpler than conventional extended hydrodynamic models, particularly in respect of boundary conditions. We recommend further investigation and testing on a number of different benchmark non-equilibrium flow cases.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a new multiscale finite element method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed method arises from a decomposition of the velocity field into coarse/resolved scales and fine/unresolved scales. Modeling of the unresolved scales corrects the lack of stability of the standard Galerkin formulation and yields a method that possesses superior properties like that of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method and the Galerkin/least-squares (GLS) method. The multiscale method allows arbitrary combinations of interpolation functions for the velocity and the pressure fields, specifically the equal order interpolations that are easy to implement but violate the celebrated Babuska-Brezzi condition. A significant feature of the present method is that the structure of the stabilization tensor ?? appears naturally via the solution of the fine-scale problem. A family of 2-D elements comprising 3 and 6 node triangles and 4 and 9 node quadrilaterals has been developed. Convergence studies for the method on uniform, skewed as well as composite meshes are presented. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear steady and transient flow problems are shown that exhibit the good stability and accuracy properties of the method. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "The immersed boundary method is one of the most useful computational methods in studying fluid structure interaction. On the other hand, the Immersed Boundary method is also known to require small time steps to maintain stability when solved with an explicit method. Many implicit or approximately implicit methods have been proposed in the literature to remove this severe time step stability constraint, but none of them give satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient semi-implicit scheme to remove this stiffness from the immersed boundary method for the Navier-Stokes equations. The construction of our semi-implicit scheme consists of two steps. First, we obtain a semi-implicit discretization which is proved to be unconditionally stable. This unconditionally stable semi-implicit scheme is still quite expensive to implement in practice. Next, we apply the small scale decomposition to the unconditionally stable semi-implicit scheme to construct our efficient semi-implicit scheme. Unlike other implicit or semi-implicit schemes proposed in the literature, our semi-implicit scheme can be solved explicitly in the spectral space. Thus the computational cost of our semi-implicit schemes is comparable to that of an explicit scheme. Our extensive numerical experiments show that our semi-implicit scheme has much better stability property than an explicit scheme. This offers a substantial computational saving in using the immersed boundary method. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In this paper a detailed comparison of the Navier–Stokes calculation with the various non-parallel theories is provided.

We use pressure Poisson equation (PPE) formulation and propose new boundary conditions for the pressure on the open or traction boundaries. After replacing the divergence free constraint by this pressure Poisson equation, we obtain an unconstrained NSE. For Stokes equation with open boundary condition on a simple domain, we prove unconditional stability of a first order semi-implicit scheme where the pressure is treated explicitly and hence is decoupled from the computation of velocity. Using either boundary condition, the schemes for the full NSE that treat both convection and pressure terms explicitly work well with various spatial discretizations including spectral collocation and C0 finite elements. Moreover, when Reynolds number is of O (1) and when the first order semi-implicit time stepping is used, time step size of O (1) is allowed in benchmark computations for the full NSE. Besides standard stability and accuracy check, various numerical results including flow over a backward facing step, flow past a cylinder and flow in a bifurcated tube are reported. Numerically we have observed that using PPE formulation enables us to use the velocity/pressure pairs that do not satisfy the standard inf-sup compatibility condition.

The approach considered here uses an embedded geometry representation of the objects and approximate the governing equations with a low numerical dissipation centered finite-difference discretization. The method is suitable for compressible flows without shocks and can be classified as an immersed interface method. The objects are sharply captured by the Cartesian mesh by appropriately adapting the discretization stencils around the irregular grid nodes, located around the boundary. In contrast with available methods, no jump conditions are used or explicitly derived from the boundary conditions, although a number of elements are adopted from previous immersed interface approaches. A new element in the present approach is the use of the summation-by-parts formalism to develop stable non-stiff first-order derivative approximations at the irregular grid points. Second-order derivative approximations, as those appearing in the transport terms, can be stiff when irregular grid points are located too close to the boundary. This is addressed using a semi-implicit time integration method. Moreover, it is shown that the resulting implicit equations can be solved explicitly in the case of constant transport properties. Convergence studies are performed for a rotating cylinder and vortex shedding behind objects of varying shapes at different Mach and Reynolds numbers. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.",

Existence and smoothness of solution for the Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions have been known for a long time. Leray showed that the Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensional space have a weak solution. Scheffer, and Shnirelman, obtained weak solution of the Euler equations with compact support in spacetime. Caffarelli, Kohn and Nirenberg improved Scheffer&#039;s results, and F.-H. Lin simplified the proof of the results of J. Leray. Many problems and conjectures about behavior of weak solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are described in the books of Ladyzhenskaya, Bertozzi and Majda, Temam, Constantin or Lemari\&#039;e-Rieusset.   Solutions of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations with initial conditions (Cauchy problem) for 2D and 3D cases were obtained in the converging series form by analytical iterative method using Fourier and Laplace transforms in a paper by Tsionskiy. These solutions were received as infinitely differentiable functions. That allowed us to analyze essential aspects of the problem on a much deeper level and with more details. For several combinations of problem parameters numerical results were obtained and presented as graphs by Tsionskiy.   This paper describes detailed proof of existence and uniqueness of the solution of the Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with any smooth initial velocity. This solution satisfies the conditions required in Fefferman for the problem of Navier-Stokes equations. When viscosity tends to zero this proof is correct for the Euler equations also.",

We then consider Galerkin approximations, and show that it if a strong solution exists the Galerkin approximations will converge to it; thus if one is prepared to assume that the Navier-Stokes equations are regular one can justify this particular numerical method rigorously. Combining these two results we show that if a strong solution of the exact problem exists then this can be verified numerically using an algorithm that can be guaranteed to terminate in a finite time. We thus introduce the possibility of rigorous computations of the solutions of the 3d Navier-Stokes equations (despite the lack of rigorous existence and uniqueness results), and demonstrate that numerical investigation can be used to rule out the occurrence of possible singularities in particular examples.",

The aim of such a technique is to compute a low-cost reduced basis approximation of the full stochastic Galerkin solution of the problem at hand. A particular algorithm, inspired by the Arnoldi method for solving eigenproblems, is proposed for an efficient greedy construction of a deterministic reduced basis approximation. This algorithm decouples the computation of the deterministic and stochastic components of the solution, thus allowing reuse of preexisting deterministic Navier--Stokes solvers. It has the remarkable property of only requiring the solution of $m$ uncoupled deterministic problems for the construction of an $m$-dimensional reduced basis rather than $M$ coupled problems of the full stochastic Galerkin approximation space, with $m \ll M$ (up to one order of magnitude for the problem at hand in this work).",

Setting beta equal to alpha reduces the Navier-Stokes alphabeta equations to the Navier-Stokes alpha equations.

For the Navier-Stokes alphabeta equations, Kolmogorov&#039;s -5/3 law is also recovered.

The fluxes are limited by either a Superbee or MinMod limiter. Solution reconstruction within the tetrahedral cells is accomplished with a simple, but novel, multidimensional analytical formula.

Three forms of the nonlinear correction for staggered grids are proposed and studied. The accuracy of each approximation is assessed comparatively in Fourier space. The importance of higher-order approximations of pressure is discussed and numerically demonstrated. Fourth-order accuracy of the complete scheme is illustrated by the doubly-periodic shear layer and the instability of plane-channel flow. The efficiency of the scheme is demonstrated by a grid dependency study of turbulent channel flows by means of direct numerical simulations. The proposed scheme is highly accurate and efficient. At the same level of accuracy, the fourth-order scheme can be ten times faster than the second-order counterpart.

The new scheme is based on the recently introduced accelerated FC method, which enables use of highly accurate Fourier expansions as the main building block of general-domain PDE solvers. Previous FC-based PDE solvers are restricted to linear scalar equations with constant coefficients. The FC methodology presented in this text thus constitutes a significant generalization of the previous FC schemes, as it yields general-domain FC solvers for nonlinear systems of PDEs. While not restricted to periodic boundary conditions and therefore applicable to general boundary value problems on arbitrary domains, the proposed algorithm inherits many of the highly desirable properties arising from rapidly convergent Fourier expansions, including high-order convergence, essentially spectrally accurate dispersion relations, and much milder CFL constraints than those imposed by polynomial-based spectral methods-since, for example, the spectral radius of the FC first derivative grows linearly with the number of spatial discretization points. We demonstrate the accuracy and optimal parallel efficiency of the algorithm in a variety of scientific and engineering contexts relevant to fluid-dynamics and nonlinear acoustics. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

International Journal of Numerical Methods in Engineering 1998; 41: 1131-1151), the authors proposed an efficient method of solving the Navier-Stokes equations by reducing their number of modes. Employing the empirical eigenfunctions of the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition as basis functions of a Galerkin procedure, one can a priori limit the function space considered to the smallest linear sub-space that is sufficient to describe the observed phenomena, and consequently, reduce the Navier-Stokes equations defined on a complicated geometry to a set of ordinary differential equations with a minimum degree of freedom. In the present work, we apply this technique, termed the Karhunen-Loeve Galerkin procedure, to a pointwise control problem of Navier-Stokes equations. The Karhunen-Loeve Galerkin procedure is found to be much more efficient than the traditional method, such as finite difference method in obtaining optimal control profiles when the minimization of the objective function has been done by using a conjugate gradient method.

A special case is that of high pressure flow of real gases in cooling channels where large crosswise gradients of thermophysical properties occur. To solve the parabolized Navier-Stokes equations by a space marching approach, the hyperbolicity of the system of governing equations is obtained, even for very low Mach number flow, by recasting equations such that the streamwise pressure gradient is considered as a source term. For this system of equations an approximate Roe&#039;s Riemann solver is developed as the core of a Godunov type finite volume algorithm. The properties of the approximated Riemann solver, which is a modification of Roe&#039;s Riemann solver for the parabolized Navier-Stokes equations, are presented and discussed with emphasis given to its original features introduced to handle fluids governed by a generic real gas EoS. Sample solutions are obtained for low Mach number high compressible flows of transcritical methane, heated in straight long channels, to prove the solver ability to describe flows dominated by complex thermodynamic phenomena. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

We review some re- cent theoretical and computational studies which show that there is a subtle dynamic depletion of nonlinear vortex stretching due to local geometric regu- larity of vortex filaments. We also investigate the dynamic stability of the 3D Navier–Stokes equations and the stabilizing effect of convection. A unique feature of our approach is the interplay between computation and analysis. Guided by our local non-blow-up theory, we have performed large-scale com- putations of the 3D Euler equations using a novel pseudo-spectral method on some of the most promising blow-up candidates. Our results show that there is tremendous dynamic depletion of vortex stretching. Moreover, we observe that the support of maximum vorticity becomes severely flattened as the maximum vorticity increases and the direction of the vortex filaments near the support of maximum vorticity is very regular. Our numerical ob- servations in turn provide valuable insight, which leads to further theoretical breakthrough. Finally, we present a new class of solutions for the 3D Euler and Navier–Stokes equations, which exhibit very interesting dynamic growth properties. By exploiting the special nonlinear structure of the equations, we prove nonlinear stability and the global regularity of this class of solutions.",

The viscosity is treated implicitly through a finite volume approach based on Voronoi partitions, while the convective term is discretized with a semi-Lagrangian scheme, thus relaxing the restrictions on the time step. A novel stable implementation of the projection step is introduced, making use of the Marker And Cell layout for the data. The solver is validated numerically in two and three spatial dimensions.",

The scheme is fourth-order accurate in space and uses the momentum equations for the velocity coupled to a Poisson equation for the pressure. The boundary condition for the pressure is taken as ∇ • u = 0. Extra numerical boundary conditions are chosen to make the scheme accurate and stable. The velocity is advanced explicitly in time; any standard time stepping scheme such as Runge-Kutta can be used. The Poisson equation is solved using direct or iterative sparse matrix solvers or by the multigrid algorithm. Computational results in two and three space dimensions are given.",

It is shown that Leray&#039;s weak solutions of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations can have this binary character in time. An estimate is given for the widths of the short, active time intervals, which decreases with the Reynolds number. In these &#039;bad&#039;. intervals singularities are still possible. However, the average width of a &#039;good&#039; interval, where no singularities are possible, increases with the Reynolds number relative to the average width of a bad interval.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the derivation of Euler’s equation from Hamilton’s variational principle for flows decomposed into their mean and fluctuating parts. Our particular concern is with the flow decomposition used in the derivation of the Navier–Stokes–$\alpha$ equation which expresses the fluctuating velocity in terms of the mean flow and a small fluctuating displacement. In the past the derivation has retained terms up to second order in the Lagrangian which is then averaged. The variation is effected by incrementing the mean velocity, while holding the moments of the products of the displacements fixed. The process leads to a mean Euler equation for the mean velocity. The Navier–Stokes–$\alpha$ equation is only obtained after making a further closure approximation, which is not the concern of this paper. Instead attention is restricted here to the exact analysis of Euler’s equation. We show that a proper implementation of Hamilton’s principle, which concerns the virtual variation of particle paths, can only be achieved when the fluctuating displacement and mean velocity are varied in concert. This leads to an exact form of Euler’s equation. If, on the other hand, the displacement is held fixed under the variation, a term in Euler’s equation is lost. Averaging that erroneous form provides the basis of the Navier–Stokes–$\alpha$ equation. We explore the implications of the correct mean equation, particularly with regard to Kelvin’s circulation theorem, comparing it with the so called GLM and glm-equations.",

          "abstract": "This paper considers the accuracy of projection method approximations to the initial–boundary-value problem for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The issue of how to correctly specify numerical boundary conditions for these methods has been outstanding since the birth of the second-order methodology a decade and a half ago. It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary conditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connection between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail.",

The two-level algorithm consists of solving a small nonlinear system of equations on the coarse mesh and then using that solution to solve a larger linear system on the fine mesh. The two-level method exploits the quadratic nonlinearity in the Navier-Stokes equations.

In analogy with the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence, we define a small spatial scale, \ell_{\epsilon}, as the scale at which the balance occurs in the mean rates of nonlinear transport of energy and viscous dissipation of energy. Furthermore, we show that the number of degrees of freedom in the long-time behavior of the solutions to these equations is bounded from above by (L/\ell_{epsilon})^3, where L is a typical large spatial scale (e.g., the size of the domain). This estimate suggests that the Landau-Lifshitz classical theory of turbulence is suitable for interpreting the solutions of the NS-alpha equations. Hence, one may consider these equations as a closure model for the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). We study this approach, further, in other related papers. Finally, we discuss the relation of the NS-alpha model to the NSE by proving a convergence theorem, that as the length scale alpha tends to zero a subsequence of solutions of the NS-alpha equations converges to a weak solution of the three dimensional NSE.",

The purpose of this paper is to study a low order simulation of the Navier–Stokes equations on the basis of the evolution of such coherent structures. One way to extract some basis functions which can be interpreted as coherent structures from flow simulations is by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Then, by means of a Galerkin projection, it is possible to find the system of ODEs which approximates the problem in the finite-dimensional space spanned by the POD basis functions. It is found that low order modeling of relatively complex flow simulations, such as laminar vortex shedding from an airfoil at incidence and turbulent vortex shedding from a square cylinder, provides good qualitative results compared with reference computations. In this respect, it is shown that the accuracy of numerical schemes based on simple Galerkin projection is insufficient and numerical stabilization is needed. To conclude, we approach the issue of the optimal selection of the norm, namely the H 1 norm, used in POD for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations by several numerical tests.",

By introducing more coupling between the diffusion-convection step and the projection step we obtain a temporal discretization that is second-order accurate. Our treatment of the diffusion-convection step uses a specialized higher order Godunov method for differencing the nonlinear convective terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms at high Reynolds number. The Godunov procedure is second-order accurate for smooth flow and remains stable for discontinuous initial data, even in the zero-viscosity limit. We approximate the projection directly using a Galerkin procedure that uses a local basis for discretely divergence-free vector fields. Numerical results are presented validating the convergence properties of the method. We also apply the method to doubly periodic shear-layers to assess the performance of the method on more difficult applications. ?? 1989.",

Including viscous stresses into finite difference, finite element, or spectral element models poses no additional challenges; however, including these terms to either finite volume or discontinuous Galerkin models requires the introduction of additional machinery because these methods were originally designed for first-order operators. We use the local discontinuous Galerkin method to overcome this obstacle. The seven test cases show that all of our models yield good results. The main conclusion is that equation set 1 (non-conservation form) does not perform as well as sets 2 and 3 (conservation forms). For the density current (viscous), the SE and DG models using set 3 (mass and total energy) give less dissipative results than the other equation sets; based on these results we recommend set 3 for the development of future multiscale research codes. In addition, the fact that set 3 conserves both mass and energy up to machine precision motives us to pursue this equation set for the development of future mesoscale models. For the bubble and mountain tests, the DG models performed better. Based on these results and due to its conservation properties we recommend the DG method. In the worst case scenario, the DG models are 50% slower than the non-conservative SE models. In the best case scenario, the DG models are just as efficient as the conservative SE models.",

An initial multiblock structured mesh is first fit with B-spline volumes that form the basis for a hybrid mesh movement scheme that is tightly integrated with the geometry parameterization based on B-spline surfaces. The RANS equations and the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model are solved in a fully coupled manner using an efficient parallel Newton–Krylov algorithm with approximate-Schur preconditioning. Gradient evaluations are performed using the discrete-adjoint approach with analytical differentiation of the discrete flow and mesh movement equations. The overall methodology remains robust even in the presence of large shape changes. Several examples of lift-constrained drag minimization are provided, including a study of the common research model wing geometry, a wing–body–tail geometry with a prescribed spanwise load distribution, and a blended-wing–body configuration. An example is provided that demonstrates that a wing optimized based on the Euler equations exhibits substantially inferior performance when subsequently analyzed based on the RANS equations relative to a wing optimized based on the RANS equations Read More: http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.J053457",

We solve the steady state equations by advancing in time using a backward Euler (BE) scheme. To avoid the inversion of a large matrix we approximate BE by an implicit lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) algorithm. The implicit method addresses the stiffness in the discrete Navier-Stokes equations associated with stretched meshes. The LU-SGS algorithm is then used as a smoother for a p-multigrid approach. A Von Neumann stability analysis is applied to the two-dimensional linear advection equation to determine its damping properties. The implicit LU-SGS scheme is used to solve the two-dimensional (2D) compressible laminar Navier-Stokes equations. We compute the solution of a laminar external flow over a cylinder and around an airfoil at low Mach number. We compare the convergence rates with explicit Runge-Kutta (E-RK) schemes employed as a smoother. The effects of the cell aspect ratio and the low Mach number on the convergence are investigated. With the p-multigrid method and the implicit smoother the computational time can be reduced by a factor of up to 5-10 compared with a well tuned E-RK scheme. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A sensible comparison is made with a standard second-order (in time and space) finite difference scheme based on a stream function-vorticity formulation and with available experimental data. The numerical results indicate that both schemes produce very reliable results and that despite the singular boundary condition, the spectral-projection scheme is still more accurate (in terms of a fixed number of unknowns) and more efficient (in terms of CPU time required for resolving the flow at a fixed Reynolds number to within a prescribed accuracy) than the finite difference scheme.

          "abstract": "We present an implicit high-order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the steady-state and time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The method is devised by using the discontinuous Galerkin discretization for a velocity gradient-pressure-velocity formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a special choice of the numerical traces. The method possesses several unique features which distinguish itself from other discontinuous Galerkin methods. First, it reduces the globally coupled unknowns to the approximate trace of the velocity and the mean of the pressure on element boundaries, thereby leading to a significant reduction in the degrees of freedom. Moreover, if the augmented Lagrangian method is used to solve the linearized system, the globally coupled unknowns become the approximate trace of the velocity only. Second, it provides, for smooth viscous-dominated problems, approximations of the velocity, pressure, and velocity gradient which converge with the optimal order of k+1 in the L2-norm, when polynomials of degree k≥0 are used for all components of the approximate solution. And third, it displays superconvergence properties that allow us to use the above-mentioned optimal convergence properties to define an element-by-element postprocessing scheme to compute a new and better approximate velocity. Indeed, this new approximation is exactly divergence-free, H(div)-conforming, and converges with order k+2 for k≥1 and with order 1 for k=0 in the L2-norm. Moreover, a novel and systematic way is proposed for imposing boundary conditions for the stress, viscous stress, vorticity and pressure which are not naturally associated with the weak formulation of the method. This can be done on different parts of the boundary and does not result in the degradation of the optimal order of convergence properties of the method. Extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy properties of the method for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and for various polynomial degrees. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

A new derivation of the algorithm in a general setting is provided, showing in what sense it can also be understood as a fractional-step method; this justifies, in particular, why the original boundary conditions of the problem can be enforced in this algorithm. Two different finite element interpolations are considered for the space discretization, and numerical results obtained with them for standard benchmark cases are presented",

Therefore, the computational efficiency of implicit flow solvers becomes critically important. The textbook multigrid efficiency (TME), which is the optimal efficiency of a multigrid method, is achieved if accurate solutions of the governing equations are obtained with the total computational work that is a small (less than 10) multiple of the operation count in one residual evaluation. In this paper, we present a TME solver for unsteady subsonic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions discretized with an implicit, second-order accurate in both space and time, unconditionally stable, and non-conservative scheme. A semi-Lagrangian approach is used to discretize the time-dependent convection part of the equations; viscous terms and the pressure gradient are discretized on a staggered grid. The TME solver for the implicit equations is applied at each time level. The computational efficiency of the solver is designed to be independent of the Reynolds number. Our tests show that the proposed solver maintains its optimal efficiency at high Reynolds numbers and for large time steps. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.",

The crucial point of the method is the requirement that the continuity equation be satisfied everywhere in the domain, on the boundaries as well as in the interior. The key feature of the work presented in this paper is that the computer storage requirements of the full matrix inversion resulting from direct solution of the pressure Poisson equation in three dimensions is greatly reduced by considering an eigenfunction decomposition. The method was tested on a two-dimensional driven cavity flow and the results were compared with those of the most accurate finite-difference calculation. The three-dimensional driven cavity flow was then calculated at the same Reynolds numbers as the two-dimensional cases, i.e., Re = 100, 400, and 1000. In the calculated results, three-dimensional boundary effects were observed in all cases and became more apparent with increasing Reynolds number. ?? 1987.",

Discretization of these equations leads to a system of linear equations in n-unknowns which is solved by an iterative technique and the method converges rapidly giving satisfactory results. For the pressure variable we consider a pressure Poisson equation with suitable Neumann type boundary conditions. In case of velocity-vorticity formulation similar procedure is used, for a collocated grid.

A high order sliding mesh method is developed and implemented for flow simulation with relative rotational motion of an inner mesh with respect to an outer static mesh, through the use of curved boundary elements and mixed triangular-quadrilateral meshes.A second order stiffly stable method is used to discretise in time the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Spatial discretisation is provided by the Symmetric Interior Penalty Galerkin formulation with modal basis functions in the x-y plane, allowing hanging nodes and sliding meshes without the requirement to use mortar type techniques. Spatial discretisation in the z-direction is provided by a purely spectral method that uses Fourier series and allows computation of spanwise periodic three-dimensional flows. The developed solver is shown to provide high order solutions, second order in time convergence rates and spectral convergence when solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on meshes where fixed and rotating elements coexist. In addition, an exact implementation of the no-slip boundary condition is included for curved edges; circular arcs and NACA 4-digit airfoils, where analytic expressions for the geometry are used to compute the required metrics. The solver capabilities are tested for a number of two dimensional problems governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on static and rotating meshes: the Taylor vortex problem, a static and rotating symmetric NACA0015 airfoil and flows through three bladed cross-flow turbines. In addition, three dimensional flow solutions are demonstrated for a three bladed cross-flow turbine and a circular cylinder shadowed by a pitching NACA0012 airfoil. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

We examine several preconditioners for the consistent L-2 Poisson operator arising in the P-N - PN-2 spectral element formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We develop a finite element-based additive Schwarz preconditioner using overlapping subdomains plus a coarse grid projection operator which is applied directly to the pressure on the interior Gauss points.

After rederiving the theory using a local argument with the entropy current, we show that this theory universally reduces to the standard relativistic Navier-Stokes fluid mechanics in the long time limit. Since effects of elasticity are taken into account, the dynamics at short time scales is modified from that given by the Navier-Stokes equations, so that acausal problems intrinsic to relativistic Navier-Stokes fluids are significantly remedied. We in particular show that the wave equations for the propagation of disturbance around a hydrostatic equilibrium in Minkowski spacetime become symmetric hyperbolic for some range of parameters, so that the model is free of acausality problems. This observation suggests that the relativistic viscoelastic model with such parameters can be regarded as a causal completion of relativistic Navier-Stokes fluid mechanics. By adjusting parameters to various values, this theory can treat a wide variety of materials including elastic materials, Maxwell materials, Kelvin-Voigt materials, and (a nonlinearly generalized version of) simplified Israel-Stewart fluids, and thus we expect the theory to be the most universal description of single-component relativistic continuum materials. We also show that the presence of strains and the corresponding change in temperature are naturally unified through the Tolman law in a generally covariant description of continuum mechanics.",

This roll off at higher wavenumbers shortens the inertial range for the NS-?? model and thereby makes it more computable. We also explain how the NS-?? model is related to large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence modeling and to the stress tensor for second-grade fluids. We close by surveying recent results in the literature for the NS-?? model and its inviscid limit (the Euler-?? model). ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

The dual holographic model has been constructed by coupling a pseudo scalar to the gravitational Chern-Simons term in (3+1)-dimensional bulk gravity. In this paper, we investigate the non-relativistic fluid with Hall viscosity and curl viscosity living on a finite radial cutoff surface in the bulk. Employing the non-relativistic hydrodynamic expansion method, we obtain the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Hall viscosity and curl viscosity. Unlike the shear viscosity, the ratio of the Hall viscosity over entropy density is found to be cutoff scale dependent, and it tends to zero when the cutoff surface approaches to the horizon of the background spacetime.",

The method proposed is based on a V-cycle omitting the restriction procedure for dependent variables but retaining it for the residuals. This modification avoids possible mismatches between the mass fluxes and the restricted velocities as well as the turbulent viscosity and the turbulence quantities on the coarse grid. In addition, the pressure on the coarse grid can be constructed in the same way as the velocities. These features simplify the multigrid strategy and corresponding programming efforts. This algorithm is applied to accelerate the convergence of the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for both laminar and high-Reynolds number turbulent flows. Numerical simulations of academic and practical engineering problems show that the modified algorithm is much more efficient than the FMG-FAS (Full Approximation Storage) method. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

WENO spatial operators are employed for inviscid fluxes and central differencing for viscous fluxes. Internal and external viscous flow test problems are presented to verify the numerical schemes. The use of a WENO spatial operator not only enhances the accuracy of solutions but also improves the convergence rate for the steady state computation as compared with using the ENO counterpart. It is found that the present solutions compare well with exact solutions, experimental data and other numerical results.",

An overview of the different Navier–Stokes codes used in Europe is given, and on-going developments are outlined. The current state of progress is illustrated by computed steady and unsteady solutions to industrial problems, ranging from airfoil characteristics, flow around an isolated wing, to full aircraft configurations. A discussion on the future industrial design environment is given, and developments in Europe towards a more integrated design approach with underlying concepts like ‘concurrent engineering (CE)’ and the ‘virtual product (VP)’ are summarized.

The problem of interest is posed element-wise with weakly imposed Dirichlet boundary conditions. The Dirichlet boundary condition is supplied by a function on element boundaries which is determined such that weak continuity of the flux is assured. The approach allows the natural incorporation of upwinding at element boundaries, which is typical of discontinuous Galerkin methods, while retaining the same number of global degrees of freedom as for a continuous Galerkin method. The formulation also stabilises mixed incompressible problems which use equal-order interpolations. For linear elements, only minor modifications are required to existing continuous finite element codes, and the link to other stabilised methods is elaborated. The method is supported by a range of numerical examples, which demonstrate stability with minimal numerical dissipation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The influence of the head position, namely lifted up, aligned and lowered, on the wall shear stress and the static pressure distributions is analyzed. The problem is considered as 3D and in steady hydrodynamic state. Three velocities (1.4 m/s, 2.2 m/s and 3.1 m/s) that correspond to inter-regional, national and international swimming levels are studied. The flow around the swimmer is assumed turbulent. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are solved with the standard k-ω turbulent model by using the CFD (computational fluid dynamics) numerical method based on a volume control approach. Numerical simulations are carried out with the ANSYS FLUENT® CFD code. The results show that the wall shear stress increases with the velocity and consequently the drag force opposing the movement of the swimmer increases as well. Also, high wall shear stresses are observed in the areas where the body shape, globally rigid in form, presents complex surface geometries such as the head, shoulders, buttocks, heel and chest.",

          "abstract": "This paper compares in detail the lattice Boltzmann method and an isothermal Navier–Stokes method. It is found that these two methods are closely related to each other. Both methods satisfy similar macroscopic governing equations in their continuous forms, but they differ from each other in their discrete forms. Besides the obvious differences in stencils for spatial discretization, these two methods also differ from each other in temporal discretization. Numerical tests show that these differences have little impact on the simulation of velocity fields but do generate noticeable differences in the pressure fields. Both methods are capable of simulating transient flows and exhibit oscillatory behavior due to the propagation of pressure waves. The lattice Boltzmann method may be more accurate for capturing the pressure waves.",

Deployed systems require real-time and certified output prediction in support of immediate and safe, (feasible) action. The two essential components of our approach are (i) rapidly, uniformly convergent reduced-basis approximations, and (ii) associated rigorous and sharp a posteriori error bounds; in both components we exploit affine parametric structure and offline-online computational decompositions to provide real-time deployed response. In this paper we extend our methodology to the parametrized steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We invoke the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart theory for analysis of variational approximations of non-linear partial differential equations to construct rigorous, quantitative, sharp, inexpensive a posteriori error estimators. The crucial new contribution is offline-online computational procedures for calculation of (a) the dual norm of the requisite residuals, (b) an upper bound for the &#039;L(4)(Omega) - H(1)(Omega)&#039; Sobolev embedding continuity constant, (c) a lower bound for the Babuska inf-sup stability &#039;constant,&#039; and (d) the adjoint contributions associated with the output. Numerical results for natural convection in a cavity confirm the rapid convergence of the reduced-basis approximation, the good effectivity of the associated a posteriori error bounds in the energy and output norms, and the rapid deployed response.

This basis is obtained from the solution of a generalized constrained Stokes eigen-problem in the domain of interest. Faster convergence can be achieved by constructing a singular Stokes eigen-problem in which the Stokes operator is modified to include a variable coefficient which vanishes at the domain boundaries. The convergence properties of such functions are advantageous in a least squares sense and are shown to produce significantly better approximations to the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in post-critical states where unsteadiness characterizes the flowfield. Solutions for the eigen-systems are efficiently accomplished using a combined Laoczos-Uzawa algorithm and spectral element discretizations. Results are presented for different simulations using these global spectral trial basis on non-separable and multiply-connected domains. It is confirmed that faster convergence is obtained using the singular eigen-expansions in approximating stationary Navier-Stokes solutions in general domains. It is also shown that 100-mode expansions of time-dependent solutions based on the singular Stokes eigenfunctions are sufficient to accurately predict the dynamics of flows in such domains, including Hopf bifurcations, intermittency, and details of flow structures.",

The current method extends the previous gas-kinetic Navier-Stokes solver developed by Xu and Prendergast by implementing a general nonequilibrium state to represent the gas distribution function at the beginning of each time step. As a result, the requirement in the previous scheme, such as the particle collision time being less than the time step for the validity of the BGK Navier-Stokes solution, is removed. Therefore, the applicable regime of the current method is much enlarged and the Navier-Stokes solution can be obtained accurately regardless of the ratio between the collision time and the time step. The gas-kinetic Navier-Stokes solver developed by Chou and Baganoff is the limiting case of the current method, and it is valid only under such a limiting condition. Also, in this paper, the appropriate implementation of boundary condition for the kinetic scheme, different kinetic limiting cases, and the Prandtl number fix are presented. The connection among artificial dissipative central schemes, Godunov-type schemes, and the gas-kinetic BGK method is discussed. Many numerical tests are included to validate the current method.",

The basic algorithm is a multigrid method based on a robust, box-based smoothing step. Its most important feature is the incorporation of automatic, dynamic mesh refinement. Using an approximation to the local truncation error to control the refinement, we use a form of domain decomposition to introduce patches of finer grid wherever they are needed to ensure an accurate solution. This refinement strategy is completely local: regions that satisfy our tolerance are unmodified, except when they must be refined to maintain reasonable mesh ratios. This locality has the important consequence that boundary layers and other regions of sharp transition do not &quot;steal&quot; mesh points from surrounding regions of smooth flow, in contrast to moving mesh strategies where such &quot;stealing&quot; is inevitable. Our algorithm supports generalized simple domains, that is, any domain defined by horizontal and vertical lines. This generality is a natural consequence of our domain decomposition approach. We base our program on a standard staggered-grid formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for robustness and efficiency. To ensure discrete mass conservation, we have introduced special grid transfer operators at grid interfaces in the multigrid algorithm. While these operators complicate the algorithm somewhat, our approach results in exact mass conservation and rapid convergence. ?? 1992.",

One of the key challenges of this type of wave model, however, is to minimize the wave re-reflection from the incident boundary. Many numerical techniques have been developed to deal with this problem, and previous studies have reported on internal wave makers that employ NSE. Research on generation and transformation of irregular waves using a three-dimensional NSE model, however, has begun very recently, and few studies have yet been reported. In this study, a three-dimensional numerical model was applied to generate irregular waves, and transformation of irregular waves was simulated in a numerical wave tank. The model was first verified by applying it to simple numerical tests in two dimensions. The model was then used to generate directional monochromatic and irregular waves in three dimensions. The numerical results were compared with the analytical solutions, and good agreement was observed. Finally, the model was applied to simulate the transformation of irregular waves over an uneven bottom geometry in a wave tank.",

          "abstract": "This study is devoted to the incompressible and stationary Navier-Stokes equations in twodimensional unbounded domains. First, the main results on the construction of the weak solutions and on their asymptotic behavior are reviewed and structured so that all the cases can be treated in one concise way. Most of the open problems are linked with the case of a vanishing velocity field at infinity and this will be the main subject of the remainder of this study. The linearization of the Navier-Stokes around the zero solution leads to the Stokes equations which are ill-posed in two dimensions. It is the well-known Stokes paradox which states that if the net force is nonzero, the solution of the Stokes equations will grow at infinity. By studying the link between the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, it is proven that even if the net force vanishes, the velocity and pressure fields of the Navier-Stokes equations cannot be asymptotic to those of the Stokes equations. However, the velocity field can be in some cases asymptotic to two exact solutions of the Stokes equations which also solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, a formal asymptotic expansion at infinity for the solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations having a nonzero net force is established based physical arguments. The leading term of the velocity field in this expansion decays like |x| −1/3 and exhibits a wake behavior. Numerical simulations are performed to validate this asymptotic expansion when is net force is nonzero and to analyze the asymptotic behavior in the case where the net force is vanishing. This indicates that the Navier-Stokes equations admit solutions whose velocity field goes to zero at infinity in contrast to the Stokes linearization and moreover this shows that the set of possible asymptotes is very rich.",

Contrary to relativistic generalizations of the viscous stress tensor that appear in the literature, we find that the stress tensor should contain a correction to the comoving energy density proportional to the divergence of the four-velocity, as well as a finite bulk viscosity. These modifications are consistent with the framework of radiation hydrodynamics in the limit of large optical depth, and do not depend on thermodynamic arguments such as the assignment of a temperature to the zeroth-order photon distribution. We perform a perturbation analysis on our equations and demonstrate that, as long as the wave numbers do not probe scales smaller than the mean free path of the radiation, the viscosity contributes only decaying, i.e., stable, corrections to the dispersion relations. The astrophysical applications of our equations, including jets launched from super-Eddington tidal disruption events and those from collapsars, are discussed and will be considered further in future papers.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we give a derivation of the Lagrangian averaged Euler (LAE-α) and Navier-Stokes (LANS-α) equations. This theory involves a spatial scale α and the equations are designed to accurately capture the dynamics of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations at length scales larger than α, while averaging the motion at scales smaller than α. The derivation involves an averaging procedure that combines ideas from both the material (Lagrangian) and spatial (Eulerian) viewpoints. This framework allows the use of a variant of G. I. Taylor&#039;s ``frozen turbulence&#039;&#039; hypothesis as the foundation for the model equations; more precisely, the derivation is based on the strong physical assumption that fluctutations are frozen into the mean flow. In this article, we use this hypothesis to derive the averaged Lagrangian for the theory, and all the terms up to and including order α 2 are accounted for. The equations come in both an isotropic and anisotropic version. The anisotropic equations are a coupled system of PDEs (partial differential equations) for the mean velocity field and the Lagrangian covariance tensor. In earlier works by F oias , H olm &amp; T iti [10], and ourselves [16], an analysis of the isotropic equations has been given. In the second part of this paper, we establish local in time well-posedness of the anisotropic LANS-α equations using quasilinear PDE type methods.",

In the diffuse interface methods, the system evolution is driven by the minimisation of a free energy. The originality of our approach, derived from the Cahn-Hilliard model, comes from the particular form of the energy we proposed in [4], which, among other interesting properties, ensures consistency with the two-phase model. The modelling of three-phase flows is further completed by coupling the Cahn- Hilliard system and the Navier-Stokes equations where surface tensions are taken into account through volumic capillary forces. These equations are discretized in time and space paying attention to the fact that most of the main properties of the original model (volume conservation, energy estimate) have to be maintained at the discrete level. An adaptive refinement method is finally used to obtain an accurate resolution of very thin moving internal layers, while limiting the total number of cells in the grids all along the simulation. Different numerical results are given, from the validation case of the lens spreading between two phases (contact angles, pressure jumps), to the study of mass transfer through a liquid/liquid interface crossed by a single rising gaz bubble. The numerical applications are performed with large ratio between densities and viscosities and three different surface tensions.",

          "abstract": "A fractional step method for the solution of steady and unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is outlined. The method is based on a finite-volume formulation and uses the pressure in the cell center and the mass fluxes across the faces of each cell as dependent variables. Implicit treatment of convective and viscous terms in the momentum equations enables the numerical stability restrictions to be relaxed. The linearization error in the implicit solution of momentum equations is reduced by using three subiterations in order to achieve second order temporal accuracy for time-accurate calculations. In spatial discretizations of the momentum equations, a high-order (third and fifth) flux-difference splitting for the convective terms and a second-order central difference for the viscous terms are used. The resulting algebraic equations are solved with a line-relaxation scheme which allows the use of large time step. A four color ZEBRA scheme is employed after the line-relaxation procedure in the solution of the Poisson equation for pressure. This procedure is applied to a Couette flow problem using a distorted computational grid to show that the method minimizes grid effects. Additional benchmark cases include the unsteady laminar flow over a circular cylinder for Reynolds numbers of 200, and a 3-D, steady, turbulent wingtip vortex wake propagation study. The solution algorithm does a very good job in resolving the vortex core when fifth-order upwind differencing and a modified production term in the Baldwin–Barth one-equation turbulence model are used with adequate grid resolution.",

An influence matrix method, including a tau correction procedure, has been employed to elicit an algorithmic substitute for thea priorilacking boundary conditions for the vorticity. Following O. Daube (J. Comput. Phys.103,402 (1992)) the influence matrix is built by enforcing either the definition of the vorticity or the continuity equation at the boundary of the domain. The influence matrix is nonsingular in both cases. The order of the influence matrix is twice larger than one would expect from analogous solution methods based on finite differences or finite elements. The spatial discretization is based on a 2D Chebyshev expansion on anonstaggeredgrid of collocation points, and the boundary conditions are imposed via the Lanczos tau procedure. The time marching scheme is Adams–Bashforth for the advection term and Crank–Nicolson for the viscous term. The proposed scheme yields machine accurate divergence–free flow fields, and the definition of the vorticity is satisfied within machine accuracy.",

Unlike most previous work, the type of norm we consider for this analysis is neither a weighted supremum norm nor an -type norm, but involves the derivative of the observable as well and hence can be seen as a type of 1-Wasserstein distance. This turns out to be a suitable approach for infinite-dimensional spaces where the usual Harris or Doeblin conditions, which are geared toward total variation convergence, often fail to hold. In the first part of this paper, we consider semigroups that have uniform behavior which one can view as the analog of Doeblin’s condition. We then proceed to study situations where the behavior is not so uniform, but the system has a suitable Lyapunov structure, leading to a type of Harris condition. We finally show that the latter condition is satisfied by the two-dimensional stochastic Navier–Stokes equations, even in situations where the forcing is extremely degenerate. Using the convergence result, we show that the stochastic Navier–Stokes equations’ invariant measures depend continuously on the viscosity and the structure of the forcing.",

The pressure is treated explicitly in time, completely decoupling the computation of the momentum and kinematic equations. The result is a class of extremely efficient Navier-Stokes solvers. Full time accuracy is achieved for all flow variables. The key to the schemes is a Neumann boundary condition for the pressure Poisson equation which enforces the incompressibility condition for the velocity field. Irrespective of explicit or implicit time discretization of the viscous term in the momentum equation the explicit time discretization of the pressure term does not affect the time step constraint. Indeed, we prove unconditional stability of the new formulation for the Stokes equation with explicit treatment of the pressure term and first or second order implicit treatment of the viscous term. Systematic numerical experiments for the full Navier-Stokes equations indicate that a second order implicit time discretization of the viscous term, with the pressure and convective terms treated explicitly, is stable under the standard CFL condition. Additionally, various numerical examples are presented, including both implicit and explicit time discretizations, using spectral and finite difference spatial discretizations, demonstrating the accuracy, flexibility and efficiency of this class of schemes. In particular, a Galerkin formulation is presented requiring only C0 elements to implement. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The possibility of modeling the Navier-Stokes equations and together with the conventional second order slip boundary condition at high Knudsen numbers is explored in this paper by incorporating the Knudsen diffusion phenomenon in rarefied gases. An effective mean free path (MFP) model is augmented to the governing equation and the slip boundary condition, as gas transport properties can be related to the MFP. This simple modification is shown to implicitly take care of the complexities associated in the transitional flow regime, without necessitating dependency of the slip coefficients on the Knudsen number. Unique analytical model with fixed values of slip coefficients is proposed and rigorous comparisons with the experimental and simulation data for pressure driven and thermally driven rarefied gas flows support this conjecture. First and second order slip coefficients have been proposed as 1.1466 and 0.9756 for rectangular channels and 1.1466 and 0.14 for the capillaries, from the continuum to the transition flow regime. The current work is significant from the numerical simulation point of view because simulation tools are better developed for Navier-Stokes equations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A class of density and temperature dependent viscosity and conductivity coefficients is considered. This result extends P.-L. Lions&#039; work in 1993 [P.-L. Lions, Compacité des solutions des équations de Navier-Stokes compressibles isentropiques, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Sér. I 317 (1993) 115-120] restricted to barotropic flows, and provides weak solutions &quot;à la Leray&quot; to the full compressible model that includes internal energy evolution equation with thermal conduction effects. A partial answer is therefore given to this currently widely open problem, described for instance in P.-L. Lions&#039; book [P.-L. Lions, Mathematical Topics in Fluid Dynamics, vol. 2, Compressible Models, Oxford Science Publication, Oxford, 1998]. The proof uses the generalization to the temperature dependent case, of a new mathematical entropy equality derived by the authors in [D. Bresch, B. Desjardins, Some diffusive capillary models of Korteweg type, C. R. Acad. Sci., Paris, Section Mécanique 332 (11) (2004) 881-886]. The construction scheme of approximate solutions, using on additional regularizing effects such as capillarity, is provided in [D. Bresch, B. Desjardins, On the construction of approximate solutions for 2D viscous shallow water model and for compressible Navier-Stokes models, J. Math.

The liquid phase is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the gas phase by the Boltzmann equation, allowing to consider rarefied conditions inside the gas. The interface boundary conditions between the gas and liquid phases are derived. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved by a meshfree Lagrangian particle method called Finite Pointset Method (FPM), and the Boltzmann equation by a DSMC type of particle method. To validate the coupled solutions of the Boltzmann and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations we have further solved the compressible and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the gas and liquid phases, respectively. In the latter case both the compressible and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are also solved by the FPM.

Using continuous equal-order finite elements for both velocities and pressures, in a space semi-discretized formulation, we prove convergence of the approximate solution. The error estimates hold irrespective of the Reynolds number, and hence also for the incompressible Euler equations, provided the exact solution is smooth.",

In this paper, we discuss some extensions of ASPIN for solving steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with high Reynolds numbers in the velocity-pressure formulation. The key idea of ASPIN is to find the solution of the original system by solving a nonlinearly preconditioned system that has the same solution as the original system, but with more balanced nonlinearities. Our parallel nonlinear preconditioner is constructed using a nonlinear overlapping additive Schwarz method. To show the robustness and scalability of the algorithm, we present some numerical results obtained on a parallel computer for two benchmark problems: a driven cavity flow problem and a backward-facing step problem with high Reynolds numbers. The sparse nonlinear system is obtained by applying a Q1 - Q1 Galerkin least squares finite element discretization on two-dimensional unstructured meshes. We compare our approach with an inexact Newton method using different choices of forcing terms. Our numerical results show that ASPIN has good convergence and is more robust than the traditional inexact Newton method with respect to certain parameters such as the Reynolds number, the mesh size, and the number of processors. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "A third-order time-accurate projection method for approximating the Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible flow is presented. In order to compute a pressure unpolluted by spurious modes, two Chebyshev collocation spatial discretizations, where the pressure is approximated by lower-order polynomials than for the velocity, are compared. Only one collocation grid is used, and no pressure boundary condition is needed. The Navier–Stokes problem is reduced to the successive solution of Helmholtz problems for the velocity and pseudo-Poisson problems for the pressure. These problems are solved by direct methods. Using an exact solution, spectral spatial accuracy, and third-order time accuracy, for both the velocity and the pressure, are checked. The stability properties are discussed by considering the regularized cavity flow at various Reynolds numbers.",

In this study, the motion of bubble under ultrasound was predicted by a set of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations for the gas inside a spherical bubble and an analytical treatment of the Navier-Stokes equations for the liquid adjacent to the bubble wall. The theory permits one to predict correctly the bubble radius-time curve and the characteristics of the sonoluminescing gas bubble in sulfuric acid solutions, such as the peak temperature and pressure at the collapse point.

The novelty of the method lies in its treatment of the equation&#039;s non-linear operator, for which a new method is proposed that provides accurate simulations within an efficient framework. The method itself is a hybrid of two existing approaches, namely the quadratic expansion method and the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM), that have already been developed to treat non-linear operators within reduced order models. The method proposed applies the quadratic expansion to provide a first approximation of the non-linear operator, and DEIM is then used as a corrector to improve its representation. In addition to the treatment of the non-linear operator the POD model is stabilized using a Petrov–Galerkin method. This adds artificial dissipation to the solution of the reduced order model which is necessary to avoid spurious oscillations and unstable solutions. A demonstration of the capabilities of this new approach is provided by solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for simulating a flow past a cylinder and gyre problems. Comparisons are made with other treatments of non-linear operators, and these show the new method to provide significant improvements in the solution&#039;s accuracy.",

          "abstract": "An explicit staggered projection method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with no-slip walls is analyzed and used in simulations to address several issues related to the pressure boundary condition required when the continuity equation is replaced by the standard pressure Poisson equation (PPE), ???;2p = ???; {dot operator} ( - u {dot operator} ???;u + f). First, it is shown that a PPE system supplemented with a Neumann pressure boundary condition derived from the momentum equation can be made consistent with the Navier-Stokes equations if it is extended with the requirement that ???; {dot operator} ???;2u = 0 is zero near the wall and the solution is sufficiently smooth. This implies that it is possible to formulate a boundary condition for the standard PPE without the necessity to resort to Green&#039;s functions, which is interesting for theoretical reasons. Second, the equivalence is shown between the staggered projection method and the staggered discretization of above PPE system. The derivation of the equivalence sheds light upon the so-called PPE paradox and leads to an approximation of the wall value of ???p/ ??? n, which is not required but implied by the staggered projection method. Third, the (near-wall) regularity of a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is numerically analyzed by means of Direct Numerical Simulation of turbulent channel flow performed with the staggered projection method. From the numerical inspection of all terms of the momentum equation in the near-wall region, it is concluded that the three components of the momentum equation are satisfied on the wall for t &gt; 0 (for short times, but also in the turbulent regime). In the limit t ??? 0, the pressure gradient is observed to converge to the initial pressure gradient in the L2-norm, which confirms a disputed theoretical result in literature. Even in the maximum norm, the pressure gradient appears to converge to the initial pressure gradient. The only discontinuities observed in the simulations are the discontinuities of the tangential viscous terms and the time derivatives of the tangential velocities on the wall at t = 0. Thus the numerical results indicate that the regularity of the solution for turbulent channel flow is stronger than claimed by existing theory. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

In that spirit, we present a massively parallel high-order Navier-Stokes solver for large incompressible flow problems in three dimensions. The governing equations are discretized with finite differences in space and a semi-implicit time integration scheme. This discretization leads to a large linear system of equations which is solved with a cascade of iterative solvers. The iterative solver for the pressure uses a highly efficient commutation-based preconditioner which is robust with respect to grid stretching. The efficiency of the implementation is further enhanced by carefully setting the (adaptive) termination criteria for the different iterative solvers. The computational work is distributed to different processing units by a geometric data decomposition in all three dimensions. This decomposition scheme ensures a low communication overhead and excellent scaling capabilities. The discretization is thoroughly validated. First, we verify the convergence orders of the spatial and temporal discretizations for a forced channel flow. Second, we analyze the iterative solution technique by investigating the absolute accuracy of the implementation with respect to the different termination criteria. Third, Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire eigenmodes for plane Poiseuille flow are simulated and compared to analytical results. Fourth, the practical applicability of the implementation is tested for transitional and turbulent channel flow. The results are compared to solutions from a pseudospectral solver. Subsequently, the performance of the commutation-based preconditioner for the pressure iteration is demonstrated. Finally, the excellent parallel scalability of the proposed method is demonstrated with a weak and a strong scaling test on up to ??(104) processing units and ??(1011) grid points. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The main idea is to think of the image intensity as a &#039;stream function for a two-dimensional incompressible flow. The Laplacian of the image intensity plays the role of the vorticity of the fluid; it is transported into the region to be inpainted by a vector field defined by the stream function. The resulting algorithm is designed to continue isophotes while matching gradient vectors at the boundary of the inpainting region. The method is directly based on the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, which has the immediate advantage of well-developed theoretical and numerical results.

In particular, improved pressure boundary conditions of high order in time are introduced that minimize the effect of erroneous numerical boundary layers induced by splitting methods. A new family of stiffly stable schemes is employed in mixed explicit/implicit time-intgration rules. These schemes exhibit much broader stability regions as compared to Adams-family schemes, typically used in splitting methods. Their stability properties remain almost constant as the accuracy of the integration increases, so that robust third- or higher-order time-accurate schemes can readily be constructed that remain stable at relatively large CFL number. The new schemes are implemented within the framework of spectral element discretizations in space so that flexibility and accuracy is guaranteed in the numerical experimentation. A model Stokes problem is studied in detail, and several examples of Navier-Stokes solutions of flows in complex geometries are reported. Comparison is made with the previously used first-order in time spectral element splitting and non-splitting (e.g., Uzawa) schemes. High-order splitting/spectral element methods combine accuracy in space and time, and flexibility in geometry, and thus can be very efficient in direct simulations of turbulent flows in complex geometries.",

For steady-state problems, we show that the preconditioned problem has an eigenvalue distribution consisting of a tightly clustered set together with a small number of outliers. These characteristics are directly correlated with the convergence properties of iterative solvers, with convergence rates independent of mesh size and only mildly dependent on viscosity. For evolutionary problems, we show that implicit treatment of the time derivatives leads to systems for which convergence is essentially independent of viscosity.

Classical pressure-correction methods, such as SIMPLE and SIMPLER, are widely used as solvers in engineering analysis codes, but can also be used as effective multigrid smoothers. An inexact Newton method preconditioned by a linear multigrid method with a pressure- correction smoother can serve as a coarse grid solver. Ahybrid nonlinear multigrid scheme based on combinations of these components is described. Astandard benchmark problem is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of SIMPLER smoothing and the impact an inexact Newton coarse grid solver has on the resulting nonlinear multigrid scheme.",

          "abstract": "This paper describes the formulation of optimization techniques based on control theory for aerodynamic shape design in viscous compressible flow, modelled by the Navier-Stokes equations. It extends previous work on optimization for inviscid flow. The theory is applied to a system defined by the partial differential equations of the flow, with the boundary shape acting as the control. The Frechet derivative of the cost function is determined via the solution of an adjoint partial differential equation, and the boundary shape is then modified in a direction of descent. This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached. Each design cycle requires the numerical solution of both the flow and the adjoint equations, leading to a computational cost roughly equal to the cost of two flow solutions. The cost is kept low by using multigrid techniques, in conjunction with preconditioning to accelerate the convergence of the solutions. The power of the method is illustrated by designs of wings and wingbody combinations for long range tranport aircraft. Satisfactory designs are usually obtained with 20-40 design cycles. (Author)",

The objective is to avoid the severe time-step limitation usually encountered in confined axisymmetric geometries (e.g., pipe flow), caused by a fine azimuthal grid spacing around the centerline and the desire to refine the grid in the radial direction near walls. Avoiding severe time-step limitations usually involves treating all terms with derivatives in the radial and azimuthal directions with an implicit time-integration scheme. However, this leads to a set of coupled nonlinear equations which generally require complex and costly solution procedures. The scheme described in this paper decomposes the computational domain into two regions. Within each region only the derivatives in one coordinate direction is treated implicitly. Conditions at the interface between the regions are determined to maintain the overall temporal accuracy of the basic time-integration schemes. Results from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent pipe flow are validated against computational and experimental results from the literature. It is demonstrated that this new scheme allows for larger time-steps than other schemes, leading to significant CPU savings (17 Refs.)",

Unlike previous works, this class is independent of the viscosity and the strength of the noise. The two main tools of our analysis are the asymptotic strong Feller property, introduced in this work, and an approximate integration by parts formula. The first, when combined with a weak type of irreducibility, is shown to ensure that the dynamics is ergodic. The second is used to show that the first holds under a Hormander-type condition.

The formulation couples a velocity-pressure system with a vorticity-helicity system, and is intended to provide a numerical scheme with enhanced accuracy and superior conservation properties. For a few benchmark problems, we study the performance of a finite element method for this formulation and compare it with the commonly used velocity-pressure based finite element method. It is shown that both steady and unsteady discrete problems in the new formulation admit simple decoupling strategies followed by the application of iterative solves to auxiliary subproblems. Further, we compare several iterative strategies to solve the discrete problems and study the interplay between the choice of stabilization parameters in the finite element method and the efficiency of linear algebra solvers. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

          "abstract": "Phase-field models provide a way to model fluid interfaces as having finite thickness. This can allow the computation of interface movement and deformation on fixed grids. This paper applies phase-field modeling to the computation of two-phase incompressible Navier–Stokes flows. The Navier–Stokes equations are modified by the addition of the continuum forcing −C∇→φ, where C is the composition variable and φ is C&#039;s chemical potential. The equation for interface advection is replaced by a continuum advective-diffusion equation, with diffusion driven by C&#039;s chemical potential gradients. The paper discusses how solutions to these equations approach those of the original sharp-interface Navier–Stokes equations as the interface thickness ϵ and the diffusivity both go to zero. The basic flow-physics of phase-field interfaces is discussed. Straining flows can thin or thicken an interface and this must be resisted by a high enough diffusion. On the other hand, too large a diffusion will overly damp the flow. These two constraints result in an upper bound for the diffusivity of O(ϵ) and a lower bound of O(ϵ2). Within these two bounds, the phase-field Navier–Stokes equations appear to generate an O(ϵ) error relative to the exact sharp-interface equations. An O(h2/ϵ2) numerical method is introduced that is energy conserving in the sense that creation of interface energy by convection is always balanced by an equal decrease in kinetic energy caused by surface tension forcing. An O(h4/ϵ4) compact scheme is introduced that takes advantage of the asymptotic, comparatively smooth, behavior of the chemical potential. For O(ϵ) accurate phase-field models the optimum path to convergence for this scheme appears to be ϵ∝h4/5. The asymptotic rate of convergence corresponding to this is O(h4/5) but results at practical resolutions show that the practical convergence of the method is generally considerably faster than linear. Extensive analysis and computations show that this scheme is very effective and accurate. It allows the accurate calculation of two-phase flows with interfaces only two cells wide. Computational results are given for linear capillary waves and for Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. The first set of computations is compared to exact solutions of the diffuse-interface equations and of the original sharp-interface equations. The Rayleigh–Taylor computations test the ability of the method to compute highly deforming flows. These flows include near-singular phenomena such as interface coalescences and breakups, contact line movement, and the formation and breakup of thin wall-films. Grid-refinement studies are made and rapid convergence is found for macroscopic flow features such as instability growth rate and propagation speed, wavelength, and the general physical characteristics of the instability and mass transfer rates.",

The algorithms are based on coupling both p- and h-multigrid (ph-multigrid) methods which are used in nonlinear or linear forms, and either directly as solvers or as preconditioners to a Newton-Krylov method. The performance of the algorithms are examined in solving the laminar flow over an airfoil configuration. It is shown that the choice of the cycling strategy is crucial in achieving efficient and scalable solvers. For the multigrid solvers, while the order-independent convergence rate is obtained with a proper cycle type, the mesh-independent performance is achieved only if the coarsest problem is solved to a sufficient accuracy. On the other hand, the multigrid preconditioned Newton-GMRES solver appears to be insensitive to this condition and mesh-independent convergence is achieved under the desirable condition that the coarsest problem is solved using a fixed number of multigrid cycles regardless of the size of the problem. It is concluded that the Newton-GMRES solver with the multigrid preconditioning yields the most efficient and robust algorithm among those studied. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

This new family of numerical methods has first been proposed in [16] for purely hyperbolic systems and has been called PNPM schemes, where N indicates the polynomial degree of the test functions and M is the degree of the polynomials used for flux and source computation. A particular feature of the general PNPM schemes is that they contain classical high order accurate finite volume schemes (N = 0) as well as standard discontinuous Galerkin methods (M = N) just as special cases, which therefore allows for a direct efficiency comparison. In the application section of this paper we first show numerical convergence results on unstructured meshes obtained for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with Sutherland&#039;s viscosity law, comparing all third to sixth order accurate PNPM schemes with each other. In order to validate the method also in practice we show several classical steady and unsteady CFD applications, such as the laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate at high Reynolds numbers, flow past a NACA0012 airfoil, the unsteady flows past a circular cylinder and a sphere, the unsteady flows of a compressible mixing layer in two space dimensions and finally we also show applications to supersonic flows with shock Mach numbers up to Ms = 10. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Noisy and scattered versions of the analytical velocity field were generated, and the accuracy in reconstructing the analytical field was evaluated. It was found that accuracy depends on the value of a regularization parameter, and its optimal value depends on the entity of noise and scattering. When the optimal value is selected, the accuracy of the regularization technique is excellent, even for consistent noise and scattering levels.

This new evolution ODE, named {\it determining form}, induces an infinite-dimensional dynamical system in the space $X$ which is noteworthy for two reasons. One is that $F$ is globally Lipschitz from $X$ into itself. The other is that the long-term dynamics of the determining form contains that of the NSE; the traveling wave solutions of the determining form, i.e., those of the form $v(t,s)=v_0(t+s)$, correspond exactly to initial data $v_0$ that are projections of solutions of the global attractor of the NSE onto the determining modes. The determining form is also shown to be dissipative; an estimate for the radius of an absorbing ball is derived in terms of the number of determining modes and the Grashof number (a dimensionless physical parameter). Finally, a unified approach is outlined for an ODE satisfied by a variety of other determining parameters such as nodal values, finite volumes, and finite elements.",

In this approach, the nonlinear terms are usually approximated by an interpolation applied to the convective terms of the Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper, we introduce a radial basis function interpolation scheme for the velocity field, that satisfies the continuity equation (mass conservative). The proposed method performs better than the classical interpolation used in the DRM approach to represent such a field. The new scheme together with a subdomain variation of the dual reciprocity method allows better approximation of the nonlinear terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "The pressure is a somewhat mysterious quantity in incompressible flows. It is not a thermodynamic variable as there is no `equation of state&#039; for an incompressible fluid. It is in one sense a mathematical artefact-a Lagrange multiplier that constrains the velocity field to remain divergence-free; i.e., incompressible-yet its gradient is a relevant physical quantity: a force per unit volume. It propagates at infinite speed in order to keep the flow always and everywhere incompressible, i.e., it is always in equilibrium with a time-varying divergence-free velocity field. It is also often difficult and/or expensive to compute. While the pressure is perfectly well-defined (at least up to an arbitrary additive constant) by the governing equations describing the conservation of mass and momentum, it is (ironically) less so when more directly expressed in terms of a Poisson equation that is both derivable from the original conservation equations and used (or misused) to replace the mass conservation equation. This is because in this latter form it is also necessary to address directly the subject of pressure boundary conditions, whose proper specification is crucial (in many ways) and forms the basis of this work. The authors show that the same principles of mass and momentum conservation, combined with a continuity argument, lead to the correct boundary conditions for the pressure Poisson equation: viz., a Neumann condition that is derived simply by applying the normal component of the momentum equation at the boundary. It usually follows, but is not so crucial, that the tangential momentum equation is also satisfied at the boundary",

The algorithm is applied to both the discrete-adjoint and the discrete flow-sensitivity methods for calculating the gradient of the objective function. The adjoint and flow-sensitivity equations are solved using a novel preconditioned generalized minimum residual (GMRES) strategy. Together with a complete linearization of the discretized Navier-Stokes and turbulence model equations, this results in an accurate and efficient evaluation of the gradient. Furthermore, fast flow solutions are obtained using the same preconditioned GMRES strategy in conjunction with an inexact Newton approach. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated for several design examples, including inverse design, lift-constrained drag minimization, lift enhancement, and maximization of lift-to-drag ratio. In all examples, the norm of the gradient is reduced by several orders of magnitude, indicating that a local minimum has been obtained. By the use of the adjoint method, the gradient is obtained from one-fifth to one-half of the time required to converge a flow solution.",

Although they are traditionally solved using the finite volume, finite difference or finite element method, the lattice Boltzmann method is an interesting alternative solver for these equations since it is explicit and highly parallelizable. In this work, we first show that the most common implementation of the VANS equations in the LBM, based on a redefined collision operator, is not valid in the case of spatially varying void fractions. This is illustrated through five test cases designed using the so-called method of manufactured solutions. We then present an LBM scheme for these equations based on a novel collision operator. Using the Chapman-Enskog expansion and the same five test cases, we show that this scheme is second-order accurate, explicit and stable for large void fraction gradients.",

The method is based on a projection formulation in which we first solve advection–diffusion equations to predict intermediate velocities, and then project these velocities onto a space of approximately divergence-free vector fields. Our treatment of the first step uses a specialized second-order upwind method for differencing the nonlinear convection terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms suitable for inviscid and high Reynolds number flow. Density and other scalars are advected in such a way as to maintain conservation, if appropriate, and free-stream preservation. Our approach to adaptive refinement uses a nested hierarchy of logically-rectangular girds with simultaneous refinement of the girds in both space and time. The integration algorithm on the grid hierarchy is a recursive procedure in which coarse grids are advanced in time, fine grids are advanced multiple steps to reach the same time as the coarse grids and the data at different levels are then synchronized. The single grid algorithm is described briefly, but the emphasis here is on the time-stepping procedure for the adaptive hierarchy. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the algorithms&#039;s accuracy and convergence properties, and illustrate the behavior of the method. An additional example demonstrates the performance of the method on a more realistic problem, namely, a three-dimensional variable density shear layer.",

Numerical results for the two- dimensional driven cavity problem indicate that the spatial discretization of the equation defining the value of the vorticity on the boundary is extremely critical to obtaining accurate solutions. In fact, a standard one-sided three- point second-order-accurate approximation produces very inaccurate results for moderate-to-high values of the Reynolds number unless an exceedingly fine mesh is employed.

Kalita, A new paradigm for solving Navier-Stokes equations: streamfunction-velocity formulation, J. Comput. Phys. 207 (2005) 52-68], which avoids difficulties inherent in the conventional streamfunction-vorticity and primitive variable formulations. It is discovered that this formulation can reached second-order accurate and obtained accuracy solutions with little additional cost for a couple of fluid flow problems. In this paper, an efficient compact finite difference approximation, named as five point constant coefficient second-order compact (5PCC-SOC) scheme, is proposed for the streamfunction formulation of the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, in which the grid values of the streamfunction and the values of its first derivatives (velocities) are carried as the unknown variables. The derivation approach is simple and can be easily used to derive compact difference schemes for other similar high order elliptic differential equations. Numerical examples, including the lid driven cavity flow problem and a problem of flow in a rectangular cavity with the hight-width ratio of 2, are solved numerically to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the newly proposed scheme. The results obtained are compared with ones by different available numerical methods in the literature. The present scheme not only shows second-order accurate, but also proves more effective than the existing second-order compact scheme of the streamfunction formulation in the aspect of computational cost. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "Computer simulation of the flow field in crossflow membrane filtration in a porous tube and shell system depends on the imposition of permeable wall conditions on the surface of the inner tube. Porous wall conditions are often represented by the Darcy equation which relates the pressure gradients within a flow stream to the flow rates through the permeable walls of the flow domain. In crossflow filtration the feed stream which flows tangentially to the porous tube surface is modelled by the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations represent viscous laminar Newtonian flow. They can also be generalised to deal with non-elastic, non-Newtonian fluids. The existence of viscous stress terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, which are expressed in terms of second-order partial derivatives, makes the straightforward linking of these equations to the Darcy equation in a numerical solution scheme impossible. Therefore, in order to develop a fluid dynamical model for crossflow filtration, special techniques which resolve this difficulty must be used. In this paper first, various methods of linking the Navier-Stokes and the Darcy equations in a solution scheme are considered and the strength and weaknesses of these methods are discussed. Following this discussion the details of a novel method which is used to develop a robust, accurate and cost-effective finite-element simulation scheme for the combined Navier-Stokes/Darcy flows in crossflow filtration is presented.",

          "abstract": "We develop a parallel method and corresponding code for the numerical solution of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with application to the direct numerical simulation of transitional and turbulent flows through mechanical heart valves. The solver is based on a simple and efficient scheme, namely a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method on triangular and tetrahedral elements. Spatial discretization of the Stokes operator employed both equal-order (Pk−Pk) and mixed-order (Pk−Pk−1 ) velocity and pressure approximations. The interior penalty method and local Lax-Friedrichs fluxes are used for the discretizations of the viscous term and the nonlinear term in the divergence form, respectively.  A second order approximate algebraic splitting is used to decouple the velocity and pressure calculations leading to an algebraic Helmholtz equation for each component of the velocity and a consistent Poisson equation for the pressure. The consistent Poisson operator is replaced by an equivalent operator, namely that arising from the interior penalty discretization of the standard Poisson operator with appropriate boundary conditions. An explicit lower bound is derived for the penalty parameter of the interior penalty method that ensures the coercivity of the bilinear form. Efficiency aspects of the scheme include knowing an explicit expression for the penalty parameter of the interior penalty method and compact stencil size for the discretizations of the velocity and pressure equations and the nonlinear term.\r\n\r\nWe verify the accuracy and stability of the method on several two- and three-dimensional benchmarking problems. On the challenging Orr-Sommerfeld test problem, the equal-order polynomial approximation of the velocity and pressure (Pk−Pk ) leads to a stable and accurate solution, while the mixed-order method (Pk−Pk−1 ) yields a non-physical instability. In simulating vortex shedding past a square cylinder at Re = 100 and in simulating a three-dimensional backward-facing step flow u sing the equal-order method, excellent agreement with other computational and experimental results are obtained. The developed solver is used to study flow through a two-dimensional bileaflet mechanical heart valve geometry.\r\n\r\nWe conclude that the proposed discontinuous Galerkin method with the Pk−P k formulation is a suitable scheme for simulations of flows through mechanical heart valve geometries.",

          "abstract": "A fourth-order numerical method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in streamfunction/vorticity formulation on a two-dimensional non-uniform orthogonal grid has been tested on the fluid flow in a constricted symmetric channel. The family of grids is generated algebraically using a conformal transformation followed by a non-uniform stretching of the mesh cells in which the shape of the channel boundary can vary from a smooth constriction to one which one possesses a very sharp but smooth corner. The generality of the grids allows the use of long channels upstream and downstream as well as having a refined grid near the sharp corner. Derivatives in the governing equations are replaced by fourth-order central differences and the vorticity is eliminated, either before or after the discretization, to form a wide difference molecule for the streamfunction. Extra boundary conditions, necessary for wide-molecule methods, are supplied by a procedure proposed by Henshaw et al. The ensuing set of non-linear equations is solved using Newton iteration. Results have been obtained for Reynolds numbers up to 250 for three constrictions, the first being smooth, the second having a moderately sharp corner and the third with a very sharp corner. Estimates of the error incurred show that the results are very accurate and substantially better than those of the corresponding second-order method. The observed order of the method has been shown to be close to four, demonstrating that the method is genuinely fourth-order. © 1977 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

Such flow is generated by normal drop impact onto a dry substrate with high Weber and Reynolds numbers. An analytical self-similar solution for the viscous flow in the spreading drop is obtained which satisfies the full NavierStokes equations. The characteristic thickness of a boundary layer developed near the wall uniformly increases as a square root of time. An expression for the thickness of the boundary layer is used for the estimation of the residual film thickness formed by normal drop impact and the maximum spreading diameter. The theoretical predictions agree well with the existing experimental data. A possible explanation of the mechanism of formation of an uprising liquid sheet leading to splash is also proposed.",

Like the conventional differential quadrature (DQ) method, it discretizes any derivative at a knot by a weighted linear sum of functional values at its neighbouring knots, which may be distributed randomly. However, different from the conventional DQ method, the weighting coefficients in present method are determined by taking the radial basis functions (RBFs) instead of high order polynomials as the test functions. The method works in a similar fashion as conventional finite difference schemes but with “truly” mesh-free property. In this paper, we mainly concentrate on the multiquadric RBFs since they have exponential convergence. The effects of shape parameter c on the accuracy of numerical solution of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations are studied, and how the value of optimal c varies with the number of local support knots is also numerically demonstrated. The proposed method is validated by its application to the simulation of natural convection in a square cavity. Excellent numerical results are obtained on an irregular knot distribution.",

          "abstract": "In this thesis we address the numerical approximation of the incompressible Navier- Stokes equations evolving in a moving domain with the spectral element method and high order time integrators. First, we present the spectral element method and the basic tools to perform spec- tral discretizations of the Galerkin or Galerkin with Numerical Integration (G-NI) type. We cover a large range of possibilities regarding the reference elements, basis functions, interpolation points and quadrature points. In this approach, the integration and differen- tiation of the polynomial functions is done numerically through the help of suitable point sets. Regarding the differentiation, we present a detailed numerical study of which points should be used to attain better stability (among the choices we present). Second, we introduce the incompressible steady/unsteady Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations and their spectral approximation. In the unsteady case, we introduce a com- bination of Backward Differentiation Formulas and an extrapolation formula of the same order for the time integration. Once the equations are discretized, a linear system must be solved to obtain the approximate solution. In this context, we consider the solution of the whole system of equations combined with a block type preconditioner. The preconditioner is shown to be optimal in terms of number of iterations used by the GMRES method in the steady case, but not in the unsteady one. Another alternative presented is to use alge- braic factorization methods of the Yosida type and decouple the calculation of velocity and pressure. A benchmark is also presented to access the numerical convergence properties of this type of methods in our context. Third, we extend the algorithms developed in the fixed domain case to the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework. The issue of defining a high order ALE map is addressed. This allows to construct a computational domain that is described with curved elements. A benchmark using a direct method to solve the linear system or the Yosida-q methods is presented to show the convergence orders of the method proposed. Finally, we apply the developed method with an implicit fully coupled and semi-implicit approach, to solve a fluid-structure interaction problem for a simple 2D hemodynamics example.",

The algorithm which is based on a time-slitting of the convective terms from the generalized Stokes problem, comprises a point-wise characteristic integration of the convective terms and Uzawa integration of the generalized Stokes problem. The most costly part of the characteristic integration scheme is the search for an element containing the foot of a given characteristic. The present study uses a very efficient algorithm for element searching which is particularly useful for complex geometries. The implementation of the algorithm is discussed in the paper and the resulting code&#039;s performance is compared to that of a code based on a more conventional, fourth-order Runge–Kutta convection integration. A variety of flow problems are tested, including an analytical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations, flow in a lid-driven cavity, flow over a backward-facing step, and flow in an end-to-side anastomoses. In all cases, the proposed algorithm demonstrated performance superior to that of a conventional explicit treatment of the convective terms.",

          "abstract": "A fractional step method is developed for solving the time-dependent three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in generalized coordinate systems. The primitive variable formulation uses the pressure, defined at the center of the computational cell, and the volume fluxes across the faces of the cells as the dependent variables, instead of the Cartesian components of the velocity. This choice is equivalent to using the contravariant velocity components in a staggered grid multiplied by the volume of the computational cell. The governing equations are discretized by finite volumes using a staggered mesh system. The solution of the continuity equation is decoupled from the momentum equations by a fractional step method which enforces mass conservation by solving a Poisson equation. This procedure, combined with a consistent approximation of the geometric quantities, is done to satisfy the discretized mass conservation equation to machine accuracy, as well as to gain the favorable convergence properties of the Poisson solver. The momentum equations are solved by an approximate factorization method, and a novel ZEBRA scheme with four-color ordering is devised for the efficient solution of the Poisson equation. Several two- and three-dimensional laminar test cases are computed and compared with other numerical and experimental results to validate the solution method. Good agreement is obtained in all cases. ?? 1991.",

          "abstract": "We use the Cahn-Hilliard approach to model the slow dissolution dynamics of binary mixtures. An important peculiarity of the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations is the necessity to use the full continuity equation even for a binary mixture of two incompressible liquids due to dependence of mixture density on concentration. The quasicompressibility of the governing equations brings a short time-scale (quasiacoustic) process that may not affect the slow dynamics but may significantly complicate the numerical treatment. Using the multiple-scale method we separate the physical processes occurring on different time scales and, ultimately, derive the equations with the filtered-out quasiacoustics. The derived equations represent the Boussinesq approximation of the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. This approximation can be further employed as a universal theoretical model for an analysis of slow thermodynamic and hydrodynamic evolution of the multiphase systems with strongly evolving and diffusing interfacial boundaries, i.e., for the processes involving dissolution/nucleation, evaporation/condensation, solidification/melting, polymerization, etc.",

Because of the invariances of the Navier-Stokes equations, a positive answer in general to this question would imply global regularity for any data, so we introduce a new concept of weak convergence (rescaled weak convergence) under which we are able to give a positive answer.

The vorticity transport equation is considered together with a Poisson equation for the velocity vector, the latter equation being parabolized in time according to the false transient approach. The two vector equations are discretized in time using the implicit Euler time stepping and the delta form of Beam and Warming. A staggered-grid spatial discretization is employed in conjunction with a deferred correction procedure. Second-order-accurate central differences are used to approximate the steady-state residuals, written in conservative form for accuracy reasons, whereas upwind differences are used for the advection terms in the implicit operator, to obtain diagonally-dominant tridiagonal systems. The discrete equations are solved sequentially by means of a robust alternating direction line-Gauss-Seidel iteration procedure combined with a simple multigrid strategy. For the model driven-cavity-flow problem in two and three dimensions, the method is found to be efficient and very accurate. For the first time, the three-dimensional discrete vorticity and velocity fields, computed using a Poisson equation for the velocity vector, are both solenoidal and satisfy their mutual relationship, exactly. ?? 1991.",

Fluid dynamics considers the physics of liquids and gases. This is a branch of classical physics and is totally based on Newton’s laws of motion. Never- theless, the equation of fluid motion, Navier-Stokes equation, becomes very complicated to solve even for very simple configurations. This thesis treats mainly analytical vortex solutions to Navier-Stokes equations. Vorticity is usually concentrated to smaller regions of the flow, sometimes isolated ob- jects, called vortices. If one are able to describe vortex structures exactly, important information about the flow properties are obtained. Initially, the modeling of a conical vortex geometry is considered. The results are compared with wind-tunnel measurements, which have been an- alyzed in detail. The conical vortex is a very interesting phenomenaon for building engineers because it is responsible for very low pressures on build- ings with flat roofs. Secondly, a suggested analytical solution to Navier- Stokes equation for internal flows is presented. This is based on physi- cal argumentation concerning the vorticity production at solid boundaries. Also, to obtain the desired result, Navier-Stokes equation is reformulated and integrated. In addition, a model for required information of vorticity production at boundaries is proposed. The last part of the thesis concerns the examples of vortex models in 2-D and 3-D. In both cases, analysis of the Navier-Stokes equation, leads to the opportunity to construct linear solutions. The 2-D studies are, by the use of diffusive elementary vortices, describing experimentally observed vortex statistics and turbulent energy spectrums in stratified systems and in soap- films. Finally, in the 3-D analysis, three examples of recent experimentally observed vortex objects are reproduced theoretically. First, coherent struc- tures in a pipe flow is modeled. These vortex structures in the pipe are of interest since they appear for Re in the range where transition to turbulence is expected. The second example considers the motion in a viscous vortex ring. The model, with diffusive properties, describes the experimentally measured velocity field as well as the turbulent energy spectrum. Finally, a streched spiral vortex is analysed. A rather general vortex model that has many degrees of freedom is proposed, which also may be applied in other configurations.",

Furthermore, we provide here a clear and rigorous procedure for obtaining higher-order approximations to the continuum Boltzmann equation. The resulting macroscopic moment equations at each level of the systematic discretization give rise to the Navier–Stokes hydrodynamics and those beyond. In addition, theoretical indications to the order of accuracy requirements are given for each discrete approximation, for thermohydrodynamic systems, and for fluid systems involving long-range interactions. All these are important for complex and micro-scale flows and are missing in the conventional Navier–Stokes order descriptions. The resulting discrete Boltzmann models are based on a kinetic representation of the fluid dynamics, hence the drawbacks in conventional higher-order hydrodynamic formulations can be avoided.",

In this context, it can easily be shown that the fractional-step ??-schemes have only stage order q = 1 whereas the Crank-Nicolson scheme has stage order q = 2. Hence the fractional-step ??-scheme may have order reduction, if the method is applied on stiff ODEs and DAEs, i.e. the semi-discretised incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Some theoretical results and numerical examples illustrate this phenomena. Moreover, it is shown that it is impossible to improve the fractional-step-??-method such that the scheme has the stage order q = 2 and is strongly A-stable or has the order p = 3. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "This paper describes the finite difference numerical procedure for solving velocity-vorticity form of the Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions. The velocity Poisson equations are made parabolic using the false-transient technique and are solved along with the vorticity transport equations. The parabolic velocity Poisson equations are advanced in time using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) procedure and are solved along with the continuity equation for velocities, thus ensuring a divergence-free velocity field. The vorticity transport equations in conservative form are solved using the second-order accurate Adams-Bashforth central difference scheme in order to assure divergence-free vorticity field in three dimensions. The velocity and vorticity Cartesian components are discretized using a central difference scheme on a staggered grid for accuracy reasons. The application of the ADI procedure for the parabolic velocity Poisson equations along with the continuity equation results in diagonally dominant tri-diagonal matrix equations. Thus the explicit method for the vorticity equations and the tri-diagonal matrix algorithm for the Poisson equations combine to give a simplified numerical scheme for solving three-dimensional problems, which otherwise requires enormous computational effort. For three-dimensional-driven cavity flow predictions, the present method is found to be efficient and accurate for the Reynolds number range 100≤Re≤2000.

Some volumic control terms are directly introduced in the governing equations in order to prescribe immersed boundary conditions. The implicit numerical scheme, which uses an upwind finite volume method on staggered Cartesian grids, is of second-order accuracy in time and space. A multigrid local mesh refinement is also implemented, using the multi-level Zoom Flux Interface Correction (FIC) method, in order to increase the precision where it is needed in the domain. At each time step, some iterations of the augmented Lagrangian method combined with a preconditioned Krylov algorithm allow the divergence-free velocity and pressure fields be solved for. The tested cases concern external steady or unsteady flows around a circular cylinder, heated or not, and the channel flow behind a backward-facing step.

We consider the case of pure Einstein&#039;s gravity with a negative cosmological constant in the dual hydrodynamic regime. The holographic RG flow is a system of first order differential equations for radial evolution of the energy-momentum tensor and the variables which parametrize it&#039;s phenomenological form on hypersurfaces in a foliation. The RG flow can be constructed without explicit knowledge of the bulk metric provided the hypersurface foliation is of a special kind. The bulk metric can be reconstructed once the RG flow equations are solved. We show that the full spacetime can be determined from the RG flow by requiring that the horizon fluid is a fixed point in a certain scaling limit leading to the non-relativistic incompressible Navier-Stokes dynamics. This restricts the near-horizon forms of all transport coefficients, which are thus determined independently of their asymptotic values and the RG flow can be solved uniquely. We are therefore able to recover the known boundary values of almost all transport coefficients at the first and second orders in the derivative expansion. We conjecture that the complete characterisation of the general holographic RG flow, including the choice of counterterms, might be determined from the hydrodynamic regime.",

These algorithms are now used in the practical engineering design of devices such as cars and airplanes as well as theoretical studies of complex phenomena such as fluid turbulence. In past years, limited computer resources have motivated the development of efficient numerical methods in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) utilizing structured meshes. These meshes are comprised of systematic arrays of quadrilateral or hexahedral cells. The use of structured meshes greatly simplifies the implementation of CFD algorithms on conventional computers. Structured meshes also permit the use of highly efficient solution techniques such as alternating direction implicit (ADI) iteration schemes or multigrid. Following the dramatic improvement in computing speed in recent years, emphasis has shifted towards the design of algorithms capable of treating complex geometries. The automatic generation of structured grids about complex geometries is problematic. Unstructured grids offer one promising alternative technique for treating these general geometries. Unstructured meshes have irregular connectivity and usually contain triangles and/or quadrilaterals in two dimensions and tetrahedra and/or hexahedra in three dimensions. The generation and use of unstructured grids poses new challenges in computational fluid dynamics. This is true for both grid generation as well as for the design of algorithms for flow solution. The purpose of these notes is to present recent developments in the unstructured grid generation and flow solution technology.",

The numerical solution has been obtained by applying coordinate transformations and then using finite difference methods. Results are presented showing the flow around the creature as it accelerates from rest in an enclosed tank. The kinematics and dynamics associated with the creature&#039;s centre of mass are also shown. For a particular set of body shape parameters, the final mean swimming speed is found to be 0.77 times the speed of the backward-travelling wave. The corresponding movement amplitude envelope is shown. The magnitude of oscillation in the net forward force has been shown to be approximately twice that in the lateral force. The importance of allowing for acceleration and deceleration of the creature&#039;s body (rather than imposing a constant swimming speed) has been demonstrated. The calculations of rotational movement of the body and the associated moment of forces about the centre of mass have also been included in the model. The important role of viscous forces along and around the creature&#039;s body and in the growth and dissolution of the vortex structures has been illustrated",

          "abstract": "A Newton-Krylov method is developed for the solution of the steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations using a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization on unstructured meshes. Steady-state solutions are obtained using a Newton-Krylov approach where the linear system at each iteration is solved using a restarted GMRES algorithm. Several different preconditioners are examined to achieve fast convergence of the GMRES algorithm. An element Line-Jacobi preconditioner is presented which solves a block-tridiagonal system along lines of maximum coupling in the flow. An incomplete block-LU factorization (Block-ILU(0)) is also presented as a preconditioner, where the factorization is performed using a reordering of elements based upon the lines of maximum coupling. This reordering is shown to be superior to standard reordering techniques (Nested Dissection, One-way Dissection, Quotient Minimum Degree, Reverse Cuthill-Mckee) especially for viscous test cases. The Block-ILU(0) factorization is performed in-place and an algorithm is presented for the application of the linearization which reduces both the memory and CPU time over the traditional dual matrix storage format. Additionally, a linear p-multigrid preconditioner is also considered, where Block-Jacobi, Line-Jacobi and Block-ILU(0) are used as smoothers. The linear multigrid preconditioner is shown to significantly improve convergence in term of number of iterations and CPU time compared to a single-level Block-Jacobi or Line-Jacobi preconditioner. Similarly the linear multigrid preconditioner with Block-ILU smoothing is shown to reduce the number of linear iterations to achieve convergence over a single-level Block-ILU(0) preconditioner, though no appreciable improvement in CPU time is shown. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The starting point is the recognition that the vorticity (w???u) and the Lamb vector (l?w?u) should be taken as the kernel of a dynamical theory of turbulence. The governing equations for these fields can be obtained by the Navier–Stokes equations, which underlie the whole evolution. Then whatever parts are not explicitly expressed as a function of w or l only are gathered and treated as source terms. This is done by introducing the concepts of turbulent charge and turbulent current. Thus we are led to a closed set of linear equations for the averaged field quantities. The premise is that the earlier introduced sources will be apt for modeling, in the sense that their distribution will depend only on the geometry and the total energetics of the flow. The dynamics described in the preceding manner is what we call the metafluid dynamics.",

We have implemented this scheme in conjunction with spectral discretizations, which suffer from serious time step limitations at very high resolution. However, the approach we present is general and can be adopted with finite element and finite difference discretizations as well. Specifically, at each time level, the nonlinear convective term and the pressure boundary condition - both of which are treated explicitly in time - are updated using fixed-point iteration and Aitken relaxation. Eigenvalue analysis shows that this scheme is unconditionally stable for Stokes flows while numerical results suggest that the same is true for steady Navier-Stokes flows as well. This finding is also supported by error analysis that leads to the proper value of the relaxation parameter as a function of the flow parameters. In unsteady flows, second- and third-order temporal accuracy is obtained for the velocity field at CFL number 5-14 using analytical solutions. Systematic accuracy, stability, and cost comparisons are presented against the standard semi-implicit method and a recently proposed fully-implicit scheme that does not require Newton&#039;s iterations. In addition to its enhanced accuracy and stability, the proposed method requires the solution of symmetric only linear systems for which very effective preconditioners exist unlike the fully-implicit schemes. © 2011.",

The model butterfly moved under the action of aerodynamic and gravitational forces, where the aerodynamic forces were generated by flapping wings which moved with the body, allowing the body oscillations of the model butterfly to be simulated. The main results are as follows: (1) The aerodynamic force produced by the wings is approximately perpendicular to the long-axis of body and is much larger in the downstroke than in the upstroke. In the downstroke the body pitch angle is small and the large aerodynamic force points up and slightly backward, giving the weight-supporting vertical force and a small negative horizontal force, whilst in the upstroke, the body angle is large and the relatively small aerodynamic force points forward and slightly downward, giving a positive horizontal force which overcomes the body drag and the negative horizontal force generated in the downstroke. (2) Pitching oscillation of the butterfly body plays an equivalent role of the wing-rotation of many other insects. (3) The body-massspecific power of the model butterfly is 33.3 W/kg, not very different from that of many other insects, e.g., fruitflies and dragonflies.",

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust and efficient numerical method for the simulation of low Mach number flows in which the poorly distributed eigenvalues usually result in the numerical difficulties. The method takes advantage of the pressure-based and the density-based methods. It thus accelerates the numerical convergence by adjusting the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. In order to control the numerical instability and the spurious wave reflections at the numerical boundaries, a characteristic boundary condition is formulated. This numerical method as well as the boundary condition treatment extend the traditional fractional step method to the simulation of compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The performance and the accuracy of the method to calculate the flows with large amplitude of acoustic waves and strong heat transfer have been demonstrated by the direct numerical simulation of three distinct cases: a one-dimensional Euler equation with large amplitude of acoustic waves, an adiabatic turbulent boundary layer, and a turbulent boundary layer with heated wall. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "When an insect hovers, the centre of mass of its body oscillates around a point in the air and its body angle oscillates around a mean value, because of the periodically varying aerodynamic and inertial forces of the flapping wings. In the present paper, hover flight including body oscillations is simulated by coupling the equations of motion with the Navier-Stokes equations. The equations are solved numerically; periodical solutions representing the hover flight are obtained by the shooting method. Two model insects are considered, a dronefly and a hawkmoth; the former has relatively high wingbeat frequency (n) and small wing mass to body mass ratio, whilst the latter has relatively low wingbeat frequency and large wing mass to body mass ratio. The main results are as follows. (i) The body mainly has a horizontal oscillation; oscillation in the vertical direction is about 1/6 of that in the horizontal direction and oscillation in pitch angle is relatively small. (ii) For the hawkmoth, the peak-to-peak values of the horizontal velocity, displacement and pitch angle are 0.11 U (U is the mean velocity at the radius of gyration of the wing), 0.22 c=4 mm (c is the mean chord length) and 4 deg., respectively. For the dronefly, the corresponding values are 0.02 U, 0.05 c=0.15 mm and 0.3 deg., much smaller than those of the hawkmoth. (iii) The horizontal motion of the body decreases the relative velocity of the wings by a small amount. As a result, a larger angle of attack of the wing, and hence a larger drag to lift ratio or larger aerodynamic power, is required for hovering, compared with the case of neglecting body oscillations. For the hawkmoth, the angle of attack is about 3.5 deg. larger and the specific power about 9% larger than that in the case of neglecting the body oscillations; for the dronefly, the corresponding values are 0.7 deg. and 2%. (iv) The horizontal oscillation of the body consists of two parts; one (due to wing aerodynamic force) is proportional to 1/cn2 and the other (due to wing inertial force) is proportional to wing mass to body mass ratio. For many insects, the values of 1/cn2 and wing mass to body mass ratio are much smaller than those of the hawkmoth, and the effects of body oscillation would be rather small; thus it is reasonable to neglect the body oscillations in studying their aerodynamics.",

Weighted essentially nonoscillatory spatial operators are employed for inviscid fluxes and fourth-order central differencing for viscous fluxes. Two viscous flow test problems, laminar entry flow through a 90° bent square duct and three-dimensional driven square cavity flow, are presented to verify the numerical schemes. The use of the weighted ENO spatial operator not only enhances the accuracy of solutions but also improves the convergence rate for steady-state computation as compared with that using the ENO counterpart.

Our framework is based on a new flexible strategy to handle several degrees of freedom (DOFs) at nodes required for complex shaped embedded meshes as they occur for fixed-grid fluid-structure interaction problems. Boundary conditions on embedded boundaries are imposed weakly using a Nitsche type approach. Ghost penalty terms for velocity and pressure are added for stability reasons and to improve the conditioning of the system matrix. The idea of ghost penalties, previously developed for Stokes problems, is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by using face-oriented fluid stabilizations for both viscous and convective dominated flows. Furthermore, the need for additional terms to enforce boundary conditions for non-viscous flows is addressed. A detailed numerical study of our stabilized fluid formulation, including studies of Nitsche&#039;s parameter and the ghost penalty parameter, shows optimal error convergence and a good system conditioning in the viscous and the convective dominated cases. Compared to other fixed-grid fluid formulations, our method is much more accurate and less sensitive to the location of the interface. Regarding the accuracy and the sensitivity with respect to the interface position a clear improvement could be observed for the viscous and pressure fluxes as well as for the imposition of the boundary condition. Results of a transient two-dimensional high Reynolds-number flow over a cylinder and the flow over a thick plate in 3D confirm the applicability of the proposed method. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

          "abstract": "The Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations are shown to be strictly applicable only to incompressible flows, namely those involving fluids whose density is uniform throughout. Linear irreversible thermodynamic principles are used to derive an amended set of mass, momentum, and energy equations applicable to all fluids, compressible and incompressible, liquids as well as gases. These reduce to those of NSF in the incompressible limit. A modification of Fourier&#039;s heat-conduction constitutive law is also required as a consequence of the mass/volume velocity difference, wherein the heat flux is now defined in relation to the Second- rather than First-law of thermodynamics; that is, the heat flux is expressed in terms of entropy transport rather than energy transport, with the distinction between the two fluxes vanishing for incompressible flows. When solved subject to a no-slip boundary condition imposed on the fluid&#039;s volume velocity rather than on its mass velocity, the amended NSF equations are noted to furnish results in accord with a variety of experimental data for isothermal and nonisothermal, compressible and incompressible, gas and liquid flows. The difference between the fluid&#039;s volume and mass velocities, namely the diffuse flux of volume, is shown to constitute the hydrodynamic-level manifestation of the fluid&#039;s biased Brownian motion, with the bias arising from the inhomogeneity in mass distribution arising in compressible fluids from temperature or pressure gradients. Previously, continuum hydrodynamics, as embodied in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, has overlooked the fundamental contribution to fluid mechanics emanating from biased Brownian motion. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using this method, subiterations in pseudotime are required to satisfy the continuity equation at each time step. An upwind differencing scheme based on flux-difference splitting is used to compute the convective terms. The upwind differencing is biased based on the sign of the local eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix. Third-order or fifth-order spatial accuracy is maintained throughout the interior grid points. The equations are solved using an implicit line-relaxation scheme. This solution scheme is stable and is capable of running at large time steps in pseudotime, leading to fast convergence for each physical time step. A variety of computed results are presented to validate the present scheme. Results for the flow over an oscillating plate are compared with the exact analytic solution, good agreement is seen. Excellent comparison is obtained between the computed solution and the analytical results for inviscid channel flow with an oscillating back pressure. Flow solutions over a circular cylinder with vortex shedding are also presented. Finally, the flow past an airfoil at -90 deg angle-of-attack is also computed.",

However, due to a lack of analytical solutions, the models using the VANS equations are generally validated directly against experimental data or empirical correlations. In this work, a framework to design analytical solutions and verify codes that solve the VANS equations via the method of manufactured solutions is presented for the first time. Three test cases of increasing complexity are designed with this method and used to assess the second-order convergence of a finite volume solver developed in Open???;FOAM.

The governing equations of the model are derived from the 3-D primitive variable Navier-Stokes equations written in cylindrical coordinates in the rotating frame of reference. The latter are integrated along the radial direction and certain assumptions are made for the mean values of the radial derivatives. The validity of these assumptions is cross-checked through fully 3-D Navier-Stokes calculations. The resulting quasi-3D model suggests that three-dimensional and rotational effects be strongly related to the local chord by radii ratio and the twist angle. The equations of the model are numerically integrated by means of a pressure correction algorithm. Both laminar and turbulent flow simulations are performed. The former is used for identifying the physical mechanism associated with the 3-D and rotational effects, while the latter for establishing semiempirical correction laws for the load coefficients, based on 2-D airfoil data. Comparing calculated and measured power curves of a stall controlled wind turbine, it is shown that the suggested correction laws may improve significantly the accuracy of the predictions.

Then we establish the well-posedness of the unsteady Stokes equations and employ the solution to reduce our initial-boundary value problem into an initial-boundary value problem with absolute boundary conditions. Based on this, we first establish the well-posedness for an appropriate local linearized problem with the absolute boundary conditions and the initial condition (without the incompressibility condition), which establishes a velocity mapping. Then we develop apriori estimates for the velocity mapping, especially involving the Sobolev norm for the time-derivative of the mapping to deal with the complicated boundary conditions, which leads to the existence of the fixed point of the mapping and the existence of solutions to our initial-boundary value problem. Finally, we establish that, when the viscosity coefficient tends zero, the strong solutions of the initial-boundary value problem in ℝn(n ≥ 3) with nonhomogeneous vorticity boundary condition converge in L2 to the corresponding Euler equations satisfying the kinematic condition. © 2009 Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics.",

          "abstract": "Some known results regarding the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations were obtained by different authors. Existence and smoothness of solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions have been known for a long time. Leray showed that the Navier-Stokes equations in three space dimensions have a weak solution. Scheffer and Shnirelman obtained weak solution of the Euler equations with compact support in spacetime. Caffarelli, Kohn and Nirenberg improved Scheffer&#039;s results, and F.-H. Lin simplified the proof of the results of J. Leray. Many problems and conjectures about behavior of weak solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are described in the books of Bertozzi and Majda, Constantin or Lemari\&#039;e-Rieusset. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations with initial conditions (Cauchy problem) for 2D and 3D cases were obtained in the convergence series form by analytical iterative method using Fourier and Laplace transforms in paper $\cite{TT10}$. These solutions were received in a form of infinitely differentiable functions, and that allows us to analyze all aspects of the problem on a much deeper level and with more details. Also such smooth solutions satisfy the conditions required in $\cite{CF06}$ for the problem of Navier-Stokes equations. For several combinations of problem parameters numerical results were obtained and presented as graphs $\cite{TT10}$,$\;\cite{TT11}$. This paper describes detailed proof of convergence of the analitical iterative method for solution of the Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier - Stokes equations. The convergence is shown for wide ranges of the problem&#039;s parameters. Estimated formula for the border of convergence area of the iterative process in the space of system parameters is obtained. Also we have provided justification of the analytical iterative method solution for Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations.",

Over the last ten years, this problem has been cured by what is known as the momentum interpolation formula which is applied for evaluation of the cell-face velocities. In this paper two contributions are made. Firstly, it is shown that the momentum interpolation formula is a special case of a more general interpolation relationship that can be derived from a physical principle. In this sense, the relationship does not provide a unique formula for the interpolation of the cell-face velocity. In order to achieve unique interpolation practice, the second contribution of this paper relates to pressure-gradient interpolation. The results obtained from pressure-gradient interpolation compare extremely favourably with those obtained using staggered grid. ?? 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd.",

It consists of introducing a correct predictor for the pressure, one which is consistent with a divergence-free velocity field at each time step. The main objective is to allow a time variation of the pressure gradient at boundaries. From different test problems, it is shown that this method, associated with a multistep second-order time scheme, provides a time accuracy of the same order as the temporal scheme used for the pressure, and also improves the prediction of the velocity slip. Moreover, it does not exhibit any numerical boundary layer mentioned as a drawback of fractional steps algorithm, and does not require the use of staggered grids for the velocity and the pressure. Its effectiveness is validated by comparison with a previous time-splitting algorithm proposed by Goda (K. Goda, J. Comput. Phys., 30, 76–95 (1979)) and implemented by Gresho (P. Gresho, Int. j. numer. methods fluids, 11, 587–620 (1990)) to finite element approximations.

In this paper we propose a new consistent boundary treatment for this method, which is such that continuous integration-by-parts identities (including boundary contributions) are mimicked in a discrete sense. In this way kinetic energy is exactly conserved even in case of non-zero tangential boundary conditions. We show that requiring energy conservation at the boundary conflicts with order of accuracy conditions, and that the global accuracy of the fourth order method is limited to second order in the presence of boundaries. We indicate how non-uniform grids can be employed to obtain full fourth order accuracy.",

The two-parameter family represents flow which is rigid body rotation over each of two planes at a finite distance apart. The case of large Reynolds number is particularly interesting, since the two bounding planes are then separated by a region of rigid-body rotation and translation in which viscous effects are negligible.",

It is demonstrated that the relation between these terms is the principal reason for the use of the conventional staggered mesh with SIMPLE and other schemes. The important factors in the differencing are that it should lead to an elliptic scheme that satisfies the integrability constraint. The SIMPLE scheme automatically satisfies these two constraints. A non-staggered mesh scheme that also satisfies these constraints has been developed. Comparisons between it and a SIMPLE scheme for natural convection in a cavity indicate that the schemes have equivalent accuracy. For the non-uniform mesh used in this problem the non-staggered scheme is more efficient. It is expected that this increase in efficiency would be greater for adaptive and multi-grid algorithms.",

In the present approach a subdomain technique is used in which the integration domain is divided into small quadrilateral elements whose four edges are either isoparametric linear discontinuous or linear continuous boundary elements. The domain integrals in each subdomain are transformed into boundary integrals by dual reciprocity with augmented thin-plate splines, i.e. r2 log(r), plus three additional linear terms from a Pascal triangle expansion.

In particular, improved pressure boundary conditions of high order in time are introduced that minimize the effect of erroneous numerical boundary layers induced by splitting methods. A new family of stiffly stable schemes is employed in mixed explicit/implicit time-intgration rules. These schemes exhibit much broader stability regions as compared to Adams-family schemes, typically used in splitting methods. Their stability properties remain almost constant as the accuracy of the integration increases, so that robust third- or higher-order time-accurate schemes can readily be constructed that remain stable at relatively large CFL number. The new schemes are implemented within the framework of spectral element discretizations in space so that flexibility and accuracy is guaranteed in the numerical experimentation. A model Stokes problem is studied in detail, and several examples of Navier-Stokes solutions of flows in complex geometries are reported. Comparison is made with the previously used first-order in time spectral element splitting and non-splitting (e.g., Uzawa) schemes. High-order splitting/spectral element methods combine accuracy in space and time, and flexibility in geometry, and thus can be very efficient in direct simulations of turbulent flows in complex geometries. ?? 1991.",

A treatment of these singularities has to be considered in order to preserve the accuracy of high-order methods, such as spectral methods. The present work concerns the computation of a singular solution of the Navier–Stokes equations using the Chebyshev-collocation method. A singularity subtraction technique is employed, which amounts to computing a smooth solution thanks to the subtraction of the leading part of the singular solution. The latter is determined from an asymptotic expansion of the solution near the singular points. In the case of non-homogeneous boundary conditions, where the leading terms of the expansion are completely determined by the local analysis, the high accuracy of the method is assessed on both steady and unsteady lid-driven cavity flows. An extension of this technique suitable for homogeneous boundary conditions is developed for the injection of fluid into a channel. The ability of the method to compute high-Reynolds number flows is demonstrated on a piston-driven two-dimensional flow.",

          "abstract": "The development of robust and efficient algorithms for both steady-state simulations and fully implicit time integration of the Navier-Stokes equations is an active research topic. To be effective, the linear subproblems generated by these methods require solution techniques that exhibit robust and rapid convergence. In particular, they should be insensitive to parameters in the problem such as mesh size, time step, and Reynolds number. In this context, we explore a parallel preconditioner based on a block factorization of the coefficient matrix generated in an Oseen nonlinear iteration for the primitive variable formulation of the system. The key to this preconditioner is the approximation of a certain Schur complement operator by a technique first proposed by Kay, Loghin, and Wathen [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2002] and Silvester, Elman, Kay, and Wathen [J. Comput. Appl. Math. 128 (2001) 261]. The resulting operator entails subsidiary computations (solutions of pressure Poisson and convection-diffusion subproblems) that are similar to those required for decoupled solution methods; however, in this case these solutions are applied as preconditioners to the coupled Oseen system. One important aspect of this approach is that the convection-diffusion and Poisson subproblems are significantly easier to solve than the entire coupled system, and a solver can be built using tools developed for the subproblems. In this paper, we apply smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid to both subproblems. Previous work has focused on demonstrating the optimality of these preconditioners with respect to mesh size on serial, two-dimensional, steady-state computations employing geometric multi-grid methods; we focus on extending these methods to large-scale, parallel, three-dimensional, transient and steady-state simulations employing algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods. Our results display nearly optimal convergence rates for steady-state solutions as well as for transient solutions over a wide range of CFL numbers on the two-dimensional and three-dimensional lid-driven cavity problem. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This issue is addressed in relation to the discretization of inviscid and viscous fluxes. The discretization of the inviscid fluxes is carried out with both a centered and an upwind scheme. For the centered scheme, problems exist on mixed grids with the damping properties of the fourth-difference operator. The problems with the fourth-difference operator are investigated for two stencils by both truncation error and Fourier analysis. It is shown that one form exhibits superior damping for high frequencies, which is corroborated using numerical experiments. For the upwind scheme, a commonly used gradient-reconstruction method based on the Green-Gauss theorem does not show satisfactory behavior on mixed grids. Another gradient reconstruction method based on a Taylor series expansion previously derived in two dimensions is extended to three dimensions. This method is more accurate on mixed grids but requires more storage",

The results obtained are in good agreement with benchmark solutions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

As an application, they will be used to analyze a two-grid preconditioner for the Schur complement operator by the framework of {\it auxiliary space method} and the resulting analysis appears to be more transparent than what is available in the literature.",

Previous studies have suggested that it is important to consider contributions from terms traditionally neglected when assuming a uniform velocity and pressure distribution and a simple turbulence parameterization in surf zone hydrodynamics. In contrast with the Boussinesq and Nonlinear Shallow Water (NSW) equations models, in the RANS models none of the above-mentioned limiting assumptions is required, since no wave theory is imposed and the initiation of wave breaking is predicted by using an advanced turbulence model. Although the model has been widely validated in the laboratory, there is no previous study, to the best of the authors knowledge, which addresses the applicability of this model to random waves on natural beaches. Free-surface elevation and wave-induced velocity observations, from the SwashX field experiment, are used to validate this model. The model is able to satisfactorily predict the wave evolution and flow characteristics across the surf zone. The model provides a means to obtain high spatial and time resolution information of magnitudes which are difficult or impossible to measure in the field and therefore may contribute to improve our understanding on the physics of surf zone hydrodynamics. Moreover, it is also an excellent tool to obtain useful information of magnitudes involved in different kinds of modeling that require parameterization.",

On the other hand, the random force terms exhibit two peculiarities as compared with their elastic limit for molecular systems. First, they are not white but have some finite relaxation time.

High-order accuracy in time is obtained by marching the solution with Runge-Kutta methods. The incompressibility constraint is enforced for each Runge-Kutta stage iteratively either by local pressure correction or by a Poisson-equation based global pressure correction method. Local pressure correction is carried out on cell by cell basis using a local, fourth-order accurate discrete analog of the continuity equation. The global pressure correction is based on the numerical solution of a Poisson-type equation which is discretized to fourth-order accuracy, and solved using GMRES. In both cases, the updated pressure is used to recompute the velocities in order to satisfy the incompressibility constraint to fourth-order accuracy.

The decomposition modifies the Navier-Stokes boundary-value problem and produces a Laplace problem for a viscous potential, and a new Navier-Stokes sub-problem that can be solved on the portion of the domain where the total velocity has rotation. The key development in the decomposition is the formulation for the boundary condition on the viscous potential that couples the two components of velocity. An iterative numerical scheme is described to solve the decomposed problem. Results are shown for the steady laminar flow over a sectional airfoil, a circular cylinder with separation, and the turbulent flow around a slender body-of-revolution.

The energy distribution function is then coupled to the density distribution function via the thermal equation of state.

Comparison between the theory and the simulation provides a test to the validity of the assumptions in the theory. One of the insects is a model dronefly which has relatively high wingbeat frequency (164 Hz) and the other is a model hawkmoth which has relatively low wingbeat frequency (26 Hz). The results show that the averaged model is valid for the hawkmoth as well as for the dronefly. Since the wingbeat frequency of the hawkmoth is relatively low (the characteristic times of the natural modes of motion of the body divided by wingbeat period are relatively large) compared with many other insects, that the theory based on the averaged model is valid for the hawkmoth means that it could be valid for many insects.",

          "abstract": "A new Scale-Selective Discretization (SSD) procedure for the Navier-Stokes equations is proposed. The aim is to reduce the numerical dissipation of already existing numerical schemes to make the SSD scheme easily implementable to the existing CFD codes. In particular, the new procedure is designed to decrease the dissipation errors arising from the discretization of the convection term using upwind-biased convection schemes. Such dissipative errors reduce the quality of high-fidelity simulation approaches in fluid dynamics such as Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). The new discretization procedure is based on separating small and large scales of the flow using a high-pass filter. As a first pre-processing step the convecting velocity field u i is decomposed into a rapidly fluctuating part ui&#039; using the high-pass filter and a smooth part ui-ui&#039;. After this the derivatives involving ui-ui&#039; may be discretized with a centered scheme whereas the derivatives involving ui&#039; can be discretized using an upwind method. The new procedure is tested in Navier-Stokes simulations by implementing the method into a second order accurate incompressible finite volume code based on the fractional step method. The numerical tests on the 2D lid-driven cavity at laminar conditions Re=2500 imply that the new method clearly improves the quality of the simulations. At Re=10,000 the SSD scheme captures the post-critical state of the cavity flow. The advantages of the new method are quantitatively assessed by studying a 2D temporally evolving shear layer. The results imply that the SSD scheme significantly reduces the numerical diffusion in contrast to the conventional upwind-biased schemes. Results from marginally resolved turbulent channel flow at Re ??=590 imply that the new scheme can be used for 3D simulations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Navier–Stokes preconditioning is developed based on a Fourier analysis of the discretized equations and a dispersion analysis of the differential equations. Navier–Stokes preconditioning can be extended from the Euler technique with two methods: (a) by using block-Jacobi preconditioning for the viscous terms; (b) by introducing analytic dependence on the cell-Reynolds number in the preconditioner. With these techniques it is possible to produce a local Navier–Stokes preconditioner effective for all Mach and cell-Reynolds numbers. These techniques and a combined method are analyzed with respect to condition number and linear wave propagation and are illustrated with some numerical results.",

The original projection method was developed by Chorin, in which an intermediate velocity field is calculated from the momentum equations which is then projected onto the space of divergence-free vector fields. Our method is based on the projection method developed by Bell and co-workers which is designed for problems in regular domains. We use the continuity equation to derive a pressure equation to compute the gradient part of the vector field. An integral form of the continuity equation is used to give us a natural way to define the discrete divergence operator for cells near the boundary which ensures the diagonal dominance of the resulting pressure equation. We then use the restarted version of the GMRES method to solve the pressure equation.",

A novel complexity analysis estimates that structured programming time grows at least quadratically with the number of program lines. Further analysis demonstrates how an object-oriented strategy focused on mathematical objects renders the quadratic estimate scale-invariant, so the time required for the limiting factor in program development (debugging) no longer grows as the code grows. Compared to the coordinate-free C++ programming of Grant et al. [2000], grid-free Fortran programming eliminates a layer of procedure calls, eliminates a related need for the C++ template construct, and offers a shorter migration path for Fortran programmers. The grid-free strategy is demonstrated by constructing a Phys.-space driver for a Fourier-space Navier-Stokes solver. Separating the expression of the continuous mathematical model from the discrete numerics clarifies issues that are otherwise easily conflated. A run-time profile suggests that grid-free design substantially reduces the fraction of the procedures that significantly impact runtime, freeing more code to be structured in ways that reduce development time. Applying Amdahl&#039;s law to the total solution time (development time plus run time) leads to a strategy that negligibly impacts development time but achieves 58% of the maximum possible speedup.",

It is shown that the standard P1 scheme produces a pres- sure that is first order accurate in time, as noted by previous investigators. However the standard P2 scheme is shown to give a second order accurate in time pressure. It is shown that the first order behaviour observed by previous investi- gators for P2 schemes was an artifact of the means of testing the accuracy.

One is Marle model, and the other is Anderson-Witting model. As with Marle model, the temperature of the gain term was determined from its relation with the dynamic pressure in the framework of 14-moments theory. From numerical results of the relativistic shock layer problem, behaviors of projected moments in the nonequilibrium region were clarified. Profiles of the heat flux given by Marle and Anderson-Witting models were similar to the profile approximated by Navier-Stokes-Fourier law. On the other hand, profiles of the dynamic pressure given by Marle and Anderson-Witting models were quite opposite to the profile of the dynamic pressure approximated by Navier-Stokes-Fourier law. Additionally, we discuss the differences between Anderson-Witting model and Marle model by focusing on the fact that the relaxational rate of the distribution function depends on both flow velocity and molecular velocity for Anderson-Witting model, while it depends only on the molecular velocity for Marle model. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Integration to steady-state is performed using a multi-stage time-stepping scheme and convergence is accelerated by means of implicit residual smoothing and an unstructured multigrid algorithm. Directional scaling of thc artificial dissipation and the implicit residual smoothing operator is achieved for unstructured meshes by considering local mesh stretching vectors at each point. The accuracy of the scheme for highly stretched triangular meshes is validated by comparing computed flat-plate laminar boundary-layer results with the well known similarity solution, and by comparing laminar airfoil results with those obtained from various well-established structured quadrilateral-mesh codes. The convergence efficiency of Ihe presented method is also shown to be compctilive with those demonstrated by structured quadrilateral-mesh algorithms.",

However, introducing a nonunique velocity decomposition, $u(x,t)=\phi(x,t)+\nu(x,t)$, “opens up” the variational problem so that what is presumed a single allowable point over the velocity domain u corresponding to the unique solution of the Navier–Stokes equations becomes a surface with a saddle point over the extended domain $(\phi,\nu)$. Complementary or dual variational problems can then be constructed to estimate this saddle point value strictly from above as part of a minimization process or below via a maximization procedure. One of these reduced variational principles is the natural and ultimate generalization of the upper bounding problem developed by Doering and Constantin. The other corresponds to the ultimate Busse problem which now acts to lower bound the true dissipation. Crucially, these reduced variational problems require only the solution of a series of linear problems to produce bounds even though their unique intersection is conjectured to correspond to a solution of the nonlinear Navier–Stokes equations.",

It was previously applied to simpler two-dimensional simulations such as a Venturi type section [Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids, in press] and foil sections [Int. J. JSME B 45(3) (2002)]. The model is based on the code FineTurbo significantly modified to take into account the cavitation process. The numerical scheme consists in a time-marching algorithm initially devote to compressible flows. A low-speed preconditioneris applied to treat low Mach number flows. This numerical resolution is coupled to a single-fluid model of cavitation. The evolution of the density is governed by a barotropic state law proposed and validated previously by Delannoy and Kueny [Proc 1990 ASME Cavitation Multi-phase Flow Forum 98 (1990) p. 153] and Coutier-Delgosha et al. [Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 42 (2003) 527]. The present work focuses on the numerical stability of the Navier-Stokes equations associated to the barotropic state law. Fourier footprint representations are applied to several two-dimensional non-cavitating and cavitating flow field configurations,and the influence of the numerical and physical parameters on the stability is investigated. The influence of the preconditioner is also discussed: a modification is proposed in the two-phase areas,and its effect is tested in a two-dimensional Venturi type section flow configuration. A significant improvement is obtained concerning both the convergence level and speed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Under the assumption of analytic initial data, we construct solutions of Navier-Stokes for a short time which is independent of the viscosity. The Navier-Stokes solution is constructed through a composite asymptotic expansion involving the solutions of the Euler and Prandtl equations, which were constructed in the first paper, plus an error term. This shows that the Navier-Stokes solution goes to an Euler solution outside a boundary layer and to a solution of the Prandtl equations within the boundary layer. The error term is written as a sum of first order Euler and Prandtl corrections plus a further error term. The equation for the error term is weakly nonlinear; its linear part is the time dependent Stokes equation. This error equation is solved by inversion of the Stokes equation, through expressing the solution as a regular (Euler-like) part plus a boundary layer (Prandtl-like) part. The main technical tool in this analysis is the Abstract Cauchy-Kowalewski Theorem.",

          "abstract": "The Navier-Stokes equations are the governing equations of fluid flows. They are deemed to embody all physics in a flow of Newtonian fluids like water, especially when we assume the fluid is incompressible. Fluid flows are usually described in the Eulerian perspective wherein we focus on the fluid&#039;s quantities at a fixed point in space as time processes, rather than the motion of each individual particle. The latter perspective is indeed the Lagrangian perspective which is widely used in solid mechanics like elasticity. Thus, the Navier-Stokes equations should be and indeed they are always used in the Eulerian perspective. Here we show the right-hand sides of the Navier-Stokes equations were derived not in the Eulerian perspective but rather in the Lagrangian perspective, because the strain rates used in the derivation were the Lagrangian Cauchy strain rates. Thus, for describing fluid flows in the Eulerian perspective, the Navier-Stokes equations may lost some physics. To make it sure, we put the Cauchy strain into the material derivative, and then derive the Eulerian Cauchy strain rates. We find the difference between the Eulerian and the Lagrangian Cauchy strain rates is significant when in a turbulent flow. Therefore, On the basis of the Eulerian Cauchy strain rates, we derive a new set of governing equations for the flow of Newtonian fluids. The newly derived governing equations are fully in the Eulerian perspective. We believe they are the real equations that Navier, Cauchy, Poisson and Stokes intended to find for the viscous flow of Newtonian fluids.",

Particular attention is given to the construction of a pressure–velocity coupling procedure which is supported by edge data, resulting in a relatively simple numerical method that is consistent with the boundary and initial conditions required by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Edge formulas are presented for assembling the momentum equations, which are based on an upwind-biased linear reconstruction of the velocity field. Similar formulas are presented for assembling the pressure equation. The method is demonstrated to be second-order accurate in space and time for two Navier–Stokes problems admitting an exact solution. Results for several other well-known problems are also presented, including lid-driven cavity flow, impulsively started cylinder flow, and unsteady vortex shedding from a circular cylinder. Although the method is by construction minimalist, it is shown to be accurate and robust for the problems considered.",

The paper presents the formulation, validation, and application of a spectral/hp algorithm to the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations governing two- and three-dimensional stationary incompressible and low-speed compressible flows. The Navier-Stokes equations are expressed as an equivalent set of first-order equations by introducing vorticity or velocity gradients as additional independent variables and the least-squares method is used to develop the finite element model. High-order element expansions are used to construct the discrete model. The discrete model thus obtained is linearized by Newton&#039;s method, resulting in a linear system of equations with a symmetric positive definite coefficient matrix that is solved in a fully coupled manner by a preconditioned conjugate gradient method. Spectral convergence of the L2 least-squares functional and L2 error norms is verified using smooth solutions to the two-dimensional stationary Poisson and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Since such an additional mass diffusion transport mode should contribute to dynamic light scattering spectra, the consequences of the modified theory for light scattering spectra are discussed in this work. For liquids, the new theory is consistent with measured scattering data since the modification to the spectrum is usually negligible.

A general class of time-stepping schemes is analyzed in this context, showing the non-linear unconditional stability and long-term dissipativity of particular members of this family of algorithms. In particular, algorithms showing these strong properties which additionally involve the solution of a linear problem at each time step are identified. A particular linear algorithm is shown to exhibit optimal long-term dissipative properties and to possess an algorithmic global attractor. These abstract results apply rigorously to Galerkin mixed finite element discretizations of the problem.

We begin with a description of fluids within the framework of a continuum. We then discuss We begin with a description of fluids within the framework of a continuum. We then discuss various ways in which the response of a fluid can depart from that of a Navier-Stokes fluid. Next, we introduce a general thermodynamic framework that has been successful in describing the disparate response of continua that includes those of inelasticity, solid-to-solid transformation, viscoelasticity, granular materials, blood and asphalt rheology, etc. Here, it leads to a novel derivation of the constitutive equation for the Cauchy stress for fluids with constant, or shear and/or pressure, or density dependent viscosity within a full thermomechanical setting. One advantage of this approach consists in a transparent treatment of the constraint of incompressibility. We then concentrate on the mathematical analysis of three-dimensional unsteady flows of fluids with shear dependent viscosity that includes the Navier-Stokes model and Ladyzhenskaya&#039;s model as special cases. We are interested in the issues connected with mathematical self-consistency of the models, i.e., we are interested in knowing whether (1) flows exist for reasonable, but arbitrary initial data and all instants of time, (2) flows are uniquely determined, (3) the velocity is bounded and (4) the long-time behavior of all possible flows can be captured by a finite-dimensional, small (compact) set attracting all flow trajectories exponentially. For simplicity, we eliminate the choice of boundary conditions and their influence on the flows by assuming that all functions are spatially periodic with zero mean value over a periodic cell. All these results can however be extended to internal flows wherein the tangential component of the velocity satisfies Navier&#039;s slip at the boundary. Most of the results also hold for the no-slip boundary condition. While the mathematical consistency understood in the above sense for the Navier-Stokes model in three dimensions has not been established as yet, we will show that Ladyzhenskaya&#039;s model and some of its generalization enjoy all above characteristics for a certain range of parameters. We also discuss briefly further results related to generalizations of the Navier-Stokes equations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

A novel approach to eliminate the checkerboard spurious modes without introducing any non-physical dissipation is proposed. To do so, a fully-conservative regularization of the convective term is used. The supraconvergence of the method is numerically showed and the treatment of boundary conditions is discussed.

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a solution to Stokes’ paradox for asymptotically uniform viscous flow around a cylinder. The existence of a global stream function satisfying a perturbative form of the two-dimensionalNavier–Stokes equations for low Reynolds number is established. This stream function satisfies the appropriate boundary conditions on both the cylinder and at infinity, but nevertheless agrees with Stokes’ original results at finite ra- dius as the Reynolds number tends to zero. The Navier–Stokes equations are satisfied to a power-log power of the Reynolds number. The drag on the cylinder is calculated from first principles and the free parameter of the approach can be chosen to give good agreement with data on drag. In this revised working paper we put our approach on a firmer mathematical basis using the Helmholtz-Laplace equation as a linear approximation to the Navier–Stokes system. In so doing we demonstrate the instability of the original paradox. We also demonstrate the absence of a paradox of Stokes-Whitehead class, and give further theoretical constraints on the free parameters of the model.",

          "abstract": "Viscosity and magnetic fields drive differentially rotating stars toward uniform rotation, which has important consequences in many astrophysical contexts. For example, merging binary neutron stars can form a &quot;hypermassive&quot; remnant, i.e. a differentially rotating star with a mass greater than the maximum allowed by uniform rotation. The removal of the centrifugal support provided by differential rotation can lead to delayed collapse of the remnant to a black hole, accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation. Both magnetic fields and viscosity alter the structure of differentially rotating stars on secular timescales, making numerical tracking of the evolution difficult. Here, we present the first simulations of rapidly rotating stars with shear viscosity in full general relativity. We self-consistently include viscosity in our relativistic hydrodynamic code to solve the relativistic Navier-Stokes equations both in axisymmetry and in full 3+1 dimensions. In axisymmetry, we follow secular evolution with high resolution over dozens of rotation periods (thousands of M). We find that viscosity operating in a hypermassive star generically leads to the formation of a compact, uniformly rotating core surrounded by a low-density disk. These uniformly rotating cores are often, but not always, unstable to gravitational collapse. In the unstable cases, we follow the collapse and determine the mass and the spin of the final black hole and ambient disk. In all cases studied, the rest mass of the resulting disk is found to be 10-20% of the original star, whether surrounding a uniformly rotating core or a rotating black hole. This study foreshadows more detailed, future simulations of secular processes, including magnetic effects, in relativistic stars.",

The approach modifies the standard, dual-time stepping artificial-compressibility (AC) iteration scheme by incorporating ideas from pressure-based, fractional-step (FS) formulations. The resulting hybrid fractional-step/artificial-compressibility (FSAC) method is second-order accurate and advances the Navier-Stokes equations in time via a two-step procedure. In the first step, which is identical to the convection-diffusion step in pressure-based FS methods, a preliminary velocity field is calculated, which is not divergence-free. In the second step, however, instead of deriving a pressure-Poisson equation as in FS methods, the projection of the velocity field into the solenoidal vector space is implemented using a dual-time stepping AC formulation. Unlike the standard dual-time stepping AC formulations, where the dual-time iterations are carried out with the entire non-linear system, in the FSAC scheme the convective and viscous terms are computed only once or twice per physical time step. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method provides second-order accurate solutions and requires considerably less CPU time than the widely used standard AC formulation. To demonstrate its ability to compute complicate problems, the method is also applied to a flow past cylinder with endplates. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A special emphasis of this work is the performance for a relative high number of processors, i.e. with a low number of elements on the processor. For high order DG discretizations, a particular problem that needs to be addressed is the size of the blocks in the Jacobian. Thus, we propose a new class of preconditioners that exploits the hierarchy of modal basis functions and introduces a flexible order of the off-diagonal Jacobian blocks. While the standard preconditioners &#039;block Jacobi&#039; (no off-blocks) and full symmetric Gauss-Seidel (full off-blocks) are included as special cases, the reduction of the off-block order results in the new scheme ROBO-SGS. This allows us to investigate the impact of the preconditioner&#039;s sparsity pattern with respect to the computational performance. Since the number of iterations is not well suited to judge the efficiency of a preconditioner, we additionally consider CPU time for the comparisons. We found that both block Jacobi and ROBO-SGS have good overall performance and good strong parallel scaling behavior. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "Computational aeroacoustic (CAA) simulation requires accurate schemes to capture the dynamics of acoustic fluctuations, which are weak compared with aerodynamic ones. In this paper, two kinds of schemes are studied and compared: the classical approach based on high order schemes for Navier-Stokes-like equations and the lattice Boltzmann method. The reference macroscopic equations are the 3D isothermal and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A Von Neumann analysis of these linearized equations is carried out to obtain exact plane wave solutions. Three physical modes are recovered and the corresponding theoretical dispersion relations are obtained. Then the same analysis is made on the space and time discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations with the classical high order schemes to quantify the influence of both space and time discretization on the exact solutions. Different orders of discretization are considered, with and without a uniform mean flow. Three different lattice Boltzmann models are then presented and studied with the Von Neumann analysis. The theoretical dispersion relations of these models are obtained and the error terms of the model are identified and studied. It is shown that the dispersion error in the lattice Boltzmann models is only due to the space and time discretization and that the continuous discrete velocity Boltzmann equation yield the same exact dispersion as the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, dispersion and dissipation errors of the different kind of schemes are quantitatively compared. It is found that the lattice Boltzmann method is less dissipative than high order schemes and less dispersive than a second order scheme in space with a 3-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time. The number of floating point operations at a given error level associated with these two kinds of schemes are then compared. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The main tool we use in the proof is an explicit representation of the velocity in terms of the vorticity, by means of Green&#039;s matrices. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Differently from conventional FVM where the volume integrated average (VIA) value is the only computational variable, the present formulation treats both VIA and the point value (PV) as the computational variables which are updated separately at each time step. The VIA is computed from a finite volume scheme of flux form, and is thus numerically conservative. The PV is updated from the differential form of the governing equation that does not have to be conservative but can be solved in a very efficient way. Including PV as the additional variable enables us to make higher-order reconstructions over compact mesh stencil to improve the accuracy, and moreover, the resulting numerical model is more robust for unstructured grids.We present the numerical formulations in both two and three dimensions on triangular and tetrahedral mesh elements. Numerical results of several benchmark tests are also presented to verify the proposed numerical method as an accurate and robust solver for incompressible flows on unstructured grids. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

This allows the approximate conserved variables defining the discontinuous Galerkin solution to be locally condensed, thereby resulting in a reduced system which involves only the degrees of freedom of the approximate traces of the solution. The HDG method inherits the geometric flexibility and arbitrary high order accuracy of Discontinuous Galerkin methods, and offers a significant reduction in the computational cost as well as improved accuracy and convergence properties. In particular, we show that HDG produces optimal converges rates for both the conserved quantities as well as the viscous stresses and the heat fluxes.

          "abstract": "Collocation methods using piece-wise polynomials, including B-splines, have been developed to find approximate solutions to both ordinary and partial differential equations. Such methods are elegant in their simplicity and efficient in their application. The spline collocation method is typically more efficient than traditional Galerkin finite element methods, which are used to solve the equations of fluid dynamics. The collocation method avoids integration. Exact formulae are available to find derivatives on spline curves and surfaces. The primary objective of the present work is to determine the requirements for the successful application of B-spline collocation to solve the coupled, steady, 2D, incompressible Navier-Stokes and continuity equations for laminar flow. The successful application of B-spline collocation included the development of ad hoc method dubbed the Boundary Residual method to deal with the presence of the pressure terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. Historically, other ad hoc methods have been developed to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, including the artificial compressibility, pressure correction and penalty methods. Convergence studies show that the ad hoc Boundary Residual method is convergent toward an exact (manufactured) solution for the 2D, steady, incompressible Navier-Stokes and continuity equations. C1 cubic and quartic B-spline schemes employing orthogonal collocation and C2 cubic and C3 quartic B-spline schemes with collocation at the Greville points are investigated. The C3 quartic Greville scheme is shown to be the most efficient scheme for a given accuracy, even though the C1 quartic orthogonal scheme is the most accurate for a given partition. Two solution approaches are employed, including a globally-convergent zero-finding Newton&#039;s method using an LU decomposition direct solver and the variable-metric minimization method using BFGS update. ??

Existence and uniqueness results for the solution of the time-dependent, three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations are also established. These investigations are based on a theory of extensions of time-dependent, solenoidal vector fields that is developed in this paper. The results of this paper are indispensable to the study of optimal control problems with boundary control for the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations.",

We first reformulate the Navier boundary condition in terms of the vorticity, which is motivated by the Hodge theory on manifolds with boundary from the viewpoint of differential geometry, and establish basic elliptic estimates for vector fields subject to the kinematic and Navier boundary conditions. Then we develop a spectral theory of the Stokes operator acting on divergence-free vector fields on a domain with the kinematic and Navier boundary conditions. Finally, we employ the spectral theory and the necessary estimates to construct the Galerkin approximate solutions and establish their convergence to global weak solutions, as well as local strong solutions, of the initial-boundary problem. Furthermore, we show as a corollary that, when the slip length tends to zero, the weak solutions constructed converge to a solution to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to the no-slip boundary condition for almost all time. The inviscid limit of the strong solutions to the unique solutions of the initial-boundary value problem with the slip boundary condition for the Euler equations is also established.",

          "abstract": "This article describes a self-similarity soln. of the Navier-Stokes equations for a laminar, incompressible, and time-dependent flow that develops within a channel possessing permeable, moving walls. The case considered here pertains to a channel that exhibits either injection or suction across two opposing porous walls while undergoing uniform expansion or contraction. Instances of direct application include the modeling of pulsating diaphragms, sweat cooling or heating, isotope sepn., filtration, paper manufg., irrigation, and the grain regression during solid propellant combustion. To start, the stream function and the vorticity equation are used in concert to yield a partial differential equation that lends itself to a similarity transformation. Following this similarity transformation, the original problem is reduced to solving a fourth-order differential equation in one similarity variable η that combines both space and time dimensions. Since two of the four auxiliary conditions are of the boundary value type, a numerical soln. becomes dependent upon two initial guesses. In order to achieve convergence, the governing equation is first transformed into a function of three variables: The two guesses and η. At the outset, a suitable numerical algorithm is applied by solving the resulting set of twelve first-order ordinary differential equations with two unspecified start-up conditions. In seeking the two unknown initial guesses, the rapidly converging inverse Jacobian method is applied in an iterative fashion. Numerical results are later used to ascertain a deeper understanding of the flow character. The numerical scheme enables us to extend the soln. range to phys. settings not considered in previous studies. Moreover, the numerical approach broadens the scope to cover both suction and injection cases occurring with simultaneous wall motion. [on SciFinder(R)]",

The spatial iterative methods consist in solving the stationary Stokes scheme, Newton scheme, Oseen scheme based on the spatial discretization under some strong uniqueness assumptions.

          "abstract": "The incompressible {Navier-Stokes} equations have been widely studied due to their vast ability to model hydrodynamic phenomena. The nonlinear character of these equations produces a hierarchical system of dynamical scales that offer challenging barriers to computation simulation and scale elimination modeling. Here, the incompressible {Navier-Stokes} equations are decomposed and studied under the context of global eigensystems that have a direct relation to the dynamical character of the scales-of-motion. In particular, the self-adjoint linear {Reynolds-Orr} operator is shown to correspond to the energy operator of this nonlinear system of equations and has the distinguishing property of having an eigensystem that orders the time derivative of the integral kinetic energy for the nonlinear {Navier-Stokes} operator. The eigensystem of the {Reynolds-Orr} operator is shown to yield a dynamical range of scales that can be characterized by an energy-containing range, an inertial range, and a dissipation range. It is shown that a canonical decomposition of the incompressible {Navier-Stokes} equations has only a finite number of scales that are responsible for the unsteady character of the nonlinear system. Furthermore, a time-dependent growth of the kinetic energy is characterized without the need for a classical linearized instability. Discussions are presented and estimates are made on the various underlying scaling characteristics, and a contrast is made to empirical eigenfunctions found by ordering the integral kinetic energy.",

The issue of how to correctly specify numerical boundary conditions for these methods has been outstanding since the birth of the second-order methodology a decade and a half ago. It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary conditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connection between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail.",

          "abstract": "In this article we study the fractal Navier-Stokes equations by using stochastic Lagrangian particle path approach in Constantin and Iyer \cite{Co-Iy}. More precisely, a stochastic representation for the fractal Navier-Stokes equations is given in terms of stochastic differential equations driven by L\&#039;evy processes. Basing on this representation, a self-contained proof for the existence of local unique solution for the fractal Navier-Stokes equation with initial data in $\mW^{1,p}$ is provided, and in the case of two dimensions or large viscosity, the existence of global solution is also obtained. In order to obtain the global existence in any dimensions for large viscosity, the gradient estimates for L\&#039;evy processes with time dependent and discontinuous drifts is proved.",

The time evolution of the vorticity is solved as an ODE problem on each node of the spatial discretization, using at each step of the time dis- cretization the spatial solution for the velocity field provided by a new PDE expression called the kinematic Laplacian equation (KLE). This complete decoupling of the two vari- ables in a vorticity-in-time/velocity-in-space split algorithm reduces the number of un- knowns to solve in the time-integration process and also favors the use of advanced ODE algorithms enhancing the efficiency and robustness of time integration. The issue of the imposition of vorticity boundary conditions is addressed, as well as the details of the im- plementation of the KLE by isoparametric finite element discretization. We shall see some validation results of the KLE method applied to the classical case of a circular cylinder in impulsive-started pure-translational steady motion at several Reynolds numbers in the range 5 &lt; Re &lt; 180, comparing them with experimental measurements and flow visual- ization plates; and finally, a recent result from a study on periodic vortex-array structures produced in the wake of forced-oscillating cylinders.",

The procedure, when applied to a system of partial differential equations, yields reduced sets of equations with one fewer independent variables. We find eight possibilities for reducing the Navier-Stokes equations in the three spatial and one temporal dimensions to sets of partial differential equations in three independent variables. Some of these reductions are derivable using the Lie-group method of classical symmetries but the remainder are genuinely nonclassical. Further investigations of one of our eight forms shows how it is possible to derive novel exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations by the nonclassical method.",

We give a unified analysis of the entire three-parameter family using only abstract mapping properties of the principle dissipation and smoothing operators, and then use specific parameterizations to obtain the sharpest results. We first establish existence and regularity results, and under appropriate assumptions show uniqueness and stability. We then establish results for singular perturbations, including the inviscid and alpha limits. Next we show existence of a global attractor for the general model, and give estimates for its dimension. We finish by establishing some results on determining operators for subfamilies of dissipative and non-dissipative models. In addition to establishing a number of results for all models in this general family, the framework recovers most of the previous results on existence, regularity, uniqueness, stability, attractor existence and dimension, and determining operators for well-known members of this family.",

For the Euler equations we consider the case where the vorticity converges to the corresponding self-similar voriticity profile in the sense of the critical Besov space norm, $\dot{B}^0_{1, \infty}(\Bbb R^3)$. For the Navier-Stokes equations the convergence of the velocity to the self-similar singularity is in $L^q(B(z,r))$ for some $q\in [2, \infty)$, where the ball of radius $r$ is shrinking toward a possible singularity point $z$ at the order of $\sqrt{T-t}$ as $t$ approaches to $T$. In the $L^q (\Bbb R^3)$ convergence case with $q\in [3, \infty)$ we present a simple alternative proof of the similar result in \cite{hou}.",

The results illustrate that the application of the Padé approximants in the DTM and HPM is an appropriate method in solving the Navier–Stokes equations with the boundary conditions at infinity.

In essence, the Lagrangian solid mesh, which represents the immersed deformable cells, is set to move on top of a background Eulerian mesh. The eects of cell–cell interaction (adhesive=repulsive) and hydrody- namic forces on RBC aggregates are studied by introducing equivalent protein molecular potentials into the immersed nite element method. The aggregation of red blood cells in quiescent uids is simulated. The de-aggregation of a RBC cluster at dierent shear rates is also investigated to pro- vide an explanation of the shear-rate-dependence of the blood viscoelastic properties. Finally, the in- uences of cell–cell interaction, RBC rigidity, and vessel geometry are addressed in a series of test cases with deformable cells (normal and sickle RBCs) passing through micro- and capillary vessels.",

Forced time-dependent disturbances are introduced into the flow field and the reaction of the flow to such disturbances is studied by directly solving the Navier–Stokes equations using a finite-difference method. An implicit finite-difference scheme was developed for the calculation of the extremely unsteady flow fields which arose from the forced time-dependent disturbances. The problem of the numerical stability of the method called for special attention in order to avoid possible distortions of the results caused by the interaction of unstable numerical oscillations with physically meaningful perturbations. A demonstration of the suitability of the numerical method for the investigation of stability and the initial growth of disturbances is presented for small periodic perturbations. For this particular case the numerical results can be compared with linear stability theory and experimental measurements. In this paper a number of numerical calculations for small periodic disturbances are discussed in detail. The results are generally in fairly close agreement with linear stability theory or experimental measurements.",

For this reason, this class of numerical methods is especially attractive for use on parallel (MIMD, local memory) computers. In this paper, we describe a parallel multigrid solver for steady-state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on general domains which is currently being developed at the GMD. Due to the geometrical generality of the problem, our approach is based on a non-staggered (nodal-point) finite volume scheme on multi-block boundary fitted grids. The typical instability of non-staggered schemes is overcome by suitably modifying the discrete continuity equation without affecting the overall order of consistency. Starting from the most simple Cartesian case, we discuss several possible multigrid approaches to the general 2D-problem. This motivates the basic design decisions of our multigrid solver in regard to both the discretization and the choice of multigrid components (smoothing schemes). Furthermore, the principal technique of parallelization (grid partitioning) is described as well as some fundamental aspects of the implementation (communication library). ?? 1988.",

Friction in fluids generally manifests itself through shearing forces that retard the relative motion of fluid particles. A measure of the relative motion of fluid particles is furnished by the velocity gradient. In addition, it is shown that a solution of the Navier–Stokes equations with a given Reynolds number can be used to generate solutions that have different length and velocity scales but the same Reynolds number. This fact allows to model a given flow situation in the laboratory by adjusting the length and velocity scales and the viscosity to give an experimentally tractable problem with the same Reynolds number.

It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary con- ditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incom- pressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connec- tion between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail. 2001",

This connection allows us to construct a flux splitting for the Navier-Stokes equations based on the direction of molecular motion from which a numerical flux can be obtained. The naive use of such a numerical flux function in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization leads to an unstable scheme in the viscous dominated case. Stable schemes are constructed by adding additional terms either in a symmetric or non-symmetric manner which are motivated by the DG schemes for elliptic equations. The novelty of the present scheme is the use of kinetic fluxes to construct the stabilization terms. In the symmetric case, interior penalty terms have to be added for stability and the resulting schemes give optimal convergence rates in numerical experiments. The non-symmetric schemes lead to a cell energy/entropy inequality but exhibit sub-optimal convergence rates. These properties are studied by applying the schemes to a scalar convection-diffusion equation and the 1-D compressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the case of Navier-Stokes equations, entropy variables are used to construct stable schemes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

So far, this problem has been cured either by evaluating the cell face velocities by the momentum interpolated principle [1] or by evaluating an effective pressure gradient in the nodal momentum equations [2]. In this article it is shown that not only are these practices unnecessary, they can lead to spurious results when the true pressure variation departs considerably from linearity. What is required instead is afresh derivation of the pressure correction equation appropriate for a nonstaggered grid. The pressure correction determined from this equation comprises two components: a mass-conserving component and a smoothing component. The former corresponds to the pressure correction predicted by a staggered grid procedure, whereas the latter simply accounts for the difference between the point value of the pressure and the cell-averaged value of the pressure. The new pressure correction equation facilitates (in a significant way) computer coding of programs written for three-dimensional geometries employing body-fitted curvilinear coordinate grids.",

A new similarity transformation for the controlling equations with boundary conditions was given so as to obtain the ordinary differential controlling equation. An analytical solution was provided for this strong nonlinear ordinary differential equation using a powerful, easy-to-use analytic technique for nonlinear problems, that is, the homotopy analysis method (HAM). By analyzing solutions and comparing with the results of other investigators, it is proved that the results are not accurate or physically wrong either obtained from calculation of Navier-Stokes equations with first-order boundary condition or second-order slip boundary condition in transition flow region, although some parameters may fit well with the experimental data. So, Navier-Stokes equations cannot govern the gaseous flow in transition region. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We introduce here a complete formulation using a modal basis which has been implemented in a new code N??{lunate}??T??r. The new basis has the following properties: Jacobi polynomials of mixed weights; semi-orthogonality; hierarchical structure; generalized tensor (warped) product; variable order; and a new apex co-ordinate system allowing automated integration with Gaussian quadrature. We have discussed the formulation using a matrix notation which allows for an easy interpretation of the forward and backward transformations. We use this notation to formulate the linear advection and Helmholtz equations in an efficient manner and show that we recover the following properties: well conditioned matrices; asymptotic operation count of O(N3); scaling O(N2) of the spectral radius of the weak convective operator; and exponential convergence using polynomials up to ???- 40. Having constructed and numerically analysed these equations we are then able to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a high-order splitting scheme. We demonstrate a variety of results showing exponential convergence using both deformed and straight triangular subdomains for both the Stokes and Navier-Stokes problems. ?? 1995.",

The new method is based on a discontinuous Galerkin formulation both for the advective and the diffusive contributions. High-order accuracy is achieved by using a recently developed hierarchical spectral basis. This basis is formed by combining Jacobi polynomials of high-order weights written in a new co-ordinate systems. It retains a tensor-product property, and provides accurate numerical quadrature. The formulation is conservative, and monotonicity is enforced by appropriately lowering the basis order and performing h-refinement around discontinuities. Convergence results are shown for analytical two- and three-dimensional solutions of diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations that demonstrate exponential convergence of the new method, even for highly distorted elements. Flow simulations for subsonic, transonic and supersonic flows are also presented that demonstrate discretization flexibility using hp-type refinement. Unlike other high-order methods, the new method uses standard finite volume grids consisting of arbitary triangulizations and tetrahedrizations.",

The combination of splitting and incremental pressure is shownto be equivalent to an error-correcting method using the full pressure. In numerical experiments employing a third-order time-integration scheme and various orders for the pressure increment, the splitting error is shown to control the convergence order, and the full order of the scheme is recaptured for both velocity and pressure.

The method uses either the Roe or Van Leer flux-splitting for inviscid terms and central differencing for viscous terms in the explicit operator (residual), and the Steger-Warming (SW) splitting and lower-upper (LU) approximate factorization for the implicit operator. This approach is efficient since the SW-LU combination requires the inversion of only block diagonal matrices, as opposed to the block tridiagonal inversion of the widely used ADI method, and is fully vectorizable. The LU method is particularly advantageous for systems with large number of equations, such as for chemical and thermal nonequilibrium flow. Formulas of the numerical method are presented for the finite-volume discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations in general coordinates. Numerical tests in hypersonic blunt body, ramped-duct, shock wave/boundary layer interaction, and divergent nozzle flows demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the present method. ?? 1992.",

Although Einstein is correct in The Theory of Relativity, light speed travel is contrary to his assumptions. These assumptions, however, are not all-inclusive and an extended theory free of the light-speed restrictions, is presented. As the singular behavior of the relativity factor increases the mass of a light speed vehicle, electric and magnetic charges and currents also increase. This suggests an electromagnetic drive is a viable light speed propulsor and an inverse Lorentz transformation is used to define electromagnetic effects that characterize these interactions. From the fluid perspective, an algorithm for resolving the Navier-Stokes equation is extended by redefining the potential surfaces and integration factors. Viscous and heat transfer terms are embedded within these definitions to provide a more meaningful explanation of vorticity. These transient two-dimensional differential equations more strongly retain the canonical form for subsonic flow as Poisson equations, and supersonic flow where the equations are wave-like. At or near light speed, the relativity singularity may be removed and analytically derived trajectory and fluid results previously suggested that magnetic effects dominate. Newer findings imply that these relations are far more complex at the speed of light than originally proposed.",

The advantage of using the low Mach number equations and their adjoints is that they are appropriate for flows with variable density, such as flames, but do not require resolution of acoustic waves. Two versions of the adjoint are implemented and assessed: a discrete-adjoint and a continuous-adjoint. The most unstable global mode calculated with the discrete-adjoint has exactly the same eigenvalue as the corresponding direct global mode but contains numerical artifacts near the inlet. The most unstable global mode calculated with the continuous-adjoint has no numerical artifacts but a slightly different eigenvalue. The eigenvalues converge, however, as the timestep reduces. Apart from the numerical artifacts, the mode shapes are very similar, which supports the expectation that they are otherwise equivalent. The continuous-adjoint requires less resolution and usually converges more quickly than the discrete-adjoint but is more challenging to implement. Finally, the direct and adjoint global modes are combined in order to calculate the wavemaker region of a low density jet. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

Using a Galerkin finite-element computational method, we are able to obtain solutions capable of describing the raindrop shape along with the associated flow field self-consistently. For drops with diameter d&lt; 1. mm, the drop shape and flow field can be rigorously solved by computing solutions with all the parameters evaluated from the standard known physical properties. For drops of 1. mm ??? d&lt; 1.5. mm, an assumption of viscosity ratio ??= 200 (greater than that of water versus air) seems to be necessary to account for the vortex shedding in the unsteady wake and subsequent reduction of the internal circulation intensity. An additional assumption for adjusting the value of Reynolds number Re is needed to match the drag coefficient value consistent with the measured (known) terminal velocity, for 1.5. mm ??? d??? 5. mm. Now the terminal velocity cannot be determined as part of the solution and Re differs from that evaluated from the actual physical properties. But the flow field might reasonably represent the time-smoothed result of the transient oscillatory flow field that consists of the eddy viscosity. For drops of d&gt; 5. mm, it seems that the adjustment of viscosity ratio ?? in addition to Re enables obtaining the drop shape with axis ratio comparable to experimental data, otherwise the solution would over-estimate the drop deformation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

A space-time discontinuous Galerkin discretization is used in which the spatial meshes remain static in both position and resolution, and in which all elements advance by the same time step. Error estimates are computed using an adjoint-weighted residual, where the discrete adjoint is computed on a finer space obtained by order enrichment of the primal space. An iterative method based on an approximate factorization is used to solve both the forward and adjoint problems. The output error estimate drives a fixed-growth adaptive strategy that employs hanging-node refinement in the spatial domain and slab bisection in the temporal domain. Detection of space-time anisotropy in the localization of the output error is found to be important for efficiency of the adaptive algorithm, and two anisotropy measures are presented: one based on inter-element solution jumps, and one based on projection of the adjoint. Adaptive results are shown for several two-dimensional convection-dominated flows, including the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. For sufficiently-low accuracy levels, output-based adaptation is shown to be advantageous in terms of degrees of freedom when compared to uniform refinement and to adaptive indicators based on approximation error and the unweighted residual. Time integral quantities are used for the outputs of interest, but entire time histories of the integrands are also compared and found to converge rapidly under the proposed scheme. In addition, the final output-adapted space-time meshes are shown to be relatively insensitive to the starting mesh. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

However, with the imposition of the pressure tensor moment constraint, as is fundamentally necessary for the recovery of the Navier-Stokes equations, it is proved that the entropy function must be of the discrete Boltzmann form.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a finite volume fourth-order-accurate compact scheme for discretization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in primitive variable formulation. The numerical method of integrating the Navier–Stokes equations com- prises a compact finite volume formulation of the average convective and diffusive fluxes. The pressure–velocity coupling is achieved via the coupled solution of the resulting system of equations. The solution of the coupled set of equations is per- formed with an implicit Newton–Krylov matrix-free method for stationary problems. For simulation of unsteady flows, a standard fourth-order Runge–Kutta method was used for temporal discretization and the velocity–pressure coupling was ensured at each stage also using the matrix-free method. Several incompressible viscous steady and unsteady flow problems have been computed to assess the robustness and accu- racy of the proposed method.",

The spatial discretization is by non-conforming quadrilateral finite elements which satisfy the LBB condition. The major focus is on the differences in accuracy and efficiency between the backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson and fractional-step theta schemes used in discretizing the momentum equations. Further, the differences between fully coupled solvers and operator-splitting techniques (projection methods) and the influence of the treatment of the nonlinear advection term are considered. The combination of both discrete projection schemes and non-conforming finite elements allows the comparison of schemes which are representative for many methods used in practice. On Cartesian grids this approach encompasses some well-known staggered grid finite difference discretizations too. The results which are obtained for several typical flow problems are thought to be representative and should be helpful for a fair rating of solution schemes, particularly in long-time simulations.",

This turbulence model is based on a blending of the Wilcox k-. ?? model used near the wall and the k-. ?? model used in the rest of the domain where the blending functions depend on the distance to the nearest wall. For the computation of the distance of each quadrature point in the domain to the nearest of the curved, piecewise polynomial wall boundaries, we propose a stabilized continuous finite element (FE) discretization of the eikonal equation. Furthermore, we propose a new wall boundary condition for the dissipation rate ?? based on the projection of the analytic near-wall behavior of ?? onto the discrete ansatz space of the DG discretization. Finally, we introduce an artificial viscosity to the discretization of the turbulence kinetic energy (k-)equation to suppress oscillations of k near the underresolved boundary layer edge.The wall distance computation based on the continuous FE discretization of the eikonal equation is demonstrated for an internal and three external/aerodynamic flow geometries including a three-element high-lift configuration. The DG discretization of the RANS equations with the SST model is demonstrated for turbulent flows past a flat plate and the RAE2822 airfoil (Cases 9 and 10). The results are compared to the underlying k-. ?? model and experimental data. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "Anisotropies occur naturally in computational fluid dynamics where the simulation of small-scale physical phenomena, such as boundary layers at high Reynolds numbers, causes the grid to be highly stretched, leading to a slowdown in convergence of multigrid methods. Several approaches aimed at making multigrid a robust solver have been proposed and analyzed in the literature using the scalar diffusion equation. However, they have rarely been applied to solving more complicated models, such as the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. This paper contains the first published numerical results of the behavior of two popular robust multigrid approaches (alternating-plane smoothers combined with standard coarsening and plane-implicit smoothers combined with semi-coarsening) for solving the 3-D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in the simulation of the driven-cavity and a boundary layer over a flat plate on a stretched grid. Grid size, grid stretching, and Reynolds number are the factors considered in evaluating the robustness of the multi-grid methods. Both approaches yield large increases in convergence rates over cell-implicit smoothers on stretched grids. The combination of plane-implicit smoothers and semi-coarsening was found to be fully robust in the flat-plate simulation up to Reynolds numbers 10^6 and the best alternative in the driven-cavity simulation for Reynolds numbers above 10^3. The alternating-plane approach exhibits a better behavior for lower Reynolds numbers (below 10^3) in the driven-cavity simulation.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we use volume-penalization to mimic the presence of obstacles in a flow or a domain with no-slip boundaries. This allows in principle the use of fast Fourier spectral methods and coherent vortex simulation techniques (based on wavelet decomposition of the flow variables) to compute turbulent wall-bounded flow or flows around solid obstacles by simply adding one term in the equation. Convergence checks are reported using a recently revived, and unexpectedly difficult dipole-wall collision as a benchmark computation. Several quantities, like the vorticity isolines, truncation error, kinetic energy and enstrophy are inspected for a collision of a dipole with a no-slip wall and compared with available benchmark data obtained with a standard Chebyshev pseudospectral method. We quantify the possible deteriorating effects of the Gibbs phenomenon present in the Fourier based schemes due to continuity restrictions of the penalized Navier-Stokes equations on the wall. It is found that Gibbs oscillations have a negligible effect on the flow evolution allowing higher-order recovery of the accuracy on a Fourier basis by means of postprocessing. An advantage of coherent vortex simulations, on the other hand, is that the degrees of freedom of the flow computation can strongly be reduced. In this study, we quantify the possible reduction of degrees of freedom while keeping the accuracy. For an optimal convergence scenario the penalization parameter has to scale with the number of Fourier and wavelet modes. In addition, an implicit treatment of the Darcy drag term in the penalized Navier-Stokes equations is beneficial since this allows one to set the time step independent from the penalization parameter without additional computational or memory requirements. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this research, we introduce a new modelling technique that couples Navier–Stokes equations with protein molecular dynamics to investigate the behaviours of RBC aggregates and their effects on the blood rheology. In essence, the Lagrangian solid mesh, which represents the immersed deformable cells, is set to move on top of a background Eulerian mesh. The effects of cell–cell interaction (adhesive/repulsive) and hydrodynamic forces on RBC aggregates are studied by introducing equivalent protein molecular potentials into the immersed finite element method. The aggregation of red blood cells in quiescent fluids is simulated. The de-aggregation of a RBC cluster at different shear rates is also investigated to provide an explanation of the shear-rate-dependence of the blood viscoelastic properties. Finally, the influences of cell–cell interaction, RBC rigidity, and vessel geometry are addressed in a series of test cases with deformable cells (normal and sickle RBCs) passing through micro- and capillary vessels.",

The pressure segregation is inspired in fractional step schemes, although the converged solution corresponds to that of a monolithic time integration. Finally, the nodal-based implementation is based on an a priori calculation of the integrals appearing in the formulation and then the construction of the matrix and right-hand side vector of the final algebraic system to be solved. After appropriate approximations, this matrix and this vector can be constructed directly for each nodal point, without the need to loop over the elements and thus making the calculations much faster.

Ensembles of data are compiled from the transient solutions computed from the discrete equation system derived from the FDS for the nonstationary Navier-Stokes equations. The optimal orthogonal bases are reconstructed by the elements of the ensemble with POD and SVD. Combining the above procedures with a Galerkin projection approach yields a new optimizing FDS model with lower dimensions and a high accuracy for the nonstationary Navier-Stokes equations. The errors between POD approximate solutions and FDS solutions are analyzed. It is shown by considering the results obtained for numerical simulations of cavity flows that the error between POD approximate solution and FDS solution is consistent with theoretical results. Moreover, it is also shown that this validates the feasibility and efficiency of POD method.",

Each term in the asymptotics is a self-similar divergence-free vector field with Gaussian decay at infinity, and the coefficients in the expansion can be determined by solving a finite system of ordinary differential equations. As a consequence of our results, we are able to characterize the set of solutions for which the velocity field satisfies ||u(.,t)||(L(2)) = o(t(-5/4)) as t--&gt;+ infinity.

The mesh elements can be composed of a set of standard sub-elements belonging to a fine low-order mesh whose cardinality can be freely chosen according to the domain discretization capabilities. The number of mesh sub-elements still have an impact on the cost of numerical integration. Since the agglomerated elements are arbitrarily shaped, physical space orthonormal basis functions are here considered as a key ingredient to build a suitable discrete dG space. As a result we are allowed to perform high-order discretizations on top of the set of (possibly) subparametric sub-cells composing an agglomerated element. Our approach is validated on challenging viscous and inviscid test cases. We demonstrate the use of low-order meshes as a starting point to obtain high-order accurate solutions on coarse meshes. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The method consists in introducing the projection of the pressure gradient and adding the difference between the pressure Laplacian and the divergence of this new field to the incompressibility equation, both multiplied by suitable algorithmic parameters. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss how to deal with the new variable in the implementation of the algorithm. Obviously, it could be treated as one extra unknown, either explicitly or as a condensed variable. However, we take for granted that the only way for the algorithm to be efficient is to uncouple it from the velocity–pressure calculation in one way or another. Here we discuss some iterative schemes to perform this uncoupling of the pressure gradient projection (PGP) from the calculation of the velocity and the pressure, both for the stationary and the transient Navier–Stokes equations. In the first case, the strategies analyzed refer to the interaction of the linearization loop and the iterative segregation of the PGP, whereas in the second the main dilemma concerns the explicit or implicit treatment of the PGP",

The algorithm is based on the method of artificial compressibility and uses a third-order flux-difference splitting technique for the convective terms and the second-order central difference for the viscous terms. The accuracy is obtained in the numerical solutions by subiterating the equations in pseudotime for each physical time step. The equations are solved with a line-relaxation scheme that allows the use of very large pseudotime steps leading to fast convergence for steady-state problems as well as for the subiterations of time-dependent problems. The steady-state solution of flow through a square duct with a 90-deg bend is computed, and the results are compared with experimental data. Good agreement is observed. Computations of unsteady flow over a circular cylinder are presented and compared to other experimental and computational results. Finally, the flow through an artificial heart configuration with moving boundaries is calculated and presented.",

It is basically symmetric, i.e., it can be either positive or negative with fluctuations. Its joint probability density functions with ½|u|2 and with ½|ω|2 are also found to be symmetric, fluctuating at the same times as the probability density function of −u·∇p. A power-law relationship is found in the mathematical bound for the enstrophy growth math+2νP∝(QaPb)α, where Q and P denote the enstrophy and the palinstrophy, respectively, and the exponents a and b are determined by calculus inequalities.

The local projection allows to circumvent the Babuska-Brezzi condition by using equal-order finite element pairs. The local projection can be used to stabilize high equal-order finite element pairs. The proposed method combines the local projection stabilization method and the two-level method under the assumption of the uniqueness condition. The two-level method consists of solving a nonlinear equation on the coarse mesh and solving a linear equation on fine mesh. The nonlinear equation is solved by the one-step Newtonian iteration method. In the rest of this article, we show the error analysis of the lowest equal-order finite element pair and provide convergence rate of approximate solutions. Furthermore, the numerical illustrations coincide with the theoretical analysis expectations.

By utilizing the incompressibility constraint to remove the trace from the deviatoric stress tensor, we eliminate second-order cross-derivatives of the velocity field, simplifying and improving the accuracy of co-located discretization techniques on both structured- and unstructured grids. This formulation improves the performance of SIMPLE-type algorithms that use sequential mass-momentum iterations to enforce incompressibility. A trace-free stress tensor also removes a typical source of net-rotation for simulations employing free-slip boundary conditions in spherical geometry. We implement the new scheme as a modification of an existing Boussinesq convection code, which we benchmark against analytical solutions of the Stokes problem in a spherical shell with both constant and radially dependent viscosity, and time-dependent thermal convection at infinite Prandtl number with large viscosity contrasts. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",

Fourth-order finite-volume stencils are employed for spatially discretizing various operators in the context of structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Time integration adopts a fourth-order, semi-implicit, additive Runge-Kutta method to treat the non-stiff convection term explicitly and the stiff diffusion term implicitly. The divergence-free condition is fulfilled by an approximate projection operator. Altogether, these components yield a simple algorithm for simulating incompressible viscous flows on periodic domains with fourth-order accuracies both in time and in space. Results of numerical tests show that the proposed method is superior to previous second-order methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. A major contribution of this work is the analysis of a fourth-order approximate projection operator. ?? 2013 IMACS.",

The algorithm is applied to both the discrete-adjoint and the discrete flow-sensitivity methods for calculating the gradient of the objective function. The adjoint and flow-sensitivity equations are solved using a novel preconditioned generalized minimum residual (GMRES) strategy. Together with a complete linearization of the discretized Navier–Stokes and turbulence model equations, this results in an accurate and efficient evaluation of the gradient. Furthermore, fast flow solutions are obtained using the same preconditioned GMRES strategy in conjunction with an inexact Newton approach. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated for several design examples, including inverse design, lift-constrained drag minimization,lift enhancement, and maximization of lift-to-drag ratio. In all examples, the norm of the gradient is reduced by several orders of magnitude, indicating that a local minimum has been obtained. By the use of the adjoint method, the gradient is obtained in from one-fifth to one-half of the time required to converge a flow solution.",

          "abstract": "Some known results regarding the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations were obtained by different authors. Existence and smoothness of solution for the Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions have been known for a long time. Leray $\cite{jL34}$ showed that the Navier-Stokes equations in three space dimensions have a weak solution. Scheffer $\cite{vS76}, \cite{vS93}$ and Shnirelman $\cite{aS97}$ obtained weak solution of the Euler equations with compact support in spacetime. Caffarelli, Kohn and Nirenberg $\cite{CKN82}$ improved Scheffer&#039;s results, and F.-H. Lin $\cite{fL98}$ simplified the proof of the results of J. Leray. Many problems and conjectures about behavior of weak solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are described in the books of Ladyzhenskaya $\cite{oL69}$, Bertozzi and Majda $\cite{BM02}$, Temam $\cite{RT77}$, Constantin $\cite{pC01}$ or Lemari\&#039;e-Rieusset $\cite{pL02}$. Solutions of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations with initial conditions (Cauchy problem) for 2D and 3D cases were obtained in the convergence series form by analytical iterative method using Fourier and Laplace transforms in paper $\cite{TT10}$. These solutions were received in a form of infinitely differentiable functions. That allowed us to analyze all aspects of the problem on a much deeper level and with more details. For several combinations of problem parameters numerical results were obtained and presented as graphs $\cite{TT10}$,$\;\cite{TT11}$. This paper describes detailed proof of existence and uniqueness of the solution of the Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier- Stokes equations with any smooth initial velocity. This solution satisfies the conditions required in $\cite{CF06}$ for the problem of Navier-Stokes equations and when viscosity tends to zero this proof is correct for the Euler equations too.",

          "abstract": "It is well known that any spatial discretization of the saddle-point Stokes problem should satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya-Brezzi-Babuska (LBB) stability condition in order to prevent the appearance of spurious pressure modes. Particularly, if an equal-order approximation is applied, the Schur complement (or, as called some times, the Uzawa matrix) of the pressure system has a non-trivial null space that gives rise to such modes. An idea in the past was that all the schemes that solve a Poission equation for the pressure rather than the Uzawa pressure equation (splitting/projection methods) should overcome this difficulty; this idea was wrong. There is numerical evidence that at least the so-called incremental projection scheme still suffers from spurious pressure oscillations if an equal-order approximation is applied. The present paper tries to distinguish which projection requires LBB-compliant approximation and which does not. Moreover, a stabilized version of the incremental projection scheme is derived. Proper bounds for the stabilization parameter are also given. The numerical results show that the stabilized scheme does indeed achieve second-order accuracy and does not produce spurious (node to node) pressure oscillations.

It is seen that application of existing iteration methods for the non-linear equation - suitably adjointed - has a property of guaranteed convergence provided that the non-linear iteration is well behaved. For situations where this is not the case, in particular for strongly separated flows, a stabilization technique based on the Recursive Projection Method is developed. This method additionally provides the dominant eigenmodes of the problem, allowing identification of flow regions that are unstable under the basic iteration. These are found to be regions of separated flow. Finally, an adjoint-based optimization with 96 design variables is performed on a wing-body configuration.

          "abstract": "The flow in a two-dimensional laminar separation bubble is analyzed by means of finite-difference solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible flow. The study was motivated by the need to analyze high-Reynolds-number flow fields having viscous regions in which the boundary-layer assumptions are questionable. The approach adopted in the present study is to analyze the flow in the immediate vicinity of the separation bubble using the Navier–Stokes equations. It is assumed that the resulting solutions can then be patched to the remainder of the flow field, which is analyzed using boundary-layer theory and inviscid-flow analysis. Some of the difficulties associated with patching the numerical solutions to the remainder of the flow field are discussed, and a suggestion for treating boundary conditions is made which would permit a separation bubble to be computed from the Navier–Stokes equations using boundary conditions from inviscid and boundary-layer solutions without accounting for interaction between individual flow regions. Numerical solutions are presented for separation bubbles having Reynolds numbers (based on momentum thickness) of the order of 50. In these numerical solutions, separation was found to occur without any evidence of the singular behaviour at separation found in solutions to the boundary-layer equations. The numerical solutions indicate that predictions of separation by boundary-layer theory are not reliable for this range of Reynolds number. The accuracy and validity of the numerical solutions are briefly examined. Included in this examination are comparisons between the Howarth solution of the boundary-layer equations for a linearly retarded freestream velocity and the corresponding numerical solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations for various Reynolds numbers.",

Central differencing is used in all discretizations. The momentum equations are integrated explicitly after the solution of a Poisson pressure equation that enforces mass conservation. Richardson extrapolation is employed to estimate the correct solutions in cases without precise reference solutions. For both forms of the problem, the staggered and the cell-center collocated meshes are shown to produce comparably accurate results, while the vertex collocated mesh shows poorer accuracy. The almost unknown semistaggered mesh, which is too sensitive to the velocity discontinuity in the traditional cavity problem, appears as the most accurate mesh in the regularized cavity problem.",

Solutions of these ODEs for the transverse-averaged dependent variables are then utilized to develop the difference scheme. The discrete variables are scalar velocities and pressure, averaged over the faces of brick-like cells in the (x,y,t) space. Cell-interior variation of transverse-averaged pressure in each spatial direction is quadratic. Cell-interior variation of transverse-averaged velocity in each spatial direction is a sum of a constant, a linear and an exponential term. Due to the introduction of delayed coefficients, the exponential functions are to be evaluated only once at each time step. The semi-implicit scheme has inherent upwinding. Results of applications to several test problems show that the scheme is very robust and leads to a second-order error. As expected in such coarse-mesh schemes, even relatively large size cells lead to small errors. Extension to three dimensions is straightforward. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The method assumes a spectral discretization at the stochastic level involving a orthogonal basis of random functionals (such as Polynomial Chaos or stochastic multi-wavelets bases). The Newton method uses the unsteady equations to derive a linear equation for the stochastic Newton increments. This linear equation is subsequently solved following a matrix-free strategy, where the iterations consist in performing integrations of the linearized unsteady Navier-Stokes equations, with an appropriate time scheme to allow for a decoupled integration of the stochastic modes. Various examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the method in determining stochastic steady solution, even for regimes where it is likely unstable. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "Velocity measurements conducted with particle image velocimetry (PIV) often exhibit regions where the flow motion cannot be evaluated. The principal reasons for this are the absence of seeding particles or limited optical access for illumination or imaging. Additional causes can be laser light reflections and unwanted out-of-focus effects. As a consequence, the velocity field measured with PIV contains regions where no velocity information is available, that is gaps. This work investigates the suitability of using the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to obtain accurate estimates of the local transient velocity field in small gaps; the present approach applies to time-resolved two-dimensional experiments of incompressible flows. The numerics are based on a finite volume discretization with partitioned time-stepping to solve the governing equations. The measured velocity distribution at the gap boundary is taken as time-varying boundary condition, and an approximate initial condition inside the gap is obtained via low-order spatial interpolation of the velocity at the boundaries. The influence of this I.C. is seen to diminish over time, as information is convected through the gap. Due to the form of the equations, no initial or boundary conditions on the pressure are required. The approach is evaluated by a time-resolved experiment where the true solution is known a priori. The results are compared with a boundary interpolation approach. Finally, an application of the technique to an experiment with a gap of complex shape is presented.",

The tensorial SNS equations proposed is the simplest in form and is applicable to flow fields with arbitrary body boundaries.  The zones of influence and dependence of the SNS equations, which are of primary importance to numerical solutions, are expounded for the first time from the viewpoint of subcharacteristics.  Besides, a detailed analysis of the diffusion process in flow fields shows that the diffusion effect has an influence zone globally windward and an upwind propagation greatly depressed by convection.  The maximum upwind influential distance of the viscous effect and the relative importance of the viscous effect in the flow direction to that in the direction normal to the flow are represented by the Reynolds number, which illustrates the conversion of the complete Navier-Stokes (NS) equations to the SNS equations for flows with large Reynolds number.",

          "abstract": "This paper focuses on the theoretical treatment of the laminar, incompressible, and time-dependent flow of a viscous fluid in a porous channel with orthogonally moving walls. Assuming uniform injection or suction at the porous walls, two cases are considered for which the opposing walls undergo either uniform or nonuniform motions. For the first case, we follow Dauenhauer and Majdalani [Phys. Fluids 15, 1485 (2003)] by taking the wall expansion ratio alpha to be time invariant and then proceed to reduce the Navier-Stokes equations into a fourth order ordinary differential equation with four boundary conditions. Using the homotopy analysis method (HAM), an optimized analytical procedure is developed that enables us to obtain highly accurate series approximations for each of the multiple solutions associated with this problem. By exploring wide ranges of the control parameters, our procedure allows us to identify dual or triple solutions that correspond to those reported by Zaturska [Fluid Dyn. Res. 4, 151 (1988)]. Specifically, two new profiles are captured that are complementary to the type I solutions explored by Dauenhauer and Majdalani. In comparison to the type I motion, the so-called types II and III profiles involve steeper flow turning streamline curvatures and internal flow recirculation. The second and more general case that we consider allows the wall expansion ratio to vary with time. Under this assumption, the Navier-Stokes equations are transformed into an exact nonlinear partial differential equation that is solved analytically using the HAM procedure. In the process, both algebraic and exponential models are considered to describe the evolution of alpha(t) from an initial alpha(0) to a final state alpha(1). In either case, we find the time-dependent solutions to decay very rapidly to the extent of recovering the steady state behavior associated with the use of a constant wall expansion ratio. We then conclude that the time-dependent variation of the wall expansion ratio plays a secondary role that may be justifiably ignored. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

          "abstract": "For the three-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, we present a formula- tion featuring velocity, vorticity and helical density as independent variables. We find the helical density can be observed as a Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the divergence- free constraint on the vorticity variable, similar to the pressure in the case of the incom- pressibility condition for velocity. As one possible practical application of this new formu- lation, we consider a time-splitting numerical scheme based on an alternating procedure between vorticity–helical density and velocity–Bernoulli pressure systems of equations. Results of numerical experiments include a comparison with some well-known schemes based on pressure–velocity formulation and illustrate the competitiveness on the new scheme as well as the soundness of the new formulation.",

The convection terms are discretized with a fifth-order-accurate upwind compact difference approximation, the viscous terms are discretized with a sixth-order symmetrical compact difference approximation, the continuity equation and the pressure gradient in the momentum equations are discretized with a fourth-order difference approximation on a cell-centered mesh. Time advancement uses a three-stage Runge–Kutta method. The Poisson equation for computing the pressure is solved with preconditioning.

We introduce here a complete formulation using a modal basis which has been implemented in a new codeNεκTαr. The new basis has the following properties: Jacobi polynomials of mixed weights; semi-orthogonality; hierarchical structure; generalized tensor (warped) product; variable order; and a new apex co-ordinate system allowing automated integration with Gaussian quadrature. We have discussed the formulation using a matrix notation which allows for an easy interpretation of the forward and backward transformations. We use this notation to formulate the linear advection and Helmholtz equations in an efficient manner and show that we recover the following properties: well conditioned matrices; asymptotic operation count of O(N3); scaling O(N2 of the spectral radius of the weak convective operator; and exponential convergence using polynomials up to ∼ 40. Having constructed and numerically analysed these equations we are then able to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a high-order splitting scheme. We demonstrate a variety of results showing exponential convergence using both deformed and straight triangular subdomains for both the Stokes and Navier-Stokes problems.",

Unlike our approach for the case of linear elastodynamics, we cannot employ a fixed-point argument on the nonlinear system itself, and are instead forced to regularize it by a particular parabolic artificial viscosity term. We proceed to show that with this specific regularization, we obtain a time interval of existence which is independent of the artificial viscosity; together with a priori estimates, we identify the global solution (in both phases), as well as the interface motion, as a weak limit in srong norms of our sequence of regularized problems.",

On the other hand, recent studies indicate that the theory of continuum breaks down only at the nanometer level; consequently flows through nanotubes still can be investigated with Navier-Stokes equations if we take suitable boundary conditions into account. The aim of this paper is to study the statics and dynamics of liquids in nanotubes by using methods of nonlinear continuum mechanics. We assume that the nanotube is filled with only a liquid phase; by using a second gradient theory the static profile of the liquid density in the tube is analytically obtained and compared with the profile issued from molecular dynamics simulation. Inside the tube there are two domains: a thin layer near the solid wall where the liquid density is non-uniform and a central core where the liquid density is uniform. In the dynamic case a closed form analytic solution seems to be no more possible, but by a scaling argument it is shown that, in the tube, two distinct domains connected at their frontiers still exist. The thin inhomogeneous layer near the solid wall can be interpreted in relation with the Navier length when the liquid slips on the boundary as it is expected by experiments and molecular dynamics calculations.",

A semi-implicit projection method is utilized for the temporal approximation and for decoupling the velocity field from the pressure field. A series of elliptic boundary value problems arises from the above procedure, each of which is spatially discretized by a weak collocation method in multiple nonoverlapping subdomains. In particular, a modified variational formulation of the partial differential equations is presented which leads, after discretization, to a weak multidomain approximation of the corresponding problems. A weak formalism for the influence matrix technique is also developed, which is consistent with the spatial discretization scheme and successfully separate the equations for the internal nodes from the ones governing the interface unknowns. A method of dealing with the singularity problem faced by the weak formulation at axisymmetric problems is proposed, while a combination of direct methods is studied for tackling effectively the linear algebraic systems resulting from the full discretization. Exponential convergence is demonstrated for a plethora of Stokes and Navier-Stokes simulations. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The cases of reducing a determining system to one or two equations are described.

Periodic (both in spatial coordinates and in time) and some other solutions that are expressed in terms of elementary functions are described.

First we discuss two different scaling limits in which solutions of the steady Boltzmann equation have an asymptotic behavior described by the steady Navier-Stokes Fourier system. Whether this system includes the viscous heating term depends on the ratio of the Froude number to the Mach number of the gas flow. While the steady Navier-Stokes equations with smooth divergence-free external force always have at least one smooth solutions, the Boltzmann equation with the same external force set in the torus, or in a bounded domain with specular reflection of gas molecules at the boundary may fail to have any solution, unless the force field is identically zero. Viscous heating seems to be of key importance in this situation. The nonexistence of any steady solution of the Boltzmann equation in this context seems related to the increase of temperature for the evolution problem, a phenomenon that we have established with the help of numerical simulations on the Boltzmann equation and the BGK model.",

The problems are modeled by p-type Navier-Stokes equations, the extra stress tensor follows a p-power rule (p-NS). The aim of this paper is to present an efficient way for discretizing the governing equations by an LDG method, choosing both equal and mixed order local polynomial space for velocity and pressure. The velocity gradient is introduced as an auxiliary variable and the p-NS system is decomposed into a first order system including the projection of the nonlinear stress tensor components to the local discontinuous space. Every equation resulting from the splitting of the extra stress tensor is discretized under the DG element by element technique. In the divergence constraint equation, an artificial compressibility term (time derivative of the pressure with a small parameter) is added and the first order terms are expressed in a divergence form, and are discretized by utilizing the Lax-Friedrichs numerical fluxes. An upwind wave analysis is applied on the outflow boundary for constructing artificial outflow boundary conditions. For the time discretization, s-stage Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta schemes are applied. Numerical experiments on problems with known exact solutions are performed for verifying the expected convergence rates of the method. Benchmark problems are considered in order to check the performance of the method for solving flow problems described by p-NS systems. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

The higher-order accuracy in time results from 1) An application of the backward differentiation formulae time-stepping algorithm (BDF) in conjunction with 2) A BDF-like extrapolation technique for certain components of the nonlinear terms (which makes use of nonlinear solves unnecessary), as well as 3) A novel application of the Douglas-Gunn splitting (which greatly facilitates handling of boundary conditions while preserving higher-order accuracy in time). As suggested by our theoretical analysis of the algorithms for a variety of special cases, an extensive set of numerical experiments clearly indicate that all of the BDF-based ADI algorithms proposed in this paper are &quot;quasi-unconditionally stable&quot; in the following sense: each algorithm is stable for all couples (h, ??t) of spatial and temporal mesh sizes in a problem-dependent rectangular neighborhood of the form (0, Mh)??(0, Mt). In other words, for each fixed value of ??t below a certain threshold, the Navier-Stokes solvers presented in this paper are stable for arbitrarily small spatial mesh-sizes. The second-order formulation has further been rigorously shown to be unconditionally stable for linear hyperbolic and parabolic equations in two-dimensional space. Although implicit ADI solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations with nominal second-order of temporal accuracy have been proposed in the past, the algorithms presented in this paper are the first ADI-based Navier-Stokes solvers for which second-order or better accuracy has been verified in practice under non-trivial (non-periodic) boundary conditions.",

Model results for run-up distance, water depth, and near-bed velocity are highly correlated (r2 &gt; 0.97) with ensemble-averaged dam-break-driven swash data. Moreover, modeled bed shear stresses are within 20% of estimates derived from measured velocity profiles. Dam-break-driven swash simulations are conducted to determine the effect of foreshore characteristics (bed roughness and foreshore slope) on bore-induced swash-zone hydrodynamics and bed shear stresses. Numerical results revealed that the boundary layer vanishes during flow reversal, grows during the backwash, and becomes depth limited at the end of the swash cycle. In general, the uprush experiences larger shear stresses but for a shorter duration than the backwash. Some variability in this pattern is observed depending on the bed roughness, foreshore slope, and cross-slope location in the swash zone, implying that large spatial gradients in shear stresses can occur on the foreshore. The mean tangential force per unit area supplied to the bed is offshore directed for the simulated cases, with the exception of the mild-slope (1:25) cases, owing to the skewed nature of swash flows. The temporal evolution of the momentum balance inside the swash zone shows an important contribution to the total force from turbulence and advection at the early/final stage of the swash cycle, whereas the local acceleration does not appear to be a significant contribution.",

During the last years a lot of effort has been dedicated to finding a unified approach for compressible and incompressible flow in order to treat fluid dynamic problems with a very wide range of Mach and Reynolds numbers [10,26,37]. On the other hand, SUPG finite element formulation and GMRES implicit solver is one of the most robust combinations to solve state of the art CFD problems [1,6,9,22,29,30,31]. The selection of a good preconditioner and its performance on parallel architecture is another open problem in CFD community. The local feature of the preconditioner presented here means that no communication among processors is needed when working on parallel architectures. Due to these facts we consider that this research can make some contributions towards the development of a unified fluid dynamic model with high rates of convergence for any combination of Mach and Reynolds numbers, being very suitable for massively parallel computations. Finally, it is important to remark that while this kind of preconditioning produces stabilized results in nearly incompressible regimes the standard version exhibits some numerical drawbacks that lead to solutions without physical meaning.",

Several examples of both reacting and non-reacting propulsion-related flowfields are considered. In all cases, convergence that is superior to conventional methods is demonstrated. Accuracy is verified using the example of a backward facing step. These results demonstrate that preconditioning can enhance the capability of density-based methods over a wide range of Mach and Reynolds numbers.",

It is shown that the control of div(u/vertical bar u vertical bar) in a suitable L (t/p) (L (x/q) ) norm is enough to ensure global regularity. The result is reminiscent of the criterion in terms of the direction of the vorticity, introduced first by Constantin and Fefferman. However, in this case the condition is not on the vorticity but on the velocity itself. The proof, based on very standard methods, relies on a straightforward relation between the divergence of the direction of the velocity and the growth of energy along streamlines.",

A finite volume formulation of the LCL that incorporates geometric corrections for fracture undulation is presented. Simulations of fluid flow through planar fractures with sinusoidal variation in aperture were compared to published results. The rough-walled fracture simulations demonstrated that the total flow rates predicted by the corrected LCL were within 10% of those predicted by the Stokes equations for all the fractures examined in this work. Differences between the NS and Stokes simulations clearly demonstrated that inertial forces can significantly influence the internal flow field within a fracture and the total flow rate across a fracture. By limiting the total flow rate differences between the NS and Stokes simulations, constraints for three kinematic parameters were determined. For all the fractures presented in this work, the corrected LCL was determined to be an acceptable approximation to the NS equations, provided that the kinematic and geometric constraints were met.",

In this research, we introduce a new modelling technique that couples Navier-Stokes equations with protein molecular dynamics to investigate the behaviours of RBC aggregates and their effects on the blood rheology. In essence, the Lagrangian solid mesh, which represents the immersed deformable cells, is set to move on top of a background Eulerian mesh. The effects of cell-cell interaction (adhesive/repulsive) and hydrodynamic forces on RBC aggregates are studied by introducing equivalent protein molecular potentials into the immersed finite element method. The aggregation of red blood cells in quiescent fluids is simulated. The de-aggregation of a RBC cluster at different shear rates is also investigated to provide an explanation of the shear-rate-dependence of the blood viscoelastic properties. Finally, the influences of cell-cell interaction, RBC rigidity, and vessel geometry are addressed in a series of test cases with deformable cells (normal and sickle RBCs) passing through micro- and capillary vessels.

          "abstract": "Quasi-stationary, or metastable, states play an important role in two-dimensional turbulent fluid flows where they often emerge on time-scales much shorter than the viscous time scale, and then dominate the dynamics for very long time intervals. In this paper we give a dynamical systems explanation of the metastability of an explicit family of solutions, referred to as bar states, of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on the torus. These states are physically relevant because they are associated with certain maximum entropy solutions of the Euler equations, and they have been observed as one type of metastable state in numerical studies of two-dimensional turbulence. For small viscosity (high Reynolds number), these states are quasi-stationary in the sense that they decay on the slow, viscous timescale. Linearization about these states leads to a time-dependent operator. Using the so-called hypocoercive properties of the linearized operator, it is shown that there is an invariant subspace on which this operator produces decay at a rate much faster than the viscous convergence rate. Thus, we provide rigorous justification in this context for the existence of multiple time-scales in the evolution of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on the torus and for the role that stationary solutions of the Euler equations play in serving as metastable states.",

In these flows, the mean free path of the gas can be comparable to the characteristic length of the microchannel, leading to strong diffusion-enhanced transport of momentum. Numerical solutions to the extended Navier–Stokes equations (ENSE) have successfully modeled such microchannel flows. Analytical solutions to the ENSE for the pressure and velocity fields using the Lambert W function are derived. We find that diffusive contributions to the total transport are only dominant for low average pressures and low pressure drops across the microchannel. For large inlet pressures, we show that the expressions involving the Lambert W function predict steep gradients in the pressure and velocity localized near the channel exit. We extract a characteristic length for this boundary layer. Our analytical results are validated by numerical and experimental results available in the literature.",

The feed stream in the tube, which flows mainly tangentially to the porous wall, is modelled by the Navier-Stokes equations. A method of coupling the Navier-Stokes and the Darcy equations in a solution scheme was considered to develop a fluid dynamic model of crossflow filtration.

For some of these methods a formal analogy with well known time advancing schemes, such as the projection Chorin--Temam&#039;s, can be pointed out. Features and limits of this analogy (that was earlier introduced in B. Perot, J. Comp. Phys. 108 (1993) 51--58) are addressed.

The normal component of velocity is zero on the boundary. We first construct a high-order approximate solution that exhibits a boundary layer. The main contribution to the layer appears in the tangential velocity and is of width $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ and amplitude $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$. Next we prove that the approximate solution stays close to the exact Navier-Stokes solution on a fixed time interval independent of $\epsilon$. As an immediate corollary we show that the Navier–Stokes solution converges in $L^\infty$ in the small viscosity limit to the solution of the compressible Euler equations with normal velocity equal to zero on the boundary.",

We attempt to reconstruct the small scale by incorporating the large-scale solution as known forcing into the equations governing the evolution of the small scale. We want to find the smallest value of k(c) for which the time evolution of the large scale sets up the dissipative structures so that the small scale is determined to a significant degree. Existing theory based on energy estimates gives a pessimistic estimate for k(c) that is inversely proportional to the smallest length scale of the flow. At this value of k(c) the energy in the small scale is exponentially small. In contrast, numerical calculations indicate that k(c) can often be chosen remarkably small. We attempt to explain why the time evolution of a relatively few number of large-scale modes can be used to reconstruct the small-scale modes in many situations.

These grids are then overlapped with a large Cartesian cell which is subdivided recursively until the Cartesian cells which are intersected by the outer boundaries of the Quad grids have similar grid resolutions to the Quad cells. The final computational grid is then automatically produced through cell cutting. A Quadtree data structure has been used to store the grids. As a result, grid refinement and coarsening are trivial to accomplish. A cell-centred, second-order accurate viscous flow solver has been developed. The flow solver supports arbitrary control volumes. Solution-based grid adaptations are carried out after converged solutions are obtained on a given grid. Grid independent inviscid and viscous solutions have been obtained through automatic grid adaptations. The overall solution procedure integrates grid generation, grid adaptation and flow solver into an automated computing environment to achieve maximum efficiency and accuracy with minimum human and computer resources.",

This proposed method solves a smaller system of nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations on the coarse mesh and needs to solve the Oseen-type linearized equations of motion only once on the fine mesh level. Within the proposed two-level framework, a prolongation operator, which is required to linearize the convective terms at the fine mesh level using the convergent Navier-Stokes solutions computed at the coarse mesh level, is rigorously derived to increase the prediction accuracy. This indispensable prolongation operator can properly communicate the flow velocities between the two mesh levels because it is locally analytic. Solution convergence can therefore be accelerated. For the sake of numerical accuracy, momentum equations are discretized by employing the general solution for the two-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction model equation. The convective instability problem can be simultaneously eliminated thanks to the proper treatment of convective terms. The converged solution is, thus, very high in accuracy as well as in yielding a quadratic spatial rate of convergence. For the sake of programming simplicity and computational efficiency, pressure gradient terms are rigorously discretized within the explicit framework in the non-staggered grid system. The proposed analytical prolongation operator for the mapping of solutions from the coarse to fine meshes and the explicit pressure gradient discretization scheme, which accommodates the dispersion-relation-preserving property, have been both rigorously justified from the predicted Navier-Stokes solutions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Pressure filtering schemes, which are capable of recovering useful pressures from otherwise polluted numerical results, are developed for two particular elements in two-dimensions and one element in three-dimensions. The automatic pressure filter associated with the penalty method is also explained.

          "abstract": "In this paper we establish a number of implications between various qualitative and quantitative versions of the global regularity problem for the Navier-Stokes equations, in the periodic, smooth finite energy, smooth $H^1$, Schwartz, or mild $H^1$ categories, and with or without a forcing term. In particular, we show that if one has global well-posedness in $H^1$ for the periodic Navier-Stokes problem with a forcing term, then one can obtain global regularity both for periodic and for Schwartz initial data (thus yielding a positive answer to both official formulations of the problem for the Clay Millennium Prize), and can also obtain global smooth solutions from smooth $H^1$ data, and global almost smooth solutions from smooth finite energy data. Our main new tools are localised energy and enstrophy estimates to the Navier-Stokes equation that are applicable for large data or long times, and which may be of independent interest.",

Instead of the original projection methods (denoted as algorithms I and II in this paper), in which the updated cell center velocity from the intermediate velocity and the pressure gradient is not guaranteed solenoidal, the consistent projection methods (denoted as algorithms III and IV) obtain the cell center velocity based on an interpolation from a conservative fluxes with velocity unit on surrounding cell faces. Dependent on treatment of the continuous surface force, the pressure gradient in algorithm III or the sum of the pressure gradient and the surface force in algorithm IV at a cell center is then conducted from the difference between the updated velocity and the intermediate velocity in a consistent projection method. A non-viscous 3D static drop with serials of density ratios is numerically simulated. Using the consistent projection methods, the spurious currents can be greatly reduced and the pressure jump across the interface can be accurately captured without oscillations. The developed consistent projection method are also applied for simulation of interface evolution of an initial ellipse driven by the surface tension and of an initial sphere bubble driven by the buoyancy with good accuracy and good resolution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The method consists of a generalized implicit scheme which has been linearized by Taylor expansion about the solution at the known time level to produce a set of coupled linear difference equations which are valid for a given time step. To solve these difference equations, the Douglas-Gunn procedure for generating alternating-direction implicit (ADI) schemes as perturbations of fundamental implicit difference schemes is employed. The resulting sequence of narrow block-banded systems can be solved efficiently by standard block-elimination methods. The method is a one-step method, as opposed to a predictor-corrector method, and requires no iteration to compute the solution for a single time step. Test calculations are presented for a three-dimensional application to subsonic flow in a straight duct with rectangular cross section. Stability is demonstrated for time steps which are orders of magnitude larger than the maximum allowable time step for conditionally stable methods as determined by the well-known CFL condition. The computational effort per time step is discussed and is very approximately only twice that of most explicit methods. The accuracy of computed solutions is examined by mesh refinement and comparison with other analytical and experimental results.",

In this paper we recast the incompressible (constant density) Navier-Stokes equations (with the velocity prescribed at the boundary) as an equivalent system, for the primary variables velocity and pressure. We do this in the usual way away from the boundaries, by replacing the incompressibility condition on the velocity by a Poisson equation for the pressure. The key difference from the usual approaches occurs at the boundaries, where we use boundary conditions that unequivocally allow the pressure to be recovered from knowledge of the velocity at any fixed time. This avoids the common difficulty of an, apparently, over-determined Poisson problem. Since in this alternative formulation the pressure can be accurately and efficiently recovered from the velocity, the recast equations are ideal for numerical marching methods. The new system can be discretized using a variety of methods, in principle to any desired order of accuracy. In this work we illustrate the approach with a 2-D second order finite difference scheme on a Cartesian grid, and devise an algorithm to solve the equations on domains with curved (non-conforming) boundaries, including a case with a non-trivial topology (a circular obstruction inside the domain). This algorithm achieves second order accuracy (in L-infinity), for both the velocity and the pressure. The scheme has a natural extension to 3-D.",

Nevertheless, the uncertainty due to spatial discretization limits the confidence of practitioners in numerical solutions. An approach to provide information about the accuracy of the quantity of interest is proposed here-in. The novel a posteriori error estimation technique - the bound method - is based on relaxing Lagrange multipliers that enforces continuity between sub-domains. The method provides fast, efficient, asymptotic but reliable lower and upper bounds to the output of underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Herein, we highlight the method when applied to outputs of the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes and Energy equations. The bound method in this paper follows the directly equilibrated hybrid-flux approach for the flux calculation between sub-domains and uses the Crouzeix-Raviart (P2
+ - P1) approximation spaces. To improve the effectiveness of the bound method, an adaptive sub-domain refinement strategy leading to sharper bounds is adopted. A convective heat transfer problem in a series of electronic chip devices is investigated. The novelty of this paper is to present bounds using adaptive domain decomposition for outputs associated to a complex three-dimensional field solution of the Navier-Stokes and Energy equations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The first task of this paper is to apply the approach of Doering and Foias \cite{DF} to the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations on a periodic domain $[0,L]^{2}$ by estimating quantities of physical relevance, particularly long-time averages $\left&lt;\cdot\right&gt;$, in terms of the Reynolds number $\Rey = U\ell/\nu$, where $U^{2}= L^{-2}\left&lt;\|\bu\|_{2}^{2}\right&gt;$ and $\ell$ is the forcing scale. In particular, the Constantin-Foias-Temam upper bound \cite{CFT} on the attractor dimension converts to $a_{\ell}^{2}\Rey(1 + \ln\Rey)^{1/3}$, while the estimate for the inverse Kraichnan length is $(a_{\ell}^{2}\Rey)^{1/2}$, where $a_{\ell}$ is the aspect ratio of the forcing. Other inverse length scales, based on time averages, and associated with higher derivatives, are estimated in a similar manner. The second task is to address the issue of intermittency : it is shown how the time axis is broken up into very short intervals on which various quantities have lower bounds, larger than long time-averages, which are themselves interspersed by longer, more quiescent, intervals of time.",

          "abstract": "A detailed study is carried out for the relativistic theory of viscoelasticity which was recently constructed on the basis of Onsager&#039;s linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. After rederiving the theory using a local argument with the entropy current, we show that this theory universally reduces to the standard relativistic Navier-Stokes fluid mechanics in the long time limit. Since effects of elasticity are taken into account, the dynamics at short time scales is modified from that given by the Navier-Stokes equations, so that acausal problems intrinsic to relativistic Navier-Stokes fluids are significantly remedied. We in particular show that the wave equations for the propagation of disturbance around a hydrostatic equilibrium in Minkowski spacetime become symmetric hyperbolic for some range of parameters, so that the model is free of acausality problems. This observation suggests that the relativistic viscoelastic model with such parameters can be regarded as a causal completion of relativistic Navier-Stokes fluid mechanics. By adjusting parameters to various values, this theory can treat a wide variety of materials including elastic materials, Maxwell materials, Kelvin-Voigt materials and (a nonlinearly generalized version of) simplified Israel-Stewart fluids, and thus we expect the theory to be the most universal description of single-component relativistic continuum materials. We also show that the presence of strains and the corresponding change in temperature are naturally unified through the Tolman law in a generally covariant description of continuum mechanics.",

For the sake of numerical accuracy, dispersion-relation-preserving upwind scheme developed within the two-dimensional context was employed to approximate the convection terms. The validity of the proposed mass-preserving Navier–Stokes method is justified by solving two benchmark problems at high Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers. Based on the simulated Navier–Stokes solutions, the proposed formulation is shown to outperform the conventional segregated method in terms of the reduction of CPU time.",

The novelty of these methods resides in how the reduced order models are formed, that is, how the coefficients of the POD expansions are calculated. Rather than taking a standard approach of projecting the underlying equations onto the reduced space through a Galerkin projection, here two different techniques are employed. The first method applies a second order Taylor series to calculate the POD coefficients at each time step from the POD coefficients at earlier time steps. The second method uses a Smolyak sparse grid collocation method to calculate the POD coefficients, where again the coefficients at earlier time steps are used as the inputs. The advantage of both approaches are that they are non-intrusive and so do not require modifications to a system code; they are therefore very easy to implement. They also provide accurate solutions for modelling flow problems, and this has been demonstrated by the simulation of flows past a cylinder and within a gyre. It is demonstrated that accuracy relative to the high fidelity model is maintained whilst CPU times are reduced by several orders of magnitude in comparison to high fidelity models.",

The method works independently of the underlying spatial mesh; therefore, it can be easily integrated into structured or unstructured codes. The additional computational cost is minimal, and a significant increase of the time step is achieved without losing accuracy. The effectiveness and robustness of the method are demonstrated on both a Cartesian staggered and an unstructured collocated formulation.

Mach 10 flow around a cylinder and Mach 12.7 flow over a flat plate are simulated using both computational fluid dynamics using the temperature jump BCs of Patterson and Smoluchowski and the direct simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC) method. These flows exhibit such strongly non-equilibrium behaviour that, following Patterson&#039;s analysis, they are strictly beyond the range of applicability of the BCs. Nevertheless, the results using Patterson&#039;s temperature jump BC compare quite well with the DSMC and are consistently better than those using the standard Smoluchowski temperature jump BC. One explanation for this better performance is that an assumption made by Patterson, based on the flow being only slightly non-equilibrium, introduces an additional constraint to the resulting BC model in the case of highly non-equilibrium flows. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The study on fluid flow and transport processes of rock fractures in most practical applications involves two fundamental issues: the validity of Reynolds equation for fluid flow (as most often assumed) and the effects of shear displacements on the magnitudes and anisotropy of the fluid flow velocity field. The reason for such concerns is that the impact of the surface roughness of rock fractures is still an unresolved challenging issue. The later has been systematically investigated with results showing that shear displacement plays a dominant role on evolutions of fluid velocity fields, for both magnitudes and anisotropy, but the former has not received examinations in details due to the numerical complexities involving solution of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and the representations of fracture geometry during shear. The objective of this paper aims to solve this problem through a FEM modeling effort. Applying the COMSOL Multiphysics code (FEM) and assuming a 2D problem, we consider the coupled hydromechanical effect of fracture geometry change due to shear on fluid flow (velocity patterns) and particle transport (streamline/velocity dispersion), using measured topographical data of natural rock fracture surfaces. The fluid flow in the vertical 2D cross-sections of single rock fractures was simulated by solving both the Navier-Stokes and the Reynolds equation, and the particle transport was predicted by the streamline particle tracking method with calculated flow velocity fields (vectors) from the flow simulations, obtaining results such as flow velocity profiles, total flow rates, particle travel time, breakthrough curves and the Péclet number, Pe, respectively. The results obtained using NS and Reynolds equations were compared to illustrate the degree of the validity of the Reynolds equation for general applications in practice since the later is mush more computationally efficient for solving large-scale problems. The flow simulation results show that both the total flow rate and the flow velocity fields in a rough rock fracture predicted by the NS equation were quite different from those predicted by the Reynolds equation. The results show that a roughly 5-10% overestimation on the flow rate is produced when the Reynolds equation is used, and the ideal parabolic velocity profiles defined by the local cubic law, when Reynolds equation is used, is no longer valid, especially when the roughness feature of the fracture surfaces changes with shear. These deviations of flow rate and flow velocity profiles across the fracture aperture have a significant impact on the particle transport behavior and the associated properties, such as the travel time and Péclet number. The deviations increase with increasing flow velocity and become more significant when fracture aperture geometry changes with shear. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This method was first presented in 2009 at the ICOSAHOM congress with some Cartesian grid applications. We focus here on unstructured grid applications for which the EDG method seems very attractive. As in the Recovery method presented by van Leer and Nomura in 2005 for diffusion, jumps across element boundaries are locally eliminated by recovering the solution on an overlapping cell. In the case of Recovery, this cell is the union of the two neighboring cells and the Galerkin basis is twice as large as the basis used for one element.

As this analysis reveals that only few of the existing models are consistent with the symmetries, a new class of compatible models is proposed.

LSFEM are attractive because the resulting discrete equations yield symmetric, positive definite systems of algebraic equations and the functional provides both a local and global error measure. On the other hand, it has been documented for existing reformulations that certain types of boundary conditions and high-aspect ratio domains can yield very poor mass conservation. It has also been documented that improved mass conservation with LSFEM can be achieved by strengthening the coupling between the pressure and velocity. The new reformulation presented here is demonstrated to provide both improved multigrid convergence rates because it is differentially diagonally dominant and improved mass conservation over existing methods because it increases the pressure-velocity coupling along the inflow and outflow boundaries. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The MFS is a meshless method since it is free from the mesh generation and numerical integration. We will transform the Navier-Stokes equations into simple advection-diffusion and Poisson differential operators via the operator-splitting scheme or the so-called projection method, instead of directly using the more complicated fundamental solutions (Stokeslets) of the unsteady Stokes equations. The resultant velocity advection-diffusion equations and the pressure Poisson equation are then calculated by using the MFS together with the Eulerian-Lagrangian method (ELM) and the method of particular solutions (MPS). The proposed meshless numerical scheme is a first attempt to apply the MFS for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the moderate-Reynolds-number flow regimes. The lid-driven cavity flows at the Reynolds numbers up to 3200 for two-dimensional (2D) and 1000 for three-dimensional (3D) are chosen to validate the present algorithm. Through further simulating the flows in the 2D circular cavity with an eccentric rotating cylinder and in the 3D cube with a fixed sphere inside, we are able to demonstrate the advantages and flexibility of the proposed meshless method in the irregular geometry and multi-dimensional flows, even though very coarse node points are used in this study as compared with other mesh-dependent numerical schemes. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem is reduced to a nonlinear system of three partial differential equations for three unknown functions of the cylindrical coordinates r and z and time t. The three functions are sought in the form of power series in r with coefficients depending on t and z. For the unknown coefficients recurrence relations are obtained which contain three arbitrary functions. The relations are examined in three particular cases in which they give analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for any values of the coordinates t, z, and r.",

This technique is called pressure separation. It relies upon subtracting the gradient of an appropriate approximation of the pressure on both sides of the Navier-Stokes equations. With this, the finite element error estimate can be improved in the case of higher Reynolds numbers. For practical reasons, the pressure separation can be applied above all for finite element discretisations of the Navier-Stokes equations with piecewise constant pressure. This paper presents a computational study of five ways to compute an appropriate approximation of the pressure. These ways are assessed on two- and three-dimensional examples.

The stabilisation technique is combined with several different implicit time integration procedures including both finite difference and finite element schemes. Particular attention is given to the generalised-α method and the linear discontinuous in time finite element scheme. The time integration schemes are first applied to two model problems, represented by a first order differential equation in time and the one dimensional advection-diffusion equation, and subjected to a detailed mathematical analysis based on the Fourier series expansion. In order to establish the accuracy and efficiency of the time integration schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations, a detailed computational study is performed of two standard numerical examples: Unsteady flow around a cylinder and flow across a backward facing step. It is concluded that the semi-discrete generalised-a method provides a viable alternative to the more sophisticated and expensive space-time methods for simulations of unsteady flows of incompressible fluids governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The distinguishing feature of this new immersed boundary method is that the coefficients of the irregular finite-difference stencils in the vicinity of the immersed boundary are optimized to obtain improved numerical stability. This basic idea was introduced in a previous publication by the authors for the advection step in the projection method used to solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. This paper extends the original approach to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations considering flux vector splitting schemes and viscous wall boundary conditions at the immersed geometry. In addition to the stencil optimization procedure for the convective terms, this paper discusses other key aspects of the method, such as imposing flux boundary conditions at the immersed boundary and the discretization of the viscous flux in the vicinity of the boundary. Extensive linear stability investigations of the immersed scheme confirm that a linearly stable method is obtained. The method of manufactured solutions is used to validate the expected higher-order accuracy and to study the error convergence properties of this new method. Steady and unsteady, 2D and 3D canonical test cases are used for validation of the immersed boundary approach. Finally, the method is employed to simulate the laminar to turbulent transition process of a hypersonic Mach 6 boundary layer flow over a porous wall and subsonic boundary layer flow over a three-dimensional spherical roughness element.",

The free surface boundary conditions are accordingly modified to obtain the equations in the velocity and vorticity form without involving the pressure term. The kinematics of the fluid domain for the free surface flow is described using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method. The proposed model is first validated with numerical and analytical solutions available from the literature for the following cases: (1) an oblique rigid-lid driven cavity flow and (2) an incident solitary wave. Then the versatility of the algorithm is demonstrated by obtaining numerical results for (3) periodic waves generated in a channel by a piston wavemaker, and (4) solitary waves generated by critical flow over a submerged solid structure. The salient characteristics of the propagation of solitary waves are well-illustrated in the present study.",

A finite element pair, P1DGP2, which has good balance preserving properties is used here, consisting of a mix of discontinuous (for velocity components) and continuous (for pressure) basis functions.

The results of numerical tests are presented for a wind driven 2D gyre and the flow past a cylinder, which are simulated using the unstructured mesh finite element CFD model in order to illustrate the numerical performance of the method.

The standard way to enforce this type of boundary condition is described, followed by an adaptation of the one we proposed in [36] that provides higher pressure and velocity convergence rates in space and time for pressure-correction schemes. These two methods are illustrated with a numerical test with both finite volume and spectral Legendre methods. We conclude with three physical simulations: first with the flow over a backward-facing step, secondly, we study, in a geometry where a bifurcation takes place, the influence of Reynolds number on the laminar flow structure, and lastly, we verify the solution obtained for the unsteady flow around a square cylinder. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

In addition, we prove a finite time blow-up in the case where $\alpha&lt;1/3$. It is remarkable that the model with $\alpha=1/3$ enjoys the same estimates on the nonlinear term as the 4D Navier-Stokes equations.

          "abstract": "The form of the viscous term is discussed for incompressible flow on a two-dimensional curved surface S and for the shallow water equations. In the case of flow on a surface three versions are considered. These correspond to taking curl twice, to applying the Laplacian defined in terms of a metric, and to taking the divergence of a symmetric stress tensor. These differ on a curved surface, for example a sphere. The three terms are related and their properties discussed, in particular energy and angular momentum conservation. In the case of the shallow water equations again three forms of dissipation are considered, the last of which involves the divergence of a stress tensor. Their properties are discussed, including energy conservation and whether the rotating bucket solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation is reproduced. A derivation of the viscous term is also given based on shallow water equations as a truncation of the Navier-Stokes equation, with forces on a column determined by integration over the vertical. For both incompressible flow on a surface and for the shallow water equations, it is argued that a viscous term based on a symmetric stress tensor should be used as this leads to correct treatment of angular momentum.",

Naturally this feature has disqualified the theory for relativistic thermodynamics which must insist on finite speeds and, moreover, on speeds smaller than c. The attempts at a remedy have proved heuristically important for a new systematic type of thermodynamics: Extended thermodynamics. That new theory has symmetric hyperbolic field equations and thus it provides finite pulse speeds. Extended thermodynamics is a whole hierarchy of theories with an increasing number of fields when gradients and rates of thermodynamic processes become steeper and faster. The first stage in this hierarchy is the 14-field theory which may already be a useful tool for the relativist in many applications. The 14 fields - and further fields - are conveniently chosen from the moments of the kinetic theory of gases. The hierarchy is complete only when the number of fields tends to infinity. In that case the pulse speed of non-relativistic extended thermodynamics tends to infinity while the pulse speed of relativistic extended thermodynamics tends to c, the speed of light. In extended thermodynamics symmetric hyperbolicity - and finite speeds - are implied by the concavity of the entropy density. This is still true in relativistic thermodynamics for a privileged entropy density which is the entropy density of the rest frame for non-degenerate gases.",

The problem is formulated in cylindrical coordinates and the method is based on a Galerkin approximation scheme that makes use of vector expansions that exactly satisfy the continuity constraint. More specifically, the divergence-free basis vector functions are constructed with Fourier expansions in the ?? and z directions while mapped B-splines are used in the semi-infinite radial direction. Special care has been taken to account for the particular analytical behaviors at both end points r = 0 and r ??? ???. A modal reduction algorithm has also been implemented in the azimuthal direction, allowing for a relaxation of the CFL constraint on the timestep size and a possibly significant reduction of the number of DOF. The time marching is carried out using a mixed quasi-third order scheme. Besides the advantages of a divergence-free formulation and a quasi-spectral convergence, the local character of the B-splines allows for a great flexibility in node positioning while keeping narrow bandwidth matrices. Numerical tests show that the present method compares advantageously with other similar methodologies using purely global expansions. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

The numerical model is obtained by averaging the 3-D Navier-Stokes equations in the blade passage, keeping only the axisymmetric part of the equations. The averaging reduces the spatial dimension of the problem but introduces additional terms, the blade forces, which have to be modeled. In the present viscous through°ow model, the 2-D annulus endwall °ow is captured by the resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled to a simple mixing-length turbulence model. This allows to simulate high energy interactions and high losses near the endwalls. However, 3-D features such as tip or corner °ows cannot be predicted in axisymmetric computations. In the present contribution, these 3-D e®ects are modeled using empirical correlations from the literature. They are introduced into the equations, together with the pro¯le losses, by the so-called distributed loss model. Two test-cases, a high subsonic single stage compressor and a low speed three stage compressor, show the potential of the method.",

The feedback law is determined by solving a Linear-Quadratic control problem. We do not assume that the normal component of the control is equal to zero. In that case the state equation, satisfied by the velocity field y, is decoupled into an evolution equation satisfied by Py, where P is the so-called Helmholtz projection operator, and a quasi-stationary elliptic equation satisfied by (I − P)y. Using this decomposition we show that the feedback law can be expressed only in function of Py.

Xu, A well-balanced gas-kinetic scheme for the shallow-water equations with source terms, J. Comput. Phys. 178 (2002) 533-562) to multidimensional gas dynamic equations under gravitational fields. Four important issues in the construction of a well-balanced scheme for gas dynamic equations are addressed. First, the inclusion of the gravitational source term into the flux function is necessary. Second, to achieve second-order accuracy of a well-balanced scheme, the Chapman-Enskog expansion of the Boltzmann equation with the inclusion of the external force term is used. Third, to avoid artificial heating in an isolated system under a gravitational field, the source term treatment inside each cell has to be evaluated consistently with the flux evaluation at the cell interface. Fourth, the multidimensional approach with the inclusion of tangential gradients in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases becomes important in order to maintain the accuracy of the scheme. Many numerical examples are used to validate the above issues, which include the comparison between the solutions from the current scheme and the Strang splitting method. The methodology developed in this paper can also be applied to other systems, such as semi-conductor device simulations under electric fields. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The method achieves realistic interactive-rate fluid simulation by solving the physical governing laws of fluids but avoiding the extensive 3D fluid dynamics computation. Unlike previous computer graphics fluid models, our approach can simulate many different fluid behaviors by changing the internal or external boundary conditions. It can model different kinds of fluids by varying the Reynolds number. It can also simulate objects moving or floating in fluids. In addition, we can visualize the animation of the fluid flow field, the streakline of a flow field, and the blending of fluids of different colors. Our model can serve as a testbed to simulate many other fluid phenomena which have never been successfully modeled previously in computer graphics.",

Bifurcation diagrams are constructed by varying the Reynolds number, and a transition to hyperchaos (HC) is identified. Before the onset of HC, there is coexistence of two chaotic attractors and a hyperchaotic saddle. After the transition to HC, the two chaotic attractors merge with the hyperchaotic saddle, generating random switching between chaos and hyperchaos, which is responsible for intermittent bursts in the time series of energy and enstrophy. The chaotic mixing properties of the flow are characterized by detecting Lagrangian coherent structures. After the transition to HC, the flow displays complex Lagrangian patterns and an increase in the level of Lagrangian chaoticity during the bursty periods that can be predicted statistically by the hyperchaotic saddle prior to HC transition.",

A seventh order system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which approximates the behavior of the Navier-Stokes equations is obtained by using the Fourier Galerkin method. Extensive simulations show that the obtained system is able to display the different behaviors of the Navier-Stokes equations. Then the paper proposes two Lyapunov based controllers to either control the system of ordinary differential equations to a desired fixed point or to synchronize two ordinary differential equations systems obtained from the two dimensional Navier-Stokes equations under different initial conditions. The proposed control schemes are simulated using the MATLAB software and the simulation results show their effectiveness.",

The implementation is user-friendly, requiring the user to specify only three quantities for each desired vortex generator: the range of grid points over which the force is to be applied and the planform area and angle of incidence of the physical vane. The model behavior was evaluated for subsonic flowin a rectangular duct with a single vane vortex generator, subsonic flow in an S-duct with 22 corotating vortex generators, and supersonic flow in a rectangular duct with a counter-rotating vortex-generator pair. The model was also used to successfully simulate microramps in supersonic flow by treating each microramp as a pair of vanes with opposite angles of incidence. The validation results indicate that the source-term vortex-generator model provides a useful tool for screening vortex-generator configurations and gives comparable results to solutions computed using gridded vanes.",

Design/methodology/approach - A numerical algorithm based on high-order compact finite-difference schemes is developed for solving Navier-Stokes equations in two-dimensional space. The convective flux terms are discretized by using advection upstream splitting method (AUSM). The developed method is then used to compute some example laminar flow problems. The problems considered have a range of Mach number that corresponds to subsonic incompressible flow to hypersonic compressible flows that contain shock waves and shock/boundary-layer interaction. Findings - The paper shows that the AUSM flux splitting and high-order compact finite-difference methods can be used accurately and robustly in resolving shear layers and capturing shock waves. The highly diffusive nature of conventional flux splitting especially on coarse grids makes them inaccurate for boundary layers even with high-order discretization. Originality/value - This paper presents a high-order numerical method that can accurately and robustly capture shock waves without deteriorating oscillations and resolve boundary layers and shock/boundary layer interaction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

The algorithms operate on a nodal basis, where the finite element information is stored as the co-ordinates of the nodes and the nodes in each element. Temporary storage is needed, such as the search vectors correction vectors and right hand side vectors in the conjugate gradient algorithms which are limited to one-dimensional vectors. The nodal solution algorithms consist of splitting the Navier-Stokes equations into equation systems which are solved sequencially. In the pressure split algorithm, the velocities are found from the diffusion-convection equation and the pressure is computed from these velocities. The computed velocities are then corrected with the pressure gradient. In the velocity-pressure split algorithm, a velocity approximation is first found from the diffusion equation. This velocity is corrected by solving the convection equation. The pressure is then found from these velocities. Finally, the velocities are corrected by the pressure gradient. The nodal algorithms are compared by solving the original Navier-Stokes equations. The pressure split and velocity-pressure split equation systems are solved using ILU preconditioned conjugate gradient methods where the equation matrices are stored, and by using diagonal preconditioned conjugate gradient methods without storing the equation matrices. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

          "abstract": "In an effort to exploit the favorable stability properties of implicit methods and thereby increase computational efficiency by taking large time steps, an implicit finite-difference method for the multidimensional Navier-Stokes. equations is presented. The method consists of a generalized implicit scheme which has been linearized by Taylor expansion about the solution at the known time level to produce a set of coupled linear difference equations which are valid for a given time step. To solve these difference equations, the Douglas-Gunn procedure for generating alternating-direction implicit (ADI) schemes as perturbations of fundamental implicit difference schemes is employed. The resulting sequence of narrow block-banded systems can be solved efficiently by standard block-elimination methods. The method is a one-step method, as opposed to a predictor-corrector method, and requires no iteration to compute the solution for a single time step. Test calculations are presented for a three-dimensional application to subsonic flow in a straight duct with rectangular cross section. Stability is demonstrated for time steps which are orders of magnitude larger than the maximum allowable time step for conditionally stable methods as determined by the well-known CFL condition. The computational effort per time step is discussed and is very approximately only twice that of most explicit methods. The accuracy of computed solutions is examined by mesh refinement and comparison with other analytical and experimental results. ?? 1977.",

The two problems satisfy the full homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the velocity. On the other hand, a locally stabilized term is added in the second step of the schemes.

A Chapman-Enskog expansion of the PDE system predicts that the macroscopic behavior corresponds to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with additional &#039;compressibility error&#039; of order Mach number squared. We numerically demonstrate convergence of the BGK schemes to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and quantify the errors associated with compressibility and discretization effects. When compressibility error is smaller than discretization error, convergence in both grid spacing and time step is shown to be second-order for the LB method and is confirmed to be fourth-order for the fourth-order BGK solver. However, when the compressibility error is simultaneously reduced as the grid is refined, the LB method behaves as a first-order scheme in time.",

The scope of the application of MLS is threefold: (1) computation of high-order derivatives of the field variables for a Godunov-type approach to hyperbolic problems or terms of hyperbolic character, (2) direct reconstruction of the fluxes at cell edges, for elliptic problems or terms of elliptic character, and (3) multiresolution shock detection and selective limiting. A major advantage of the proposed methodology over the most popular existing higher-order methods is related to the viscous discretization. The use of MLS approximations allows the direct reconstruction of high-order viscous fluxes using quite compact stencils, and without introducing new degrees of freedom, which results in a significant reduction in storage and workload. A selective limiting procedure is proposed, based on the multiresolution properties of the MLS approximants, which allows to switch off the limiters in smooth regions of the flow. Accuracy tests show that the proposed method achieves the expected convergence rates. Representative simulations show that the methodology is applicable to problems of engineering interest. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Accurate prediction of transition onset is fundamental to the modelling of these flows. In most flow solvers based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, transition onset must be specified manually. To overcome this weakness and to more accurately predict aerodynamic flow fields, a boundary layer transition prediction methodology is presented. This methodology, which has been applied to a Navier–Stokes solver, dynamically locates transition onset as the flow solution is converging. The prediction methodology identifies several boundary layer transition mechanisms, including Tollmien–Schlichting instability, laminar separation and turbulence contamination. Where possible, the implementation utilizes the calculated boundary layer velocity profiles to strongly couple the predicted transition locations and the flow solution. The transition prediction methodology was used to predicted transition onset for the NLF(1)-0416 and S809 single-element wind turbine airfoils. Results obtained with numerical calculations are found to agree well with experimental observations. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

Its main advantage is the reduction in the\ncomputational cost, for a given accuracy, with respect standard finite\nvolume methods due to the inexpensive high-order discretization that\nmay be obtained in the third direction using fast Fourier transforms.\nThe method has been applied to the resolution of transitional bubbles\nin flat plates with adverse pressure gradients and realistic two-dimensional\nairfoils.",

One of the most important advantages of the proposed scheme is its capability to use large time step sizes for the solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. DLSM method uses moving least-squares shape functions for function approximation and discrete least-squares technique for discretization of the governing differential equations and their boundary conditions. As there is no need for a background mesh, the DLSM method can be called a truly meshless method and enjoys symmetric and positive-definite properties. Several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the ability and the efficiency of the proposed scheme and the discrete least-squares meshless method.

The IB method uses a set of discrete delta functions to spread the entire singular force exerted by the immersed boundary to the nearby fluid grid points. Our method instead incorporates part of this force into jump conditions for the pressure, avoiding discrete dipole terms that adversely affect the accuracy near the immersed boundary. This has been implemented for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a high-resolution finite-volume method for the advective terms and a projection method to enforce incompressibility. In the projection step, the correct jump in pressure is imposed in the course of solving the Poisson problem. This gives sharp resolution of the pressure across the interface and also gives better volume conservation than the traditional IB method. Comparisons between this method and the IB method are presented for several test problems. Numerical studies of the convergence and order of accuracy are included.",

For large values of the regularizing parameter, compared to the Kolmogorov length scale, simulations exhibit multiscaling inertial range, and the dissipation range displaying low intermittency.

Our approach could be essentially divided in three fundamental com- ponents: finite difference for spatial approximation, second order accurate method for temporal discretization and level set methods for boundary rep- resentation. The domain is discretized by a regular Cartesian grid. The boundary is described by level set methods. In this context the boundary is seen as a zero level set of a specific function. Navier-Stokes equations is solved starting from Semi-Lagrangian methods, achieving second order accuracy in time and space.

Anisotropy appears as an important qualitative feature in the analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations: it is also shown that initial data which does not belong to $\cG$ (hence which produces a solution blowing up in finite time) cannot have a strong anisotropy in its frequency support.",

For incompressible flows, the boundary conditions lead to a well-posed problem, convey properly the vortices without any reflections on the artificial limits and allow to compute turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers. For compressible flows, the boundary conditions convey properly the vortices without any reflections on the artificial limits and also avoid acoustic waves that go back into the flow and change its behaviour. Numerical tests illustrate the efficiency of the various boundary conditions.",

One key difference from other works is that we use a sharp, unregularized mask function. We discuss how to construct the active penalty term, and provide numerical examples, in dimensions one and two. We demonstrate second and third order convergence for the heat equation, and second order convergence for the Navier-Stokes equations. In addition, we show that modifying the penalty term does not significantly alter the time step restriction from that of the conventional penalty method.",

          "abstract": "The paper presents the first implementation of a primitive variable spectral method for calculating viscous flows inside a sphere. A variational formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations is adopted using a fractional-step time discretization with the classical second-order backward difference scheme combined with explicit extrapolation of the nonlinear term. The resulting scalar and vector elliptic equations are solved by means of the direct spectral solvers developed recently by the authors. The spectral matrices for radial operators are characterized by a minimal sparsity - diagonal stiffness and tridiagonal mass matrix. Closed-form expressions of their nonzero elements are provided here for the first time, showing that the condition number of the relevant matrices grows as the second power of the truncation order. A new spectral elliptic solver for the velocity unknown in spherical coordinates is also described that includes implicitly the Coriolis force in a rotating frame, but requires a minimal coupling between the modal velocity components in the Fourier space. The numerical tests confirm that the proposed method achieves spectral accuracy and ensures infinite differentiability to all orders of the numerical solution, by construction. These results indicate that the new primitive variable spectral solver is an effective alternative to the spectral method recently proposed by Kida and Nakayama, where the velocity field is represented in terms of poloidal and toroidal functions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We have derived for the first time the interface conditions for the intermediate velocity field and the pressure potential function that are introduced in the projection method. Differentiation of the velocity components on stencils across the interface is aided by the coupled fictitious velocity values, whose representations are solved by using the coupled velocity interface conditions. These fictitious values and the non-staggered grid allow a convenient and accurate approximation of the pressure and potential jump conditions. A compact finite difference method was adopted to explicitly compute the pressure derivatives at regular nodes to avoid the pressure-velocity decoupling. Numerical experiments verified the desired accuracy of the numerical method. Applications to geophysical problems demonstrated that the sharp pressure jumps on the clast-Newtonian matrix are accurately captured for various shear conditions, moderate viscosity contrasts and a wide range of density contrasts. We showed that large transfer errors will be introduced to the jumps of the pressure and the potential function in case of a large absolute difference of the viscosity across the interface; these errors will cause simulations to become unstable. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

The method is devised by using the discontinuous Galerkin approximation with a special choice of the numerical fluxes and weakly imposing the continuity of the normal component of the numerical fluxes across the element interfaces. This allows the approximate conserved variables defining the discontinuous Galerkin solution to be locally condensed, thereby resulting in a reduced system which involves only the degrees of freedom of the approximate traces of the solution. The HDG method inherits the geometric flexibility and arbitrary high order accuracy of Discontinuous Galerkin methods, and offers a significant reduction in the computational cost as well as improved accuracy and convergence properties. In particular, we show that HDG produces optimal converges rates for both the conserved quantities as well as the viscous stresses and the heat fluxes.

The method consists in introducing the projection of the pressure gradient and adding the difference between the pressure Laplacian and the divergence of this new field to the incompressibility equation, both multiplied by suitable algorithmic parameters. The main purpose of this paper is to discuss how to deal with the new variable in the implementation of the algorithm. Obviously, it could be treated as one extra unknown, either explicity or as a condensed variable. However, we take for granted that the only way for the algorithm to be efficient is to uncouple it from the velocity-pressure calculation in one way or another. Here we discuss some iterative schemes to perform this uncoupling of the pressure gradient projection (PGP) from the calculation of the velocity and the pressure, both for the stationary and the transient Navier-Stokes equations. In the first case, the strategies analyzed refer to the interaction of the linearization loop and the iterative segregation of the PGP, whereas in the second the main dilemma concerns the explicit or implicit treatment of the PGP.

          "abstract": "Over the past one hundred years, Brownian motion theory has contributed substantially to our understanding of various microscopic phenomena. Originally proposed as a phenomenological paradigm for atomistic matter interactions, the theory has since evolved into a broad and vivid research area, with an ever increasing number of applications in biology, chemistry, finance, and physics. The mathematical description of stochastic processes has led to new approaches in other fields, culminating in the path integral formulation of modern quantum theory. Stimulated by experimental progress in high energy physics and astrophysics, the unification of relativistic and stochastic concepts has re-attracted considerable interest during the past decade. Focusing on the framework of special relativity, we review, here, recent progress in the phenomenological description of relativistic diffusion processes. After a brief historical overview, we will summarize basic concepts from the Langevin theory of nonrelativistic Brownian motions and discuss relevant aspects of relativistic equilibrium thermostatistics. The introductory parts are followed by a detailed discussion of relativistic Langevin equations in phase space. We address the choice of time parameters, discretization rules, relativistic fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and Lorentz transformations of stochastic differential equations. The general theory is illustrated through analytical and numerical results for the diffusion of free relativistic Brownian particles. Subsequently, we discuss how Langevin-type equations can be obtained as approximations to microscopic models. The final part of the article is dedicated to relativistic diffusion processes in Minkowski spacetime. Since the velocities of relativistic particles are bounded by the speed of light, nontrivial relativistic Markov processes in spacetime do not exist; i.e., relativistic generalizations of the nonrelativistic diffusion equation and its Gaussian solutions must necessarily be non-Markovian. We compare different proposals that were made in the literature and discuss their respective benefits and drawbacks. The review concludes with a summary of open questions, which may serve as a starting point for future investigations and extensions of the theory. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

First, coarsening is not possible to full extent since the geometry must be resolved by the coarsest grid used. Second, for semi-implicit time-stepping schemes, robustness of the convergence rates is usually not obtained for convection-diffusion problems, especially for higher Reynolds numbers. We show that both problems can be overcome by the use of algebraic multigrid (AMG), which we apply for the solution of the pressure and momentum equations in explicit and semi-implicit time-stepping schemes. We consider the convergence rates of AMG for several model problems and demonstrate the robustiness of the proposed scheme. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

The fluid velocity and temperature correspond to the normal to the horizon and to the surface gravity, respectively. The second law of thermodynamics for the fluid is mapped into the area increase theorem of General Relativity. The analysis is applicable, in general, to perturbations around a stationary horizon, when the scale of variations of the macroscopic fields is much larger than the inverse of the temperature.

They are Kinetic Flux-Vector Splitting (KFVS), Kinetic Wave/Particle Splitting (KWPS), and Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) methods. For the Euler equations, the most sophisticated BGK scheme can be interpreted as a relaxation scheme between the two KFVS schemes with different moments, KFVS and KFVS_u 
                        0. It improves the accuracy over the KFVS scheme and the robustness over the KFVS_u 
                        0 scheme. The direct generalization of this relaxation approach to the Navier-Stokes equations leads to a much simpler BGK scheme than the one in the literature. In this simplified BGK scheme, there exist two types of particle collision time. The one in the BGK model acts as a relaxation parameter. Its role is to add some numerical dissipation from the KFVS scheme to the KFVS_u 
                        0 scheme. On the other hand, the one in the Chapman-Enskog expansion of the gas distribution function is related to physical dissipation. Following the same approach, another type of BGK schemes is further developed, which is a relaxation scheme between KWPS and KWPS_u 
                        0. In spite of the fact that the KWPS scheme is more diffusive than the KFVS scheme, a BGK scheme based on KWPS and KWPS_u 
                        0 is found not only computationally more efficient but also less diffusive than a BGK scheme based on KFVS and KFVS_u

Recently, a mass flux based interpolation (MFBI) interface algorithm was proposed for Chimera grids [Tang HS, Jones SC, Sotiropoulos F. An overset grid method for 3D unsteady incompressible flows. J Comput Phys, 2003;191:567-600] and it has been successfully applied to a variety of flows. MFBI determines velocity and pressure at grid interfaces by mass conservation and interpolation, and it is easy to implement. Compared with the commonly used standard interpolation, which directly interpolates velocity as well as pressure, the proposed interface algorithm gives fewer solution oscillations and faster convergence rates. This paper makes a study on MFBI. Starting with discussions about grid connectivity, it is shown that MFBI is second-order accurate for mass flux across grid interface. It is also derived that the scheme provides second-order accuracy for momentum flux. In addition, another version of MFBI is presented. At last, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate that MFBI honors mass flux balance at grid interfaces and it leads to second-order accurate solutions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The equation for kinetic energy is derived from the momentum equation; it is therefore a consequence of the discretized momentum balance rather than a separate equation. For this reason, the conservation of kinetic energy is commonly referred to as secondary conservation, in contrast to the primary conservation of mass and momentum. When solving the Navier–Stokes equations numerically, there are several reasons to discretely mimic the exact conservation properties of these three quantities. First, since the kinetic energy is a norm of the solution, a method that conserves this property is guaranteed to be stable. Secondly, it is well known that absence of artificial dissipation leads to vastly improved accuracy in large eddy simulations (LES).",

Our first main result, using the abstract framework established by the authors in the companion work citeGMWZ6, is to show that existence and stability of arbitrary amplitude exact boundary-layer solutions follow from a uniform spectral stability condition on layer profiles that is expressible in terms of an Evans function (uniform Evans stability). Whenever this condition holds we give a rigorous description of the small viscosity limit as the solution of a hyperbolic problem with &quot;residual&quot; boundary conditions. Our second is to show that uniform Evans stability for small-amplitude layers is equivalent to Evans stability of the limiting constant layer, which in turn can be checked by a linear-algebraic computation. Finally, for a class of symmetric-dissipative systems including the physical examples mentioned above, we carry out energy estimates showing that constant (and thus small-amplitude) layers always satisfy uniform Evans stability. This yields existence of small-amplitude multi-dimensional boundary layers for the compressible Navier-Stokes and MHD equations. For both equations these appear to be the first such results in the compressible case.",

The pressure equation is derived from the mass conservation without any approximation procedure, such as adopted in the previously developed SIMPLE algorithm based finite element method. Therefore, the present numerical algorithm gives more accurate results than it does. Furthermore, the newly proposed pressure equation successfully treats the outflow boundary condition. The present algorithm has been applied to the well-known bench mark problems and proves to be efficient and accurate.",

The numerical results obtained by the KRLNS equations using higher order difference approximations are in excellent agreement with those obtained by the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the pseudo-spectral method (PSM), which is a standard approach to incompressible viscous flows. It is confirmed that the KRLNS method can capture the correct transient behavior without use of sub-iterations due to a smoothing effect introduced by using the Grand potential in the continuity equation, and keep the fluctuation of velocity divergence at small level by taking sufficiently low Mach number. Parallel computations are carried out on a GPU based on NVIDIA Tesla C1060 system and the provided CUDA library. High values of speedup are obtained for three methods, the KRLNS equations, PSM and LBM.",

The computational cost, in terms of CPU time, grows with the size of the system (i.e., spatial resolution) according to a power law with exponent around 1.7, which is very modest compared to direct methods, indicating the appropriateness of the schemes for large nonlinear partial differential equation problems.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we present spectral/hp penalty least-squares finite element formulation for the numerical solution of steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The continuity equation is treated as a constraint on velocity field and the constraint is enforced using the penalty method, which is equivalent to replacing the pressure variable p with pn = pn - 1 - ??(??? ?? u), where u is the velocity field, ?? is the penalty parameter and superscript &#039;n&#039; is non-linear iteration number. The modified Navier-Stokes equations are expressed as an equivalent set of first-order equations by introducing vorticity-dilatation or stresses as additional independent variables and the least-squares method is used to develop the finite element model. High-order basis functions are used to construct the discrete model. Unlike other penalty finite element formulations, equal order integration is used for all terms of the coefficient matrix. Schur complement method is used and all interior element degrees of freedom are condensed out and interface degrees of freedom are solved either by direct solver (banded Cholesky factorization) or iterative solver (preconditioned conjugate gradient). Present formulation produces very accurate results for even very low penalty parameters (10-40). In this way present formulation (and implementation) fixes perennial problem of bad conditioning of coefficient matrix associated with penalty formulations. Proposed formulation is verified using the exact solution of Kovasznay flow. Numerical results are also presented for a number of two-dimensional benchmark problems, e.g., 2D lid-driven cavity flow, flow over a backward-facing step, steady flow past a circular cylinder, and 2D flow past a large circular cylinder in a channel. Finally, the proposed formulation is extended to coupled velocity-temperature problems, and buoyant flow inside a square enclosure is solved to test the penalty least-squares finite element model developed herein. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The formulas contain from two to five additional free parameters, which are not present in the initial solutions to the two-dimensional equations. It is important that these formulas do not contain quadratures in the steady-state case. We consider some examples of constructing new three-dimensional exact solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations using the derived formulas. The results are used to solve some problems of the hydrodynamics of a viscous incompressible liquid. Examples of thenonuniqueness of solutions to steady-state problems are given. Some three-dimensional solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations are constructed using nonviscous solutions to the Euler equations. Two classes of new exact solutions to the Grad–Shafranov equation that contain functional arbitrariness are specified. Note that, in this study, a new method for constructing exact solutions is applied that can be useful for analyzing other nonlinear physical models and phenomena. Several physical and physicochemical systems where this method can be used are considered.",

Asinari, Phys. Rev. E 77, 056706 (2008)]. The theoretical basis is the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type kinetic model for gas mixtures [P. Andries, K. Aoki, and B. Perthame, J. Stat. Phys. 106, 993 (2002)]. In the present paper, the recovered macroscopic equations in the continuum limit are systematically investigated by varying the ratio between the characteristic diffusion speed and the characteristic barycentric speed. It comes out that the diffusion speed must be at least one order of magnitude (in terms of Knudsen number) smaller than the barycentric speed, in order to recover the Navier-Stokes equations for mixtures in the incompressible limit. Some further numerical tests are also reported. In particular, (1) the solvent and dilute test cases are considered, because they are limiting cases in which the Maxwell-Stefan model reduces automatically to Fickian cases. Moreover, (2) some tests based on the Stefan diffusion tube are reported for proving the complete capabilities of the proposed scheme in solving Maxwell-Stefan diffusion problems. The proposed scheme agrees well with the expected theoretical results.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the efficiency and speed-up of parallel-in-time calculations of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a PC-cluster. The parallel-in-time method is based on the alternate use of coarse global sequential solvers with fine local parallel ones in an iterative predictor-corrector fashion. Therefore, the efficiency of parallel calculations is strongly dependent on the number of iterations required for convergence. The one-dimensional scalar transport equation and the two-dimensional incompressible unsteady form of the Navier-Stokes equations were used to conduct numerical experiments to derive some conclusions concerning the accuracy and convergence of the iterative method. A simple performance model is proposed to estimate the efficiency of the parallel calculations as a function of the most relevant parameters that contribute to the computing time required to perform a parallel-in-time calculation. Among them, we have analyzed the influence of the number of processors, the number of iterations in the parallel-in-time algorithm and the influence of the coarse to fine time-grid step size ratio. The good agreement between the obtained parallel efficiency and the values estimated by the proposed performance model allows to conclude that parallel-in-time efficiency is quantitatively different from the parallel efficiency of the space domain decomposition, regarding the number of processors available for a fixed problem dimension. A significant speed-up is possible when the temporal scale of the problem is large and enough processors are available.",

          "abstract": "Many problems involving fluid flow can now be simulated numerically, providing a useful predictive tool for a wide range of engineering applications. Of particular interest in this thesis are computational methods for solving the problem of compressible fluid flow around aerodynamic configurations. A finite element method is presented for solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions on unstructured meshes. The method is stablized by the addition of a least-squares operator (an inexpensive simplification of the Galerkin least-squares method), leading to solutions free of spurious oscillations. Convergence to steady state is reached via a backward Euler time-stepping scheme, and the use of local time-steps allows convergence to be accelerated. The choice of both the nonlinear solver, which is employed to solve the algebraic system arising at each time-step, and the iterative method used within this solver, is fully discussed, along with an inexpensive technique for approximating the Jacobian matrix. In order to obtain accurate solutions more effectively, the idea of adapting the mesh is investigated, and two distinct methods of mesh refinement are described in detail. These are the addition of nodes to the mesh in regions determined by an error indicator (h - refinement and the local repositioning of existing nodes using the value of this error indicator across neighbouring elements (r - refinement). As well as considering these adaptive techniques separately, we introduce an original algorithm which combines the two ideas, with results indicating that this combination is an effective approach. The example problems used consist mainly of steady transonic flow at low to moderate Reynolds numbers. Transient flow problems are also considered, and we examine the difficulties which occur when the method of lines is used as a solution technique and h-refinement (including derefinement of elements) is carried out.",

          "abstract": "The discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin methodology with optimal test functions (DPG) of Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan [18,20] guarantees the optimality of the solution in an energy norm, and provides several features facilitating adaptive schemes. Whereas Bubnov-Galerkin methods use identical trial and test spaces, Petrov-Galerkin methods allow these function spaces to differ. In DPG, test functions are computed on the fly and are chosen to realize the supremum in the inf-sup condition; the method is equivalent to a minimum residual method. For well-posed problems with sufficiently regular solutions, DPG can be shown to converge at optimal rates-the inf-sup constants governing the convergence are mesh-independent, and of the same order as those governing the continuous problem [48]. DPG also provides an accurate mechanism for measuring the error, and this can be used to drive adaptive mesh refinements. We employ DPG to solve the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions, building on previous work on the Stokes equations, and focusing particularly on the usefulness of the approach for automatic adaptivity starting from a coarse mesh. We apply our approach to a manufactured solution due to Kovasznay as well as the lid-driven cavity flow, backward-facing step, and flow past a cylinder problems.",

Instead of introducing a Lagrange&#039;s multiplier to enforce the vesicle inextensibility constraint, we modify the model by adopting a spring-like tension to make the vesicle boundary nearly inextensible so that solving for the unknown tension can be avoided. We also derive a new elastic force from the modified vesicle energy and obtain exactly the same form as the originally unmodified one. In order to represent the vesicle boundary, we use Fourier spectral approximation so we can compute the geometrical quantities on the interface more accurately. A series of numerical tests on the present scheme have been conducted to illustrate the applicability and reliability of the method. We first perform the accuracy check of the geometrical quantities of the interface, and the convergence check for different stiffness numbers as well as fluid variables. Then we study the vesicle dynamics in quiescent flow and in gravity. Finally, the shapes of vesicles in Poiseuille flow are investigated in detail to study the effects of the reduced volume, the confinement, and the mean flow velocity. The numerical results are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained in literature. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

In the model the two sets of equations are coupled through an extra phase induced stress term in the Navier--Stokes equations and a fluid induced transport term in the Cahn--Hilliard equation. Fully discrete mixed finite element methods are proposed for approximating the coupled system, it is shown that the proposed numerical methods satisfy a mass conservation law, and a discrete energy law which is analogous to the basic energy law for the phase field model. The convergence of the numerical solutions to the solutions of the phase field model and its sharp interface limit is established by utilizing the discrete energy law. As a by-product, the convergence result also provides a constructive proof of the existence of weak solutions to the Navier--Stokes-Cahn--Hilliard phase field model. Numerical experiments are also presented to validate the theory and to show the effectiveness of the combined phase field and finite element approach.",

The Navier-Stokes and continuity equations are expressed in general non-orthogonal coordinates and are solved sequentially. All linear algebraic equations in the algorithm are solved by the Thomas algorithm. The method derives its efficiency mainly from the combination of a marching scheme along the main flow direction and the multigrid technique. For parabolic and slightly elliptic flows with recirculation, the marching-type algorithm can be used to solve the reduced or complete Navier-Stokes equations and produce comparable predictions. Comparisons are made between solutions from the complete/reduced Navier-Stokes equations and the effect of the equations on the algorithm&#039;s convergence rate is discussed. For flows with large recirculation, the reduced Navier-Stokes equations still produce a comparable solution to that of the complete Navier-Stokes equations, and the former equations are not only economical to compute but can also offer faster convergence. Both linear/nonlinear versions of the multigrid technique are incorporated in the marching-type algorithm. The overall acceleration of the convergence rate by the multigrid technique is shown by the computational results presented in this paper. More than three total mesh levels are recommended if the linear multigrid technique is used. Both linear/nonlinear versions of the multigrid technique are found to have a similar acceleration effect. The sequence in which the Navier-Stokes equations are solved is found to have influence on the convergence behaviour and the final residual level.",

This association allows to reduce memory requirements and operation counts by avoiding the complete construction of the Jacobian matrix and solving a problem of reduced size. Numerical examples in two space dimensions indicate that the performance of the present method is seen to be significantly improved in terms of CPU time. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Under appropriate assumptions on the initial data, the solution of the compressible equations consists-to first order-of a solution of the incompressible equations plus a function which is highly oscillatory in time. We show that the highly oscillatory part (the sound waves) can be described by wave equations, at least locally in time. We also show that the bounded derivative principle is valid; i.e., the highly oscillatory part can be suppressed by initialization. Besides the Cauchy problem, we also consider an initial-boundary value problem. At the inflow boundary, the viscous term in the Navier-Stokes equations is important. We consider the case where the compressible pressure is prescribed at inflow. In general, one obtains a boundary layer in the pressure; in the velocities a boundary layer is not present to first approximation. ?? 1991.",

          "abstract": "In this paper an adaptive parallel multigrid method and an application example for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are described. The strategy of the adaptivity in the sense of local grid refinement in the multigrid context is the multilevel adaptive technique (MLAT) suggested by Brandt. The parallelization of this method on scalable parallel systems is based on the portable communication library CLIC and the message-passing standards: PARMACS, PVM and MPI. The specific problem considered in this work is a two-dimensional hole pressure problem in which a Poiseuille channel flow is disturbed by a cavity on one side of the channel. Near geometric singularities a very fine grid is needed for obtaining an accurate solution of the pressure value. Two important issues of the efficiency of adaptive parallel multigrid algorithms, namely the data redistribution strategy and the refinement criterion, are discussed here. For approximate dynamic load balancing, new data in the adaptive steps are redistributed into distributed memories in different processors of the parallel system by block remapping. Among several refinement criteria tested in this work, the most suitable one for the specific problem is that based on finite-element residuals from the point of view of self-adaptivity and computational efficiency, since it is a kind of error indicator and can stop refinement algorithms in a natural way for a given tolerance. Comparisons between different global grids without and with local refinement have shown the advantages of the self-adaptive technique, as this can save computer memory and speed up the computing time several times without impairing the numerical accuracy. © 1997 By John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The accurate treatment of finite-rate chemistry is possible by the application of stochastic turbulence models which generalize Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Usually, one considers linear stochastic equations. In this way, fluctuations are generated by uncorrelated forces and relax with a frequency that is independent of the actual fluctuation. It has been proved that such linear equations are well appropriate to simulate near-equilibrium flows. However, the inapplicability or unfeasibility of other methods also results in a need for stochastic methods for more complex flow simulations. Their construction requires an extension of the simple mechanism of linear stochastic equations. Two ways to perform this are investigated here. The first way is the construction of a stochastic model for velocities where the relaxation frequency depends on the actual fluctuation. This is a requirement to involve relevant mixing variations due to large-scale flow structures. The stochastic model developed is applied to the simulation of convective boundary layer turbulence. Comparisons with the results of measurements provide evidence for its good performance and the advantages compared to existing methods. The second way presented here is the construction of scalar equations which involve memory effects regarding to both the stochastic forcing and relaxation of fluctuations. This allows to overcome shortcomings of existing stochastic methods. The model predictions are shown to be in excellent agreement with the results of the direct numerical simulation of scalar mixing in stationary, homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The consideration of memory effects is found to be essential to simulate correctly the evolution of scalar fields within the first stage of mixing.",

Taking our motivation from the work of Ashurst, Kerstein, Kerr and Gibbon, who observed that the vorticity vector ω aligns with the intermediate eigenvector of the strain-matrix S, we study this problem in the context of both the three-dimensional Euler and Navier–Stokes equations using the variables α = ˆ ξ · S ˆ ξ and χ = ˆ ξ ×S ˆ ξ where ˆ ξ = ω/ω. This introduces the dynamic angle φ(x,t) = arctan( χ α ), which lies between ω and Sω. For the Euler equations a closed set of differential equations for α and χ is derived in terms of the Hessian matrix of the pressure P ={p,ij }. For the Navier–Stokes equations, the Burgers vortex and shear-layer solutions turn out to be the Lagrangian fixed-point solutions of the equivalent (α,χ) equations with a corresponding angle φ = 0. Under certain assumptions for more general flows it is shown that there is an attracting fixed point of the (α,χ) equations which corresponds to positive vortex stretching and for which the cosine of the corresponding angle is close to unity. This indicates that near alignment is an attracting state of the system and is consistent with the formation of Burgers-like structures.",

          "abstract": "The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been widely used for the simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. The finite difference Boltzmann method (FDBM) in which the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation is solved instead of the lattice Boltzmann equation has also been applied as an alternative method for simulating the incompressible flows. The particle velocities of the FDBM can be selected independently from the lattice configuration. In this paper, taking account of this advantage, we present the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation that has a minimum set of the particle velocities with the lattice Bharnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model for the three-dimensional incompressible NS equations. To recover incompressible NS equations, tensors of the particle velocities have to be isotropic up to the fifth rank. Thus, we propose to apply the icosahedral vectors that have 13 degrees of freedom to the particle velocity distributions. Validity of the proposed model (D3Q13BGK) is confirmed by numerical simulations of the shear-wave decay problem and the Taylor-Green vortex problem. With respect to numerical accuracy, computational efficiency and numerical stability, we compare the proposed model with the conventional lattice BGK models (D3Q15, D3Q19 and D3Q27) and the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) model (D3Q13MRT) that has the same degrees of freedom as our proposal. The comparisons show that the compressibility error of the proposed model is approximately double that of the conventional lattice BGK models, but the computational efficiency of the proposed model is superior to that of the others. The linear stability of the proposed model is also superior to that of the lattice BGK models. However, in non-linear simulations, the proposed model tends to be less stable than the others. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "We discuss the dynamics of zonal (or unidirectional) jets for barotropic flows forced by Gaussian stochastic fields with white in time correlation functions. This problem contains the stochastic dynamics of 2D Navier-Stokes equation as a special case. We consider the limit of weak forces and dissipation, when there is a time scale separation between the inertial time scale (fast) and the spin-up or spin-down time (large) needed to reach an average energy balance. In this limit, we show that an adiabatic reduction (or stochastic averaging) of the dynamics can be performed. We then obtain a kinetic equation that describes the slow evolution of zonal jets over a very long time scale, where the effect of non-zonal turbulence has been integrated out. The main theoretical difficulty, achieved in this work, is to analyze the stationary distribution of a Lyapunov equation that describes quasi-Gaussian fluctuations around each zonal jet, in the inertial limit. This is necessary to prove that there is no ultraviolet divergence at leading order in such a way that the asymptotic expansion is self-consistent. We obtain at leading order a Fokker--Planck equation, associated to a stochastic kinetic equation, that describes the slow jet dynamics. Its deterministic part is related to well known phenomenological theories (for instance Stochastic Structural Stability Theory) and to quasi-linear approximations, whereas the stochastic part allows to go beyond the computation of the most probable zonal jet. We argue that the effect of the stochastic part may be of huge importance when, as for instance in the proximity of phase transitions, more than one attractor of the dynamics is present.",

The projection method is used to separate advection and diffusion terms from the pressure terms in Navier-Stokes equations. MacCormack’s explicit scheme is used for the advection and diffusion terms, and it has second-order accuracy in both space and time. The pressure variable is further separated into hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures so that the computer rounding errors can be largely avoided. The resulting hydrodynamic pressure equation is solved by a multigrid method. A staggered mesh and central spatial finite-difference scheme are used. The model is tested against the experimental data of Luth et al., and the comparison shows that higher harmonics can be modeled well. Comparison of the model solutions with the elliptic shoal case confirms that the present model works well for wave refraction and diffraction with strong wave focusing.",

Special care is taken to ensure that the resulting eigensystem is independent of the density ratio and the local volume fraction, which renders the scheme well-suited to high density ratio, phase-separated two-fluid flows characteristic of many cavitating and boiling systems. To demonstrate the capabilities of the scheme, several two- and three-dimensional examples are presented.",

The fluid velocity and pressure fields are approximated by a linear superposition of particular solutions of a Stokes non-homogeneous system of equations with multiquadric (MQ) radial basis function as the source term. The nonlinear convective terms of the momentum equations are linearly approximated by using a guess value of the velocity field, and the resulting linear system of equations is solved by a simple direct iterative scheme (Picard iteration), with the velocity guess given by the solution at the previous iteration. Although the continuity equation is not explicitly imposed in the resulting formulation, the scheme is mass conservative because the particular solutions exactly satisfy the mass conservation equation. The proposed numerical scheme is validated by comparison of the obtained numerical results with the corresponding analytical solution of the Kovasznay flow problem at different Reynolds numbers, Re. From this analysis, it is observed that the MAPS results are stable and accurate for a wide range of shape parameter values. In addition, lid-driven cavity flow problems in rectangular and triangular domains up to Re=3200 and Re=1000, respectively, and the backward-facing step at Re=800 are solved, and the results obtained are compared with corresponding benchmark numerical solutions, showing excellent agreement. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This method consists of a discretization of the momentum equations to obtain the velocities and pressure at the faces of a finite volume, in terms of the values of these variables at the grid points followed by the integration of the momentum and continuity equations in the finite volumes. This integration leads to equations where the values of the variables at the cell faces are to be replaced by the expressions obtained at the previous stage. The linear system to be solved at each nonlinear iteration connects values of velocities and pressure at each grid point in each equation. The coefficient matrix is large, nonsymmetric, sparse, with non-null entries on the diagonal. The characteristics of these linear systems indicate the use of nonstationary iterative methods, for instance preconditioned GMRES, for their solution. The application of preconditioners based on the incomplete factorization of the system matrix will be analyzed. When nonoverlapping domain decomposition is used to parallelize this method, the system matrix at each outer iteration is in block-partitioned form. The solution of Az = b is then equivalent to the solution of the Schur complement reduced system (corresponding to the solution on the interfaces separating subdomains) followed by the update of the solution in the subdomains. Incomplete factorization preconditioners applied to S (Schur complement) are very expensive as they need the explicit construction of S. The use of other type of preconditioners based on probing techniques or approximate inverses will be considered. In the first case the preconditioner M will be a narrow band approximation of S obtained by the use of matrix-vector products only. In the second case, approximate inverse techniques allow the approximation of S by a less expensive sparse matrix to be used as a preconditioner.",

The method is based on the linearization of the discretized nonlinear equations. The convective fluxes are discretized using an O (Δx3 H) MUSCL scheme with van Leer flux-vector-splitting. Unsteady perturbations of the turbulent stresses are linearized using a frozen-turbulence-Reynolds-number hypothesis, to approximate eddy-viscosity perturbations. The resulting linear system is solved using a pseudo-time-marching implicit ADI-AF (alternating-directions-implicit approximate-factorization) procedure with local pseudo-time-steps, corresponding to a matrix-successive-underrelaxation procedure. The stability issues associated with the pseudo-time-marching solution of the time-linearized Navier-Stokes equations are discussed. Comparison of computations with measurements and with time-nonlinear computations for 3-D shock-wave oscillation in a square duct, for various back-pressure fluctuation frequencies (180, 80, 20 and 10Hz), assesses the shock-capturing capability of the time-linearized scheme.

Based on the finite difference discretization the cored for efficiently solving incompressible flows numerically is established. The reliability of the procedures is demonstrated by the application to the inviscid flow past a circular cylinder, the laminar flow over a flat plate, and steady low Reynolds number viscous incompressible flows past a circular cylinder. It is found that the solutions to the present algorithm are in good agreement with the exact solutions or experimental data. The effects of the pseudo-compressibility factor and the parameter brought by preconditioning in convergence characteristics of the solution are investigated systematically. The results show that the upwind Roe&#039;s scheme is superior to the second order central scheme, that the convergence rate of the pseudo-compressibility method can be effectively improved by preconditioning and that the self-adaptive pseudo-compressibility factor can modify the numerical convergence rate significantly compared to the constant form, without doing artificial tuning depending on the specific flow conditions. Further validation is also performed by numerical simulations of unsteady low Reynolds number viscous incompressible flows past a circular cylinder. The results are also found in good agreement with the existing numerical results or experimental data.",

The set of partial differential equations governing the motion of viscous incompressible fluid is known as nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations. This equation system is generally considered to be the fundamental description for all laminar and turbulent flows, although some statistical averaging procedure is required in practice to predict the turbulence and simulate numerically the flow at higher Reynolds number values due to the enormous computational effort needed. Various approaches exist for the turbulent flow prediction, i.e., full turbulence simulation, large eddy simulation, Reynolds averaged models, etc. Full turbulence simulation is simply the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the complete details of the turbulent flow. Such simulation is necessarily three-dimensional and time dependent. Large eddy simulation which is also three-dimensional and time dependent explicitly simulates only the largest eddies, while the small eddies are being modelled. Presently both FTS and LES are too expensive to be widely used as engineering design tools. The averaged form of the Navier-Stokes equations through the Reynolds decomposition of instantaneous value of each variable into a time averaged mean value, and an instantaneous deviation or fluctuation from the mean value is still the most commonly used approach in the numerical simulation of the engineering flow problems with turbulence. ?? 1991.",

One of the challenging issues in this context is the identification of a reliable a posteriori error estimator. Typical strategies are based on the combination of the solutions computed either with two different time steps or two schemes with different accuracy. In this paper, we move from the pressure correction algebraic factorizations formerly proposed by Saleri, Veneziani (2005). These schemes feature an intrinsic hierarchical nature, such that an accurate solution for the pressure is obtained by computing intermediate low-order guesses. The difference between the two estimates provide a natural a posteriori estimator. After introducing the incremental formulation of the pressure correction schemes, we address the properties of this approach, including extensive implementation details. Numerical results presented refer to 2D and 3D unstructured problems, with a particular emphasis on cardiovascular problems, which are expected to largely benefit from time-adaptive solvers.

The algorithm is based on a special change of dependent variables which avoids the singularity problem and provides high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accuracy and stability of the method are thoroughly tested for the model problem of transitional and turbulent flows in an infinite circular pipe. Verification of the algorithm includes two issues. First, spectral characteristics of the Hagen–Poiseuille flow stability problem are compared with those of the discrete linearized Navier–Stokes operator. Secondly, the results of direct Navier–Stokes simulation of all stages of laminar–turbulent transition in a circular pipe at Reynolds number of 4000 are presented. Time evolution of finite-amplitude disturbances of laminar flow was calculated until the statistically stationary turbulent flow regime was established. In addition to common statistical analysis, the possibility of turbulence description by means of velocity fields having certain symmetries is examined. Thus, the algorithm presented seems to be a ready-to-use robust tool for accurate investigation and further parametric studies of both transition mechanisms and fully developed turbulent flow regimes.",

Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, it is shown that in the relativistic LB model the conservation equation of the particle number is a convection-diffusion equation rather than a continuity equation, which makes the evolution of the particle number dependent on the relaxation time. Furthermore, we investigate the origin of the discontinuities that appeared in the relativistic problems with high viscosities, which were reported in a recent study [D. Hupp, M. Mendoza, I. Bouras, S. Succi, and H. Herrmann, Phys. Rev. D 84, 125015 (2011)]. A multiple-relaxation-time relativistic LB model is presented to examine the influences of different relaxation times on the discontinuities. Numerical experiments show the discontinuities can be eliminated by setting the relaxation time tau(e) (related to the bulk viscosity) to be sufficiently smaller than the relaxation time tau(nu) (related to the shear viscosity). Meanwhile, it is found that the relaxation time tau(epsilon), which has no effect on the conservation equations at the Navier-Stokes level, will affect the numerical accuracy of the relativistic LB model. Moreover, the accuracy of the relativistic LB model for simulating moderately relativistic problems is also investigated.",

For the sake of numerical accuracy, the five-point stencil convection-diffusion-reaction scheme is developed to obtain the nodally exact solution for this chosen momentum equation. The validity of the proposed mass-preserving Navier-Stokes method is justified by solving the three problems which are amenable to analytical solutions.

Our methodology is based on a semi-discrete Galerkin method invoking functional entropy variables, a generalization of classical entropy variables, and a new time integration scheme. We show that the resulting fully discrete scheme is unconditionally stable-in-energy, second-order time-accurate, and mass-conservative. We utilize isogeometric analysis for spatial discretization and verify the aforementioned properties by adopting the method of manufactured solutions and comparing coarse mesh solutions with overkill solutions. Various problems are simulated to show the capability of the method. Our methodology provides a means of constructing unconditionally stable numerical schemes for nonlinear non-convex hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

For every $\delta&gt;0$ we introduce the large deviation action functional $S^\delta_{0,T}$ and the corresponding quasi-potential $U_\delta$ and, by using arguments from relaxation and $\Gamma$-convergence we show that $U_\delta$ converges to $U=U_0$, in spite of the fact that the Navier-Stokes equation has no meaning in the space of square integrable functions, when perturbed by space-time white noise. Moreover, in the case of periodic boundary conditions the limiting functional $U$ is explicitly computed.

They are based on the concept of using the theorem to transform local boundary conditions given on the boundary of a closed region in the solution domain into global, or integral, conditions taken over it. Two formulations of the Navier-Stokes equations are considered: that in terms of the streamfunction and vorticity for two-dimensional motion and that in terms of the primitive variables of the velocity components and the pressure. In the first formulation overspecification of conditions for the streamfunction is utilized to obtain conditions of integral type for the vorticity and in the second formulation integral conditions for the pressure are found. Some illustrations of the principle of the method are given in one space dimension, including some derived from two-dimensional flows using the series truncation method. In particular, an illustration is given of the calculation of surface vorticity for two-dimensional flow normal to a flat plate. An account is also given of the implementation of these methods for general two-dimensional flows in both the mentioned formulations and a numerical illustration is given",

Unlike previous other researches, Baldwin-Lomax algebraic turbulence model is also differentiated by hand to obtain design sensitivities with respect to design variables of interest in turbulent flows. Discrete direct sensitivity equations and adjoint equations are efficiently solved by the same time integration scheme adopted in the flow solver routine. The required memory for the adjoint sensitivity code is greatly reduced at the cost of the computational time by allowing the large banded flux jacobian matrix unassembled. Direct sensitivity code results are found to be exactly coincident with sensitivity derivatives obtained by the finite difference. Adjoint code results of a turbulent flow case show slight deviations from the exact results due to the limitation of the algebraic turbulence model in implementing the adjoint formulation. However, current adjoint sensitivity code yields much more accurate sensitivity derivatives than the adjoint code with the turbulence eddy viscos- ity being kept constant, which is a usual assumption for the prior researches.",

The SSTFSI technique includes the enhancements introduced recently by the TAFSM to increase the scope, accuracy, robustness and efficiency of this class of techniques. The SSTFSI technique is supplemented with a number of special techniques developed for arterial fluid mechanics modeling. These include a recipe for pre-FSI computations that improve the convergence of the FSI computations, using an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry, and the sequentially coupled arterial FSI (SCAFSI) technique. The recipe for pre-FSI computations is based on the assumption that the arterial deformation during a cardiac cycle is driven mostly by the blood pressure. The SCAFSI technique, which was introduced as an approximate FSI approach in arterial fluid mechanics, is also based on that assumption. The need for an estimated zero-pressure arterial geometry is based on recognizing that the patient-specific image-based geometries correspond to time-averaged blood pressure values. In our arterial fluid mechanics modeling the arterial walls can be represented with the membrane or continuum elements, both of which are geometrically nonlinear, and the continuum element is made of hyperelastic (Fung) material. Test computations are presented for cerebral and abdominal aortic aneurysms, where the arterial geometries used in the computations are close approximations to the patient-specific image-based data.",

The Volterra kernels based on the impulse function concept are identified by way of the simulation of Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The computational schemes used here are validated through theoretical consideration, i.e., Blasius solution for the steady-state and Theodorsen solution for the system dynamic-state simulation. The source of nonlinearities in the aerodynamics of bluff bodies is systematically investigated. The simulation of bluff-body aerodynamics based on the Volterra reduced-order modeling scheme is obtained by the convolution of the identified kernels with the external inputs, e.g., turbulent inflow or body motion for aerodynamic or aeroelastic response, respectively. It is demonstrated that the Volterra theory-based nonlinear analysis framework for bluff-body aerodynamics combined with the identification of kernels using CFD promises to capture the salient features of bluff-body aerodynamics and offers an accurate reduced-order approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations with reduced level of computational effort.",

They are a mathematical formalization of the notion of ensemble average for turbulent flows in statistical equilibrium in time. They are also a generalization of the notion of invariant measure to the case of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, for which a global uniqueness result is not known to exist and a semigroup may not be well-defined in the classical sense. The two classical definitions of stationary statistical solutions are considered and compared, one of them being a particular case of the other and possessing a number of useful properties. Furthermore, the so-called time-average stationary statistical solutions, obtained as generalized limits of time averages of weak solutions as the averaging time goes to infinity are shown to belong to this more restrictive class. A recurrent type result is also obtained for statistical solutions satisfying an accretion condition. Finally, the weak global attractor of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is considered, and in particular it is shown that there exists a topologically large subset of the weak global attractor which is of full measure with respect to that particular class of stationary statistical solutions and which has a certain regularity property. ?? 2010 Acad??mie des sciences.",

          "abstract": "The foundation for the development of modern compressible flow solver is based on the Riemann solution of the inviscid Euler equations. The high-order schemes are basically related to high-order spatial interpolation or reconstruction. In order to overcome the low-order wave interaction mechanism due to the Riemann solution, the temporal accuracy of the scheme can be improved through the Runge-Kutta method, where the dynamic deficiencies in the first-order Riemann solution is alleviated through the sub-step spatial reconstruction in the Runge-Kutta process. The close coupling between the spatial and temporal evolution in the original nonlinear governing equations seems weakened due to its spatial and temporal decoupling. Many recently developed high-order methods require a Navier-Stokes flux function under piece-wise discontinuous high-order initial reconstruction. However, the piece-wise discontinuous initial data and the hyperbolic-parabolic nature of the Navier-Stokes equations seem inconsistent mathematically, such as the divergence of the viscous and heat conducting terms due to initial discontinuity. In this paper, based on the Boltzmann equation, we are going to present a time-dependent flux function from a high-order discontinuous reconstruction. The theoretical basis for such an approach is due to the fact that the Boltzmann equation has no specific requirement on the smoothness of the initial data and the kinetic equation has the mechanism to construct a dissipative wave structure starting from an initially discontinuous flow condition on a time scale being larger than the particle collision time. The current high-order flux evaluation method is an extension of the second-order gas-kinetic BGK scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations (BGK-NS). The novelty for the easy extension from a second-order to a higher order is due to the simple particle transport and collision mechanism on the microscopic level. This paper will present a hierarchy to construct such a high-order method. The necessity to couple spatial and temporal evolution nonlinearly in the flux evaluation can be clearly observed through the numerical performance of the scheme for the viscous flow computations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

We numerically demonstrate convergence of the BGK schemes to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and quantify the errors associated with compressibility and discretization effects. When compressibility error is smaller than discretization error, convergence in both grid spacing and time step is shown to be second-order for the LB method and is confirmed to be fourth-order for the fourth-order BGK solver. However, when the compressibility error is simultaneously reduced as the grid is refined, the LB method behaves as a first-order scheme in time.",

          "abstract": "A stabilized meshfree Galerkin method is employed for the approximation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian or arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation. Equal-order interpolations for velocities and pressure are used. It is well-known from the meshbased context, i.e. from finite volume and finite element methods, that in convection-dominated flow problems in Eulerian or ALE formulation, stabilization is a crucial requirement for reliable solutions. Also, stabilization is needed in order to enable equal-order interpolations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Standard stabilization techniques, developed in a meshbased context, are extended to meshfree methods. It is found that the same structure of the stabilization schemes may be used, however the aspect of the stabilization parameter, weighting the stabilization terms, has to be reconsidered. In Part 11 of this work, the resulting stabilized meshfree Galerkin method is coupled with a stabilized finite element method. The resulting coupled method employs the comparatively costly meshfree Galerkin method only where it is needed-i.e. in areas of the domain, where a mesh is difficult to maintain-and the efficient meshbased finite element method is used in the rest of the domain. The fluid solver resulting from this technique is able to solve complex flow problems, involving large deformations of the physical domain and/or moving and rotating obstacles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To solve the resulting system of equations, a multigrid iterative strategy on nonuniform grids is introduced by using the interpolation techniques. Numerical experiments, involving two test problems with analytical solutions and the lid-driven square cavity flow problem are carried out to display the superiority of the currently developed method on nonuniform grid. Numerical results show that the present method on nonuniform grids gets as similarly efficient convergence rate as on uniform grids, viz., second order accuracy and the resolution of the computed solutions for the problems with the sharp changes can be significantly improved when the nonuniform grid strategy is utilized. The backward-facing step flow is also calculated by the present method to exhibit the capability to simulate the distant field using fewer grid points. The solution for the natural convection problem reveals further the wide applications of the present method not only in the flow problems but also in the heat transfer problems. All of these numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the currently proposed schemes. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The accuracy of the SPH solution of the LLNS equations is demonstrated by comparing the scaling of velocity variance and the self-diffusion coefficient with kinetic temperature and particle mass obtained from the SPH simulations and analytical solutions. The spatial covariance of pressure and velocity fluctuations is found to be in a good agreement with theoretical models. To validate the accuracy of the SPH method for coupled LLNS and advection-diffusion equations, we simulate the interface between two miscible fluids. We study formation of the so-called &quot;giant fluctuations&quot; of the front between light and heavy fluids with and without gravity, where the light fluid lies on the top of the heavy fluid. We find that the power spectra of the simulated concentration field are in good agreement with the experiments and analytical solutions. In the absence of gravity, the power spectra decay as the power -4 of the wavenumber-except for small wavenumbers that diverge from this power law behavior due to the effect of finite domain size. Gravity suppresses the fluctuations, resulting in much weaker dependence of the power spectra on the wavenumber. Finally, the model is used to study the effect of thermal fluctuation on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, an unstable dynamics of the front between a heavy fluid overlaying a light fluid. The front dynamics is shown to agree well with the analytical solutions.",

The proposed scheme which is spatially fourth-order accurate is then tested on three nonlinear problems, namely (i) a problem governed by N-S equations with a constructed analytical solution, (ii) lid-driven cavity flow problem, and (iii) constricted channel flow problem. In the process, we have also expanded the scope of fourth-order 9-point compact schemes to geometries beyond rectangular. It is seen to efficiently capture steady-state solutions of the N-S equations with Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions. In addition to this, it captures viscous flows involving free and wall bounded shear layers which invariably contain spatial scale variations. Our results are in excellent agreement with analytical and numerical results whenever available and they clearly demonstrate the superior scale resolution of the proposed scheme. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "We consider the inverse problem of estimating the initial condition of a partial differential equation, which is only observed through noisy measurements at discrete time intervals. In particular, we focus on the case where Eulerian measurements are obtained from the time and space evolving vector field, whose evolution obeys the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations defined on a torus. This context is particularly relevant to the area of numerical weather forecasting and data assimilation. We will adopt a Bayesian formulation resulting from a particular regularization that ensures the problem is well posed. In the context of Monte Carlo based inference, it is a challenging task to obtain samples from the resulting high dimensional posterior on the initial condition. In real data assimilation applications it is common for computational methods to invoke the use of heuristics and Gaussian approximations. As a result, the resulting inferences are biased and not well-justified in the presence of non-linear dynamics and observations. On the other hand, Monte Carlo methods can be used to assimilate data in a principled manner, but are often perceived as inefficient in this context due to the high-dimensionality of the problem. In this work we will propose a generic Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling approach for high dimensional inverse problems that overcomes these difficulties. The method builds upon “state of the art” Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which are currently considered as benchmarks for evaluating data assimilation algorithms used in practice. SMC samplers can improve in terms of efficiency as they possess greater flexibility and one can include steps like sequential tempering, adaptation and parallelization with rela- tively low amount of extra computations. We will illustrate this using numerical examples, where our proposed SMC approach can achieve the same accuracy as MCMC but in a much more efficient manner.",

The method is based on a projection formulation in which we first solve diffusion–convection equations to predict intermediate velocities, which are then projected onto the space of divergence-free vector fields. Our treatment of the diffusion-convection step uses a specialized second-order upwind method for differencing the nonlinear convective terms that provides a robust treatment of these terms at a high Reynolds number. In contrast to conventional projection-type discretization that impose a discrete form of the divergence-free constraint, we only approximately impose the constraint; i.e., the velocity field we compute is not exactly divergence-free. The approximate projection is computed using a conventional discretization of the Laplacian and the resulting linear system is solved using conventional multigrid methods. Numerical examples are presented to validate the second-order convergence of the method for Euler, finite Reynolds number, and Stokes flow. A second example illustrating the behavior of the algorithm on an unstable shear layer is also presented.",

For a constant dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity, and at particular values of the shock Mach number, the velocity can be expressed in terms of a polynomial root. For a constant kinematic viscosity, independent of Mach number, the velocity can be expressed in terms of a hyperbolic tangent function. The remaining fluid variables are related to the velocity through simple algebraic expressions. The solutions derived here make excellent verification tests for numerical algorithms, since no source terms in the evolution equations are approximated, and the closed-form expressions are straightforward to implement. The solutions are also of some academic interest as they may provide insight into the non-linear character of the Navier-Stokes equations and may stimulate further analytical developments.",

In the latter two papers, a feasible numerical formulation of this problem, based on a Lagrange multiplier approach has been investigated. This approach has the drawback of high computational costs. In this paper, we propose an approximate formulation of this problem, yielding a strong reduction of the computational costs. The error analysis shows that the error introduced by this approximate formulation is confined in a small region of the boundary. This is confirmed by the numerical simulations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "A computer code has been developed for numerical computation of compressible turbulent Navier-Stokes equations in general curvilinear coordinates, to solve binary perfect gas mixture flows. The prepared algorithm and the computer code are capable of modeling mixture effects in different fluid flows including viscous and mass diffusion effects. The Roe&#039;s numerical scheme is used to discretize the convective terms of governing fluid flow equations and simple upwinding method is used to discretize the equation of continuity of species. A complete model for mass diffusion which consists of ordinary, thermal and pressure terms is employed. The goal of this study is to investigate effects of viscosity, mass diffusion and especially thermal diffusion, on flow fields consisting of different mixtures. It is shown that the thermal mass diffusion can have profound effect on some flow fields, especially when the temperature gradient is not small. However, pressure mass diffusion can be negligible in the most of conventional problems. ?? Published by The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this paper, we investigate possible ways to add mass diffusion to the 1-D Navier-Stokes equations without violating the basic entropy inequality. As a result, we recover Brenner&#039;s modification of the Navier-Stokes equations as a special case. We consider Brenner&#039;s system along with another modification where the viscous terms collapse to a Laplacian diffusion. For each of the two modifications, we derive a priori estimates for the PDE, sufficiently strong to admit a weak solution; we propose a numerical scheme and demonstrate that it satisfies the same a priori estimates. For both modifications, we then demonstrate that the numerical schemes generate solutions that converge to a weak solution (up to a subsequence) as the grid is refined.",

Calculations with the model support the theoretical conjecture that the difference scheme is stable whenever the analogous Cartesian scheme is stable. The scheme has been used to calculate dry atmospheric convection due to differential heating between top and bottom of mountainous terrain. The general small-scale characteristics of mountain up-slope winds have been simulated.

Simultaneous approximation terms (SAT’s) are used to enforce the boundary conditions and the coupling of block interfaces. The discrete equations are solved iter- atively with an inexact Newton method. The linear system of each Newton iteration is solved using a Krylov subspace iterative method with an approximate-Schur parallel pre- conditioner. The algorithm is validated against an established two-dimensional flow solver. Additionally, results are presented for laminar flow around the ONERAM6 wing, as well as low Reynolds number flow around a sphere. Using 384 processors, the solver is capable of obtaining the steady-state solution (reducing the flow residual by 12 orders of magnitude) on a 4.1 million node grid around the ONERA M6 wing in 4.2 minutes. Convergence to 3 significant figures in force coefficients is achieved in 83 seconds. Parallel scaling tests show that the algorithm scales well with the number of processors used. The results show that the SBP-SAT discretization, solved with the parallel Newton-Krylov-Schur algorithm, is an efficient option for three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solutions, with the SAT’s providing several advantages in enforcing boundary conditions and block coupling.",

The method involves a weak imposition of continuity conditions on the state variables and on inviscid and diffusive fluxes across inter-element and domain boundaries. Within each element the field variables are approximated using polynomial expansions with local support; therefore, this method is particularly amenable to adaptive refinements and polynomial enrichment. Moreover, the order of spectral approximation on each element can be adaptively controlled according to the regularity of the solution. The particular formulation on which the method is based makes possible a consistent implementation of boundary conditions, and the approximate solutions are locally (elementwise) conservative. The results of numerical experiments for representative benchmarks suggest that the method is robust, capable of delivering high rates of convergence, and well suited to be implemented in parallel computers.

The purpose of this paper is to justify this approximation rigorously in mathematics. That is, if the difference between the initial data for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and the Boltzmann equation is of the second order of the Knudsen number, so is the difference between two solutions for all time. The analysis is based on a refined energy method for a fluid-type system using the techniques for the system of viscous conservation laws. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "The steady, incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations are discretized using a cell vertex, finite volume method. Quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes are used to represent two- and three-dimensional geometries respectively. The dependent variables include the Cartesian components of velocity and pressure. Advective fluxes are calculated using bounded, high-resolution schemes with a deferred correction procedure to maintain a compact stencil. This treatment insures bounded, non-oscillatory solutions while maintaining low numerical diffusion. The mass and momentum equations are solved with the projection method on a non-staggered grid. The coupling of the pressure and velocity fields is achieved using the Rhie and Chow interpolation scheme modified to provide solutions independent of time steps or relaxation factors. An algebraic multigrid solver is used for the solution of the implicit, linearized equations. A number of test cases are anlaysed and presented. The standard benchmark cases include a lid-driven cavity, flow through a gradual expansion and laminar flow in a three-dimensional curved duct. Predictions are compared with data, results of other workers and with predictions from a structured, cell-centred, control volume algorithm whenever applicable. Sensitivity of results to the advection differencing scheme is investigated by applying a number of higher-order flux limiters: the MINMOD, MUSCL, OSHER, CLAM and SMART schemes. As expected, studies indicate that higher-order schemes largely mitigate the diffusion effects of first-order schemes but also shown no clear preference among the higher-order schemes themselves with respect to accuracy. The effect of the deferred correction procedure on global convergence is discussed. © 1996 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

The virtual velocity and the virtual vorticity obey diffusive equations, which reduce to passive advection formally, if the viscosity is zero. Apart from being proportional to the viscosity, the coefficients of these diffusion equations involve second derivatives of the near identity transformation and are related to the Christoffel coefficients.

The main cause for this interest is the fact that algorithms for the resulting discrete equations can be devised which require the solution of only symmetric, positive definite systems of algebraic equations. On the other hand, it is well-documented that methods using the vorticity as a primary variable often yield very poor approximations. Thus, here we study the accuracy of these methods through a series of computational experiments, and also comment on theoretical error estimates. It is found, despite the failure of standard methods for deriving error estimates, that computational evidence suggests that these methods are, at the least, nearly optimally accurate. Thus, in addition to the desirable matrix properties yielded by least-squares methods, one also obtains accurate approximations. ?? 1993.",

          "abstract": "Specific boundary conditions for the incompressible Navier- Stokes equations (INSE) and numerical boundary conditions for its numerical solution have been controversial issues in computational fluid dynamics. An attempt is made to clarify some of the problems in this work. The linear algebra approach is used on the *delta* form of the finite difference equation, leading to O( Delta t/sup 2/) results, and is extended to dimensional split and uniform boundary treatment. It is found that no numerical boundary conditions are needed, but such conditions are desirable for uniform boundary treatment. It is the author*s belief that interior and boundary schemes should be developed together, such that their properties match as much as possible. This, amongst other reasons, leads to a change from the staggered mesh to the half-staggered mesh. On this mesh, there is no half- integral differencing near the boundary and the pressure boundary condition remains unnecessary, which is mathematically correct. We derive the pressure correction projection method via approximate factorization as a fractional step method with the Crank-Nicolson scheme. We know that the INSE, upon spatial discretization, forms a differential algebraic system, and the local 2nd-order temporal accuracy of the Crank-Nicolson scheme implies global 2nd-order temporal accuracy. We show that all numerical boundary conditions considered are local 2nd-order approximations for the auxiliary velocity, which should not effect the global accuracy.

          "abstract": "An alternative vector potential formulation is used to solve the Navier–Stokes (N–S) equations in 3D incompressible viscous flow problems with and without through-flow boundaries. Difficulties of the vector potential formulation include the implementation of boundary conditions for through-flow boundaries and the numerical treatment of fourth-order partial differential equations. The advantages on the other hand are the automatic satisfaction of the continuity equation; and pressure is decoupled from the velocity. The objective of this paper is to introduce the appropriate gauge and boundary conditions on the vector potential formulation by a localized meshless method. To handle the divergence-free property, a Coulomb gauge condition is enforced on the vector potential to ensure its existence and uniqueness mathematically. We further improve the algorithm to through-flow problems for the boundary conditions of vector potential by introducing the concept of Stokes&#039; theorem. Based on this innovation, there is no need to include an additional variable to tackle the through-flow fields. This process will greatly simplify the imposition of boundary conditions by the vector potential approach. Under certain conditions, the coupled fourth-order partial differential equations can be easily solved by using this meshless local differential quadrature (LDQ) method. Due to the LDQ capability to deal with the high order differential equations, this algorithm is very attractive to solve this fourth-order vector potential formulation for the N–S equations as comparing to the conventional numerical schemes such as finite element or finite difference methods. The proposed vector potential formulation is simpler and has improved accuracy and efficiency compared to other pressure-free or pressure-coupled algorithms. This investigation can be regarded as the first complete study to obtain the N–S solutions by vector potential formulation through a LDQ method. Two classic 3D benchmark problems, lid-driven cavity and backward-facing step flows, are numerically solved to examine the feasibility of the improved algorithm. Results show the flexibility of the proposed vector potential formulation for the 3D Navier–Stokes equations.",

These equations are used to model the dynamics of a compressible fluid exhibiting liquid-vapor phase transitions. The NSK-equations are closed with a Van der Waals equation of state and contain third order nonlinear derivative terms. These contributions frequently cause standard numerical methods to violate the energy dissipation relation and require additional stabilization terms to prevent numerical instabilities. In order to address these problems we first develop an LDG method for the isothermal NSK equations using discontinuous finite element spaces combined with a time-implicit Runge-Kutta integration method. Next, we extend the LDG discretization to the non-isothermal NSK equations. An important feature of the LDG discretizations presented in this article is that they are relatively simple, robust and do not require special regularization terms. Finally, computational experiments are provided to demonstrate the capabilities, accuracy and stability of the LDG discretizations.",

The stability analysis of these long-stencil formulas cannot be directly derived from straightforward manipulations since more than one interior point is involved in the formula. The main idea of the stability analysis is to control local terms by global quantities via discrete elliptic regularity for stream function. We choose to analyze the second order scheme with Wilkes&#039; formula in detail. In this case, we can avoid the complicated technique necessitated by the Strang-type high order expansions. As a consequence, our analysis results in almost optimal regularity assumption for the exact solution. The above methodology is very general. We also give a detailed analysis for the fourth order scheme using a 1-D Stokes model.",

In using the conventional differential quadrature method for solv- ing Navier–Stokes equations, difficulties such as boundary conditions’ implementation, generation of an ill conditioned set of linear equations, large memory storage requirement to store data, and matrix coefficients, are usually encountered. Also, the solution of the generated set of equations takes a long running time and needs high computational efforts. An approach based on the point pressure–velocity iterationmethod, which is a variant of the Newton–Raphson relaxation technique, is presented to overcome these problems with- out losing accuracy. To verify its performance, four cases of two-dimensional flows in single and staggered double lid-driven cavity and flows past backward facing step and square cylinder, which have been often solved by researchers as benchmark solution, are simulated for different Reynolds numbers. The results are compared with existing solutions in the open literature. Very good agreement with low computational efforts of the approach is shown. It has been concluded that the method can be applied easily and is very time efficient.",

In this paper a discussion on the alternatives to extend PWIM to unsteady flows is presented along with a very simple criterion to ascertain if a given interpolation practice will produce steady results that are relaxation dependent or time step dependent. Following this criterion it will be shown that some prior schemes presented as time step independent are actually not, although by using special interpolations can be readily adapted to be.

          "abstract": "For fluid flow the governing equations can be solved using numerical methods. Bases of these equations are Momentum and Continuity leading to Navier-Stokes equations. There are several methods such as Simple, PISO and Fractional Step for solving these equations. In solution procedure, it needs to decide where to store the velocity components. To evaluate this, staggered and collocated grids can be used. On staggered grid, the velocity components are stored at the cell face and the scalar variables such as pressure are stored at the central nodes. However on collocated grids, all parameters are defined at the same location at the central nodes. The advantage of staggered grids is more accurate pressure gradient estimation. In collocated grids method, solving the equations is simpler as all parameters can be stored at the same location. In this paper a comparison between collocated and staggered grids for solving Navier- Stokes equations is presented. The results were validated using standard tests such as led driven cavity, channel and backward facing step. Discussion is made on accuracy of these methods to estimate horizontal and vertical velocity profiles.",

Furthermore, we derive important conclusions about the effectiveness of input field components, and the contributions of the streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise velocity perturbations to the kinetic energy density. In particular, we show that the wall-normal and spanwise forces have much stronger influence on the velocity field than the streamwise force.

The proposed algorithms are derived from an initial coarse-grained approximation that is directly computable by Monte Carlo simulations, and the corresponding numerical error is calculated using the specific relative entropy between the exact and approximate coarse-grained equilibrium measures. Subsequently we carry out a cluster expansion around this first-and often inadequate-approximation and obtain more accurate coarse-graining schemes. The cluster expansions yield also sharp a posteriori error estimates for the coarse-grained approximations that can be used for the construction of adaptive coarse-graining methods. We present a number of numerical examples that demonstrate that the coarse-graining schemes developed here allow for accurate predictions of critical behavior and hysteresis in systems with intermediate and long-range interactions. We also present examples where they substantially improve predictions of earlier coarse-graining schemes for short-range interactions.",

This new framework differs substantially in both concept and methodology from the well-established methods, i.e., finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and spectral methods. It is conceptually simple and designed to overcome several key limitations of the above traditional methods. A two-level scheme for solving the convection-diffusion equation ∂u/∂t + a ∂u/∂x - μ ∂2u/∂x2 = 0 (μ ≥ 0) is constructed and used to illuminate major differences between the present method and those mentioned above. This explicit scheme, referred to as the a-μ scheme, has two independent marching variables unj and (ux)nj which are the numerical analogues of u and ∂u/∂x at (j, n), respectively. The a-μ scheme has the unusual property that its stability is limited only by the CFL condition, i.e., it is independent of μ. Also it can be shown that the amplification factors of the a -μ scheme are identical to those of the Leapfrog scheme if μ = O, and to those of the DuFort-Frankel scheme if a = O. These coincidences are unexpected because the a-μ scheme and the above classical schemes are derived from completely different perspectives, and the a -μ scheme does not reduce to the above classical schemes in the limiting cases. The a-μ scheme is extended to solve the 1D time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations of a perfect gas. Stability of this explicit solver also is limited only by the CFL condition. In spite of the fact that it does not use (i) any techniques related to the high-resolution upwind methods, and (ii) any ad hoc parameter, the current Navier-Stokes solver is capable of generating highly accurate shock tube solutions. Particularly, for high-Reynolds-number flows, shock discontinuities can be resolved within one mesh interval. The inviscid (μ = 0) a-μ scheme is reversible in time. It also is neutrally stable, i.e., free from numerical dissipation. Such a scheme generally cannot be extended to solve the Euler equations. Thus, the inviscid version is modified. Stability of this modified scheme, referred to as the a-ε scheme, is limited by the CFL condition and 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1, where ε is a special parameter that controls numerical dissipation. Moreover, if ε = 0, the amplification factors of the a-ε scheme are identical to those of the Leapfrog scheme, which has no numerical dissipation. On the other hand, if ε = 1, the two amplification factors of the a-ε scheme become the same function of the Courant number and the phase angle. Unexpectedly, this function also is the amplification factor of the highly diffusive Lax scheme. Note that, because the Lax scheme is very diffusive and it uses a mesh that is staggered in time, a two-level scheme using such a mesh is often associated with a highly diffusive scheme. The a-ε scheme, which also uses a mesh staggering in time, demonstrates that it can also be a scheme with no numerical dissipation. The Euler extension of the a -ε scheme has stability conditions similar to those of the a -epsiv; scheme itself. It has the unusual property that numerical dissipation at all mesh points can be controlled by a set of local parameters, Moreover, it is capable of generating accurate shock tube solutions with the CFL number ranging from close to 1 to 0.022",

In 1996, Kimura and Herring \cite{KH} examined numerical simulations to show a stabilizing effect due to the stratification. They observed scattered two-dimensional pancake-shaped vortex patches lying almost in the horizontal plane. Our result is a mathematical justification of the presence of such two-dimensional pancakes. To show the existence of solutions for large times, we use $\ell^1$-norm of amplitudes. Existence for large times is then proven using techniques of fast singular oscillating limits and bootstrapping argument from a global-in-time unique solution of the system of limit equations.",

In this paper, a mesh-free computational method based on radial basis functions in a finite difference mode (RBF-FD) has been developed for the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations in stream function vorticity form. This compact RBF-FD formulation generates sparse coefficient matrices, and hence advancing solutions will in time be of comparatively lower cost. The spatial discretization of the incompressible NS equations is done using the RBF-FD method and the temporal discretization is achieved by explicit Euler time-stepping and the Crank Nicholson method. A novel ghost node strategy is used to incorporate the no-slip boundary conditions. The performance of the RBF-FD scheme with the ghost node strategy is validated against a variety of benchmark problems, including a model fluid structure interaction problem, and is found to be in a good agreement with the existing results. In addition, a higher-order RBF-FD scheme (which uses ideas from Hermite interpolation) is then proposed for solving the NS equations.",

          "abstract": "A spatial fixed ??-coordinate is used to transform the Navier-Stokes equations from the sea bed to the still water level. In the fixed ??-coordinate system only a very small number of vertical grid points are required for the numerical model. The time step for using the spatial fixed ??-coordinate is efficiently larger than that of using a time dependent ??-coordinate, as there is substantial truncation error involved in the time dependent ??-coordinate transformation. There is no need to carry out the ??-coordinate transformation at each time step, which can reduce computational times. It is important that wave breaking can be potentially modeled in the fixed ??-coordinate system, but in a time-dependent ??-coordinate system the wave breaking cannot be modeled. A projection method is used to separate advection and diffusion terms from the pressure terms in Navier-Stokes equations. The pressure variable is further separated into hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures so that the computer rounding errors can be largely avoided. In order to reduce computational time of solving the hydrodynamic pressure equation, at every time step the initial pressure is extrapolated in time domain using computed pressures from previous time steps, and then corrected in spatial domain using a multigrid method. For each time step, only a few of iterations (typically six iterations) are required for solving the pressure equation. The model is tested against available experimental data for regular and irregular waves and good agreement between calculation results and the measured data has been achieved. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The device we studied was a two-body floating-point absorber (FPA) that operates predominantly in heave and generates energy from the relative motion between the two bodies. We performed a series of numerical simulation to analyze the hydrodynamic response and the power absorption performance of the system in regular waves. Overall, it was successful to use the RANS method to model the complex hydrodynamics interaction of the FPA system. We demonstrated the significance of the nonlinear effects, including viscous damping and wave overtopping. The study showed that the nonlinear effects could significantly decrease the power output and the motion of the FPA system, particularly in larger waves. ?? 2012.",

The proposed method is based on the CDG method defined on two sets of overlapping meshes to avoid discontinuous solutions at cell interfaces, as well as the gas-kinetic BGK model to evaluate fluxes for both convection and diffusion terms. Redundant representation of the numerical solution in the CDG method offers great convenience in the design of gas-kinetic BGK fluxes. Specifically, the evaluation of fluxes at cell interfaces of one set of computational mesh is right inside the cells of the staggered mesh, hence the corresponding particle distribution function for flux evaluation is much simpler than that in existing gas-kinetic BGK methods. As a central scheme, the proposed CDG-BGK has doubled the memory requirement as the corresponding DG scheme; on the other hand, for the convection part, the CFL time step constraint of the CDG method for numerical stability is relatively large compared with that for the DG method. Numerical boundary conditions have to be treated with special care. Numerical examples for 1D and 2D viscous flow simulations are presented to validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed RK CDG-BGK method. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

The algorithm uses a fractional step approach that allows the use of equal interpolation spaces for the pressure and velocity fields and can be used to solve both compressible and incompressible flows. The standard Galerkin method is used to space-discretize the equations in which convective terms are dominant because the equations are reformulated in a characteristics co-moving frame providing thus the required artificial diffusion in a consistent way. The algorithm depends on four different parameters. Depending on their values, a fully implicit, a semi-implicit or a fully explicit solution can be obtained. The proposed algorithm may be useful in solving a wide spectrum of problems in geology, engineering and geosciences. Several flows frequently encountered in practical applications such as incompressible, slightly compressible or perfect gas are taken into account. As an example, we use it to model the withdrawal of magma from shallow chambers during explosive volcanic eruptions. Our model constitutes a first attempt to characterize the temporal evolution of the most relevant physical parameters during such a process.",

Single-particle equations, analogous to those suggested for the non-relativistic formalism are introduced. These equations may take two forms, one analogous to the Dirac-Slater and the other analogous to Dirac-Fock relativistic self-consistent field equations. The complicated relativistic many-body effects are included in the formalism via energy functionals analogous to the exchange-correlation functionals of the non-relativistic formalism. The local density approximation for these functionals is discussed and explicit expressions are given for relativistic corrections. The relation of these corrections to the Breit interaction is mentioned. The description of magnetic effects in the relativistic formalism is discussed briefly.",

          "abstract": "A generally relativistic theory of thermodynamics is developed, based on four main physical principles: heat is a local form of energy, therefore described by a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass, equivalent to conservation of heat, or the local first law; entropy is a local current; and non-destruction of entropy, or the local second law. A fluid is defined by the thermostatic energy tensor being isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other fields by certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the thermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the dissipative (thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the second law suggests certain equations for the dissipative energy tensor, generalising the Israel- Stewart dissipative relations, which describe heat conduction and viscosity including relativistic effects and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic case, the perfect-fluid model is recovered. In the linear approximation for entropy, the Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for entropy, the theory is similar to that of Israel &amp; Stewart, but involving neither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation, nor non-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics, the thermal energy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic, though this is derived in the linear approximation. Otherwise, the theory reduces in the non- relativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics of irreversible processes due to Mueller. The dissipative energy density seems to be a new thermodynamical field, but also exists in relativistic kinetic theory of gases.",

A simple derivation is presented for the gravitational spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of a relativistic particle. We discuss the gravimagnetic moment (GM), a specific spin effect in general relativity. It is shown that for the Kerr black hole the gravimagnetic ratio, i.e., the coefficient at the GM, equals unity (just as for the charged Kerr hole the gyromagnetic ratio equals two).

          "abstract": "The issue of the inviscid limit for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations when a no-slip condition is prescribed on the boundary is a famous open problem. A result by Tosio Kato says that convergence to the Euler equations holds true in the energy space if and only if the energy dissipation rate of the viscous flow in a boundary layer of width proportional to the viscosity vanishes. Of course, if one considers the motion of a solid body in an incompressible fluid, with a no-slip condition at the interface, the issue of the inviscid limit is as least as difficult. However it is not clear if the additional difficulties linked to the body&#039;s dynamic make this issue more difficult or not. In this paper we consider the motion of a rigid body in an incompressible fluid occupying the complementary set in the space and we prove that a Kato type condition implies the convergence of the fluid velocity and of the body velocity as well, what seems to indicate that an answer in the case of a fixed boundary could also bring an answer to the case where there is a moving body in the fluid.",

          "abstract": "With this paper an attempt is made to review the stability and transition simulations, performed at the University of Stuttgart, which are based on finite-difference solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations. Research in this area has demonstrated that implicit finite-difference methods for the solution of the complete Navier–Stokes equations for unsteady, two-dimensional, incompressible flows can be successfully applied to investigations of hydrodynamic stability and to certain aspects of transition. This approach of numerically solving the partial differential equations describing the underlying flow mechanisms promises to be a valuable aid in transition research. In particular, this concept may prove to be especially rewarding for investigations of aspects of stability and transition which as yet are not feasible with other theoretical models. There are two main reasons for the attractiveness of this approach: Firstly, no assumptions whatsoever have to be made concerning the basic flow field under investigation. Thus, for example, all possible effects resulting from the growth of a boundary layer in downstream direction can be included in such investigations. Even strongly converging or diverging flows, or flows with separation and/or reattachment can be studied. Secondly, no restrictions have to be made concerning amplitude and form of the disturbances which are injected into the flow. Therefore, using larger disturbance amplitudes certain nonlinear effects of the amplification process can be readily investigated. The major aspects of this approach will be discussed in this paper. Emphasis will be placed not only on conveying the advantages of such investigations but also on elaborating the difficulties and shortcomings of such numerical simulations. Finally, a conjecture concerning the course of future developments will be attempted.",

The latter has been adapted to the particular features of spectral collocation methods to develop the monodomain algorithm. In particular, pressure and velocity collocated on the same nodes are sought in a polynomial space of the same order; the cascade of scalar elliptic problems arising after the spatial collocation is solved using finite difference preconditioning. With the present procedure spurious pressure modes do not pollute the pressure field. As a natural development of the present work a multidomain extent was devised and tested. The original domain is divided into a union of patching sub-rectangles. Each scalar problem obtained after spatial collocation is solved by iterating by subdomains. For steady problems a C1 solution is recovered at the interfaces upon convergence, ensuring a spectrally accurate solution. A number of test cases have been solved to validate the algorithm in both its single-block and multidomain configurations. The preliminary results achieved indicate that collocation methods in multidomain configurations might become a viable alternative to the spectral element technique for accurate flow prediction.",

The interface motion is made partially implicit by approximating a backward Euler step in the high wavenumbers as in the small scale decomposition method of Hou, Lowengrub and Shelley. This modified step is combined with the method of Beale and Layton [J.T. Beale, A.T. Layton, A velocity decomposition approach for moving interfaces in viscous fluids, J. Comput. Phys. 228 (2009) 3358-67]; the fluid velocity is found by computing the Stokes velocity and a more regular remainder. The resulting scheme is second order in space and first order in time; it can be made second order in time by extrapolation. The discontinuities in the pressure and velocity gradient are preserved. The partially implicit method allows much larger time steps than an explicit method with negligible added effort. The formulas in the Fourier transform for the implicit approximation in high wavenumbers are similar to those derived in Hou and Shi [T.Y. Hou, Z.

In both the defect and correction steps, we use the Oseen iterative scheme to solve the discrete nonlinear equations. Furthermore, the stability and convergence of this new method are deduced, which are better than that of the classical ones.

Since the method is able to handle arbitrary forms of the geometry, many types of industrial flow problems can be simulated. In this paper the problem of green water loading on the foredeck of a ship is discussed and a comparison is made with experimental results.

          "abstract": "In the recent past, High-Performance-Computing machines and in particular Computational-Fluid-Dynamics hardware, have been dominated by architectures that mainly included clusters of processors communicating on high-speed interconnects. Since a few years though, cluster performance has reached an upper limit for many technical codes. The scalar-processor ability has saturated, and the sustained Flops often result to be only a fraction of the declared peak values. In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, the electronic industry has unveiled new trends. Since about 2004, there has been a transition taking place in high-performance scientific computing, with the advent of multicore- and manycore chips, so that the different software models for parallel programming needed to be revisited. In the present work these issues are addressed with reference to the field of fluid-flow investigation through the numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes equations. A mixed spectral-finite difference computational code for the numerical solution of the three-dimensional time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (with no forcing), is implemented on a high-performance hybrid CPU/GPGPU computing system. The computational algorithm is thought for the execution of accurate calculations at high values of the flow Reynolds number, so allowing the investigation of turbulence with the method of the Direct Numerical Simulation (no turbulence models in the system of the governing equations). The performance of different code implementations has been measured as related to the case of the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid in a plane channel, a problem that has a long tradition in the field of wall-bounded turbulence research, so becoming a reference case for the study of turbulence via Direct Numerical Simulation. Results are presented in terms of parallel performance of the computational code on different hardware partitions of the computing system, as related to corresponding different sizes of the computational grid, showing that remarkably-high computational performance is reached, mainly in virtue of the presence of the GPGPU boards in the computing-hardware architecture. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

For a particular instance of the parameters under consideration, we are able to solve the underlying partial differential equations, compute an output, and give sharp error bounds. The computations are split into an offline part, where the values of the parameters are not yet identified, but only given within a range of interest, and an online part, where the problem is solved for an instance of the parameters. The offline part is expensive and is used to build a reduced basis and prepare all the ingredients - mainly matrix-vector and scalar products, but also eigenvalue computations - necessary for the online part, which is fast. We provide a model problem - describing natural convection phenomena in a laterally heated cavity - characterized by three parameters: Grashof and Prandtl numbers and the aspect ratio of the cavity. We show the feasibility and efficiency of the a posteriori error estimation by the natural norm approach considering several test cases by varying two different parameters. The gain in terms of CPU time with respect to a parallel finite element approximation is of three magnitude orders with an acceptable - indeed less than 0.1% - error on the selected outputs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of using inner iterations is to accelerate the convergence to steady-state solutions, thereby reducing the overall CPU time. A convergence criterion is developed to assist in automating the inner iterative procedure. The ability of the line inner iterative procedure to mimic the quadratic convergence of the direct solver method is confirmed in both test problems, but some of the non-quadratic inner iterative results were more efficient than the quadratic results. In the supersonic test case, the use of inner iterations was very efficient in reducing the residual to machine zero. For this test problem, the inner iteration method required only about 65% of the CPU time which was required by the most efficient line relaxation method without inner iterations. In the subsonic test case, poor matrix conditioning forced the use of under-relaxation in order to obtain convergence of the inner iterations, resulting in an overall method which was less efficient than line relaxation methods which employ a more conventional CPU savings strategy. ?? 1992.",

          "abstract": "Fluid flow through a significantly compressed elastic tube occurs in a variety of physiological situations. Laboratory experiments investigating such flows through finite lengths of tube mounted between rigid supports have demonstrated that the system is one of great dynamical complexity, displaying a rich variety of self-excited oscillations. The physical mechanisms responsible for the onset of such oscillations are not yet fully understood, but simplified models indicate that energy loss by flow separation, variation in longitudinal wall tension and propagation of fluid elastic pressure waves may all be important. Direct numerical solution of the highly non-linear equations governing even the most simplified two-dimensional models aimed at capturing these basic features requires that both the flow field and the domain shape be determined as part of the solution, since neither is known a priori. To accomplish this, previous algorithms have decoupled the solid and fluid mechanics, solving for each separately and converging iteratively on a solution which satisfies both. This paper describes a finite element technique which solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equatikons simultaneously with the elastic membrane equations on the flexible boundary. The elastic boundary position is parametized in terms of distances along spines in a manner similar to that which has been used successfully in studies of viscous free surface flows, but here the membrane curvature equation rather than the kinematic boundary condition of vanishing normal velocity is used to determine these diatances and the membrane tension varies with the shear stresses exerted on it by the fluid motions. Bothy the grid and the spine positions adjust in response to membrane deformation, and the coupled fluid and elastic equations are solved by a Newton-Raphson scheme which displays quadratic convergence down to low membrane tensions and extreme states of collapse. Solutions to the steady problem are discussed, along with an indication of how the time-dependent problem might be approached.",

An implementation using polynomial bases is described that permits the use of approximations that exactly satisfy the solenoidal requirement. A Galerkin basis is constructed and, starting with the solution of the associated Stokes problem, Newton&#039;s method can be used to generate an approximate solution. A unique solution exists if the viscosity is sufficiently large; here an a posteriori computation is described that tests if uniqueness is likely to hold and gives an error estimate showing closeness of the approximation.

          "abstract": "Direct numerical simulation of a coagulating aerosol in a two-dimensional, incompressible, iso-thermal shear layer is performed. The evolution of the particle field is obtained by utilizing a nodal model to approximate the aerosol general dynamic equation (GDE). The GDE is written in discrete form as a population balance on each particle size and describes particle dynamics under the influence of various physical phenomena: convection, diffusion, and coagulation. The nodal approach is advantageous in that there are no a priori assumptions regarding the nature of the particle size distribution and therefore does not suffer from the severe constraints of other methodologies. This approach divides the particle size distribution into &quot;bins,&quot; for each of which a transport equation is obtained. A coagulation Damk??hler number is defined to represent the ratio of the convective time scale to the coagulation time scale. Simulations are performed at a Reynolds number of 200 and coagulation Damk??hler numbers of 1 and 10. The nanoparticle field is presented as a function of space, time and size. Results indicate that strong spatial variations in the particle concentrations develop in time and that these spatial gradients act to increase the geometric standard deviation of the particle size distribution. As the coagulation Damk??hler number is increased, particle growth increases and particle size distributions wider than the self-preserving limit are predicted. The capture of the evolution of the particle field as a function of space, time and size suggests that the methodology is sufficiently general and robust to be useful in predicting the growth and dynamics in inhomogeneous, and possibly, turbulent flows. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The new algorithm consists of two time steps is a simulation cycle: a Lagrangian convection simulation for the first time step and a diffusion simulation through the use of new vortex points at dixed Eulerian mesh points for the second time step. The mathematical mechanisms of computation behind this algorithm, and its characteristics of convergence and accuracy, are analyzed in applications for the following problems: (1) an initial value problem involving the decay of a single vortex of finite size and the decay and interaction of a vortex-pair of two finite-core regions; (2) a boundary value problem: the unsteady flow field around a rotating cylinder with high Reynolds number up to Red = U ?? D/v &lt; 10,000. Numerical results are compared with either exact solutions or other numerical methods. The numerical advantages of the diffusing-vortex scheme over other conventional vortex methods, Cloud-in-Cell methods, particle methods, and some finite difference schemes are evaluated in terms of reducing total CPU time, avoiding cutoff procedures, and sidestepping various interpolations. ?? 1991.",

For fluid-type motions such as smoke or clouds, the constant brightness assumption does not hold, and accurately estimating the motion flow from their images is difficult. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective Navier-Stokes (NS) potential flow model for recovering fluid-type motions. Our method treats the image as a wavefront surface and models the 3D potential flow beneath the surface. The gradient of the velocity potential describes the motion flow at every voxel. We first derive a general brightness constraint that explicitly models wavefront (brightness) variations in terms of the velocity potential. We then use a series of partial differential equations to separately model the dynamics of the potential flow. To solve for the potential flow, we use the Dirichlet-Neumann Operator (DNO) to simplify the 3D volumetric velocity potential to 2D surface velocity potential. We approximate the DNO via Taylor expansions and develop a Fourier domain method to efficiently estimate the Taylor coefficients. Finally we show how to use the DNO to recover the velocity potential from images as well as to propagate the wavefront (image) over time. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images show that our technique is robust and reliable.",

Although many researchers believe that this interaction triggers transition to turbulence in flow systems, the role of the nonlinearity in this process has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper is the second of a two part work in which sensitivity analysis is used to study the effects of small disturbances on the transition process. In the first part, sensitivity analysis was used to predict the effects of a small disturbance on solutions of a motivating problem, a highly sensitive one-dimensional Burgers&#039; equation. In this paper, we extend the analysis to study the effects of small disturbances on transition to turbulence in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. We show that the change in a laminar flow with respect to small variations in the initial flow or small forcing acting on the system is large when the linearized operator is stable yet nonnormal. In this case, the solution of the disturbed problem can be very large (and potentially turbulent) even if the disturbances are extremely small. We also give bounds on the disturbed flow in terms of certain constants associated with the linearized operator. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Immersed Boundary Methods (IBMs) are a class of methods in Computational Fluid Dynamics where the grids do not conform to the shape of the body. Instead they employ Cartesian meshes and alternative ways to incorporate the boundary conditions in the (discrete) governing equations. The simple grids and data structure are very well suited to handle complex geometries and moving boundaries. The ma\r\nin objective of this project was to investigate Immersed Boundary Methods through literature study, brief analysis and numerical experiments, to gain experience and knowledge on the topic and to lay the foundations for practical use of these methods in future research. The approach that was taken to meet the objectives can be split into three parts: a literature study, a simple 1D channel-flow study and a 2D steady Navier-Stokes study. The literature study presents the\r\nbasic IBM techniques and a brief historical overview, followed by a discussion on some important properties of IBMs. Based on a structured classification of existing methods, a choice is made on the type of Immersed Boundary Methods to be explored in the 1D numerical study. The 1D study makes use of the Poiseuille low problem as a test case, since it has an analytical solution which allows us to calculate the absolute error made by the developed IBMs. The study of three new and two existing 1D methods and their derived variants reveals their accuracy on different grids and shows that this accuracy can be substantially affected by the position of an immersed boundary with respect to the neighboring grid points. The construction of a steady 2D Navier-Stokes code provided an opportunity to test some of the findings from the 1D numerical study in a higher dimension. A lot of effort was put in constructing the pre-processor, which creates the cartesian grid and determines the intersections of the grid lines with the immersed boundary. Additional parameters are defined to create a data structure that allows the IBMs to deal with immersed bodies effectively. The current pre-processor can handle most body shapes fully automatically. Thin, wedge-like shapes (e.g. airfoil trailing edges) still need a little bit of hand-coding. Three IBMs are successfully implemented in an existing 2D first-order finite volume code for the Navier-Stokes equations. These Immersed Boundary Methods are tested on three test cases: a backward-facing step flow, a circular cylinder flow\r\nin a channel and a multi-element airfoil flow. The results show that Immersed Boundary Methods are able to treat different boundaries in a satisfying manner.\r\nThe qualitative aspects of the flows are captured well. Moreover, the grid generation is very straightforward and fast, even for the multi-element airfoil. The recommendations include suggestions on improving the pre-processor, on speeding up the steady solution method and on transforming the present code into an unsteady solver",

The derivation is based on the equations of linear elasticity in the solid, the linearized Navier–Stokes equations in the fluid, and appropriate conditions at the solid–fluid boundary. The scale of the pores is assumed to be small compared to the macroscopic scale, so that the two‐space method of homogenization can be used to deduce the macroscopic equations. When the dimensionless viscosity of the fluid is small, the resulting equations are those of Biot, who obtained them by hypothesizing the form of the macroscopic constitutive relations. The present derivation verifies those relations, and shows how the coefficients in them can be calculated, in principle, from the microstructure. When the dimensionless viscosity is of order one, a different equation is obtained, which is that of a viscoelastic solid.",

These systems are of the so-called saddle point type, which means that there is a large block of zeros on the main diagonal. To solve these types of systems efficiently, several block preconditioners have been published. These types of preconditioners require adaptation of standard finite element packages. The alternative is to apply a standard ILU preconditioner in combination with a suitable renumbering of unknowns. We introduce a reordering technique for the degrees of freedom that makes the application of ILU relatively fast. We compare the performance of this technique with some block preconditioners. The performance appears to depend on grid size, Reynolds number and quality of the mesh. For medium-sized problems, which are of practical interest, we show that the reordering technique is competitive with the block preconditioners. Its simple implementation makes it worthwhile to implement it in the standard finite element method software. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

A reformulation of the VHD system using entropy variables allows to end up with a quasi-linear form that is symmetric and for which a stability result (in form of Clausius-Duhem inequality) is proved to hold. The numerical approximation of the VHD model is then performed using a Time-Discontinuous Galerkin Least-Squares finite element formulation including a discontinuity shock-capturing operator and based on a fully unstructured tetrahedral decomposition of the device domain. The approach combines in a unified framework the stability and optimality features of the standard Galerkin method with the ability of the scheme in effectively coping with the strong variations attained by the solution throughout the semiconductor device, as is demonstrated by numerical results in the simulation of several benchmark problems subject to quite different boundary conditions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The method extends a stable staggered grid finite difference scheme to the graded octree meshes. It is found that a straightforward extension is prone to produce spurious oscillatory velocity modes on the fine-to-coarse grids interfaces. A local linear low-pass filter is shown to reduce much of the bad influence of the interface modes on the accuracy of numerical solution. We introduce an implicit upwind finite difference approximation of advective terms as a low dissipative and stable alternative to semi-Lagrangian methods to treat the transport part of the equations. The performance of method is verified for a set of benchmark tests: a Beltrami type flow, the 3D lid-driven cavity and channel flows over a 3D square cylinder. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Our approach is based on the micro/macro decomposition technique, which applies to general collision operators. This decomposition is performed in all the phase space and leads to an equivalent formulation of the Boltzmann (or BGK) equation that couples a kinetic equation with macroscopic ones. This new formulation is then discretized with a semi-implicit time scheme combined with a staggered grid space discretization. Finally, several numerical tests are presented in order to illustrate the efficiency of our approach. Incidentally, we also introduce in this paper a modification of a standard splitting method that allows to preserve the compressible Navier-Stokes asymptotics in the case of the simplified BGK model.

The bound state is described by a wave function depending on separate times for each of the two particles. Two alternative integral equations for this wave function are derived with kernels in the form of an expansion in powers of g2, the dimensionless coupling constant for the interaction. Each term in these expansions gives Lorentz-invariant equations. The validity and physical significance of these equations is discussed. In extreme nonrelativistic approximation and to lowest order in g2 they reduce to the appropriate Schrödinger equation. One of these integral equations is applied to the deuteron ground state using scalar mesons of mass μ with scalar coupling. For neutral mesons the Lorentz-invariant interaction is transformed into the sum of the instantaneous Yukawa interaction and a retarded correction term. The value obtained for g2 differs only by a fraction proportional to (μ/M)2 from that obtained by using a phenomenological Yukawa potential. For a purely charged meson theory a correction term is obtained by a direct solution of the relativistic integral equation using only the first term in the expansion of the kernel. This correction is due to the fact that a nucleon can emit, or absorb, positive and negative mesons only alternately. The constant g2 is increased by a fraction of 1.1(μ/M) or 15 percent.",

          "abstract": "Hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large eddy simulation (RANS/LES) is expected to accurately predict wall-bounded turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers. It is known that extra terms due to the noncommutivity between the hybrid filter and the spatial derivative appear in the hybrid-filtered equations. In this paper the filtered Navier–Stokes equation is investigated using direct numerical simulation data of turbulent channel flow. In particular, the transport equations for the resolved and modeled energies are evaluated to examine the contribution of the extra terms. The RANS and LES regions are located by setting the width of the hybrid filter varying from the grid spacing to the channel half width. In the first case the RANS region is located near the wall for wall modeling in LES. In the second case the RANS and LES regions are located upstream and downstream, respectively. The extra terms in the Navier–Stokes and continuity equations show fairly large values in the RANS/LES interface region in both cases. The extra terms for the convection and the turbulent diffusion represent the energy transfer from the modeled part to the resolved part. This energy transfer suggests that conventional hybrid simulations neglecting the extra terms may underpredict velocity fluctuations in the interface region, causing an insufficient momentum transport and velocity mismatch in channel flow. These results show that the effect of the extra terms should be taken into account in the filtered Navier–Stokes equation as well as in the turbulent-energy equation in hybrid simulations.",

          "abstract": "We describe a procedure for large eddy simulations of turbulence which uses the subgrid-scale estimation model and truncated Navier–Stokes dynamics. In the procedure the large eddy simulation equa- tions are advanced in time with the subgrid-scale stress tensor calculated from the parallel solution of the truncated Navier–Stokes equations on a mesh two times smaller in each Cartesian direction than the mesh employed for a discretization of the resolved quantities. The truncated Navier–Stokes equations are solved through a sequence of runs, each initialized using the subgrid-scale estimation model. The modeling pro- cedure is evaluated by comparing results of large eddy simulations for isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel ﬂow with the corresponding results of experiments, theory, direct numerical simulations, and other large eddy simulations. Subsequently, simpliﬁcations of the general procedure are discussed and evalu- ated. In particular, it is possible to formulate the procedure entirely in terms of the truncated Navier–Stokes equation and a periodic processing of the small-scale component of its solution.",

The reason is that the Lq-theory for the Stokes operator A is available in general only in the Hilbert space setting, i.e., with q = 2. Our main result for a general domain Ω is optimal in a certain sense: Consider an initial value u0 ∈ Lσ2 (Ω) and a zero external force. Then the condition ∫0∞ {norm of matrix} e- t A u0 {norm of matrix}48 d t &lt; ∞ is sufficient and necessary for the existence of a unique local strong solution u ∈ L8 (0, T ; L4 (Ω)) in some interval [0, T), 0 &lt; T ≤ ∞, with u (0) = u0, satisfying Serrin&#039;s condition frac(2, 8) + frac(3, 4) = 1. Note that Fujita-Kato&#039;s sufficient condition u0 ∈ D (A1 / 4) is strictly stronger and therefore not optimal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The pressure in the incompressible three-dimensional Navier–Stokes and Euler equations is governed by Poisson&#039;s equation: this equation is studied using the geometry of three-forms in six dimensions. By studying the linear algebra of the vector space of three-forms Λ3W* where W is a six-dimensional real vector space, we relate the characterization of non-degenerate elements of Λ3W* to the sign of the Laplacian of the pressure—and hence to the balance between the vorticity and the rate of strain. When the Laplacian of the pressure, Δp, satisfies Δp&gt;0, the three-form associated with Poisson&#039;s equation is the real part of a decomposable complex form and an almost-complex structure can be identified. When Δp&lt;0, a real decomposable structure is identified. These results are discussed in the context of coherent structures in turbulence.",

The solution is based on the concept of the continuum approach using the Chapman-Enskog method, but built upon the proposal to introduce a hyperbolic tangent function of Kn number in the power series of the distribution function and slip boundary condition. The physics behind the mathematical modification are discussed. With the slip boundary condition accurate to O(tanh(Kn)), the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is extended successfully to the transition flow regime. The analytic solutions are compared with results of DSMC in both slip flow and transition flow regimes. Satisfactory agreements on the velocity profiles and pressure distributions have been achieved. The extension of the upper Knudsen number limits of continuum approach is significant in molecular gas dynamics.",
