The dual geometry has an intrinsically flat timelike boundary segment $\Sigma_c$ whose extrinsic curvature is given by the stress tensor of the Navier-Stokes fluid. We consider a &quot;near-horizon&quot; limit in which $\Sigma_c$ becomes highly accelerated. The near-horizon expansion in gravity is shown to be mathematically equivalent to the hydrodynamic expansion in fluid dynamics, and the Einstein equation reduces to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. For $p=2$, we show that the full dual geometry is algebraically special Petrov type II. The construction is a mathematically precise realization of suggestions of a holographic duality relating fluids and horizons which began with the membrane paradigm in the 70&#039;s and resurfaced recently in studies of the AdS/CFT correspondence.",

Fluid dynamics considers the physics of liquids and gases. This is a branch of classical physics and is totally based on Newton’s laws of motion. Never- theless, the equation of fluid motion, Navier-Stokes equation, becomes very complicated to solve even for very simple configurations. This thesis treats mainly analytical vortex solutions to Navier-Stokes equations. Vorticity is usually concentrated to smaller regions of the flow, sometimes isolated ob- jects, called vortices. If one are able to describe vortex structures exactly, important information about the flow properties are obtained. Initially, the modeling of a conical vortex geometry is considered. The results are compared with wind-tunnel measurements, which have been an- alyzed in detail. The conical vortex is a very interesting phenomenaon for building engineers because it is responsible for very low pressures on build- ings with flat roofs. Secondly, a suggested analytical solution to Navier- Stokes equation for internal flows is presented. This is based on physi- cal argumentation concerning the vorticity production at solid boundaries. Also, to obtain the desired result, Navier-Stokes equation is reformulated and integrated. In addition, a model for required information of vorticity production at boundaries is proposed. The last part of the thesis concerns the examples of vortex models in 2-D and 3-D. In both cases, analysis of the Navier-Stokes equation, leads to the opportunity to construct linear solutions. The 2-D studies are, by the use of diffusive elementary vortices, describing experimentally observed vortex statistics and turbulent energy spectrums in stratified systems and in soap- films. Finally, in the 3-D analysis, three examples of recent experimentally observed vortex objects are reproduced theoretically. First, coherent struc- tures in a pipe flow is modeled. These vortex structures in the pipe are of interest since they appear for Re in the range where transition to turbulence is expected. The second example considers the motion in a viscous vortex ring. The model, with diffusive properties, describes the experimentally measured velocity field as well as the turbulent energy spectrum. Finally, a streched spiral vortex is analysed. A rather general vortex model that has many degrees of freedom is proposed, which also may be applied in other configurations.",

The tensor character of the stress is central to the derivation. In particular, a linear relation between stress and strain rate is assumed only for the shear, rather than for the full stress tensor as is done in most other derivations. An assumption for the shear is naturally simpler and easier to verify experimentally. The use of tensor analysis is shown to greatly simplify the derivation.",

The work is an extension of a previously proposed formulation. Conventional lattice Boltzmann models can be shown to be directly derivable from this systematic approach. Furthermore, we provide here a clear and rigorous procedure for obtaining higher-order approximations to the continuum Boltzmann equation. The resulting macroscopic moment equations at each level of the systematic discretization give rise to the Navier–Stokes hydrodynamics and those beyond. In addition, theoretical indications to the order of accuracy requirements are given for each discrete approximation, for thermohydrodynamic systems, and for fluid systems involving long-range interactions. All these are important for complex and micro-scale flows and are missing in the conventional Navier–Stokes order descriptions. The resulting discrete Boltzmann models are based on a kinetic representation of the fluid dynamics, hence the drawbacks in conventional higher-order hydrodynamic formulations can be avoided.",

In this paper, we consider a modification $\partial_t u = \Delta u + \tilde B(u,u)$ of this equation, where $\tilde B$ is an averaged version of the bilinear operator $B$ (where the average involves rotations and Fourier multipliers of order zero), and which also obeys the cancellation condition $\langle \tilde B(u,u), u \rangle = 0$ (so that it obeys the usual energy identity). By analysing a system of ODE related to (but more complicated than) a dyadic Navier-Stokes model of Katz and Pavlovic, we construct an example of a smooth solution to such a averaged Navier-Stokes equation which blows up in finite time. This demonstrates that any attempt to positively resolve the Navier-Stokes global regularity problem in three dimensions has to use finer structure on the nonlinear portion $B(u,u)$ of the equation than is provided by harmonic analysis estimates and the energy identity. We also propose a program for adapting these blowup results to the true Navier-Stokes equations.",

The main idea is to think of the image intensity as a &#039;stream function for a two-dimensional incompressible flow. The Laplacian of the image intensity plays the role of the vorticity of the fluid; it is transported into the region to be inpainted by a vector field defined by the stream function. The resulting algorithm is designed to continue isophotes while matching gradient vectors at the boundary of the inpainting region. The method is directly based on the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics, which has the immediate advantage of well-developed theoretical and numerical results.

On the other hand, recent studies indicate that the theory of continuum breaks down only at the nanometer level; consequently flows through nanotubes still can be investigated with Navier-Stokes equations if we take suitable boundary conditions into account. The aim of this paper is to study the statics and dynamics of liquids in nanotubes by using methods of nonlinear continuum mechanics. We assume that the nanotube is filled with only a liquid phase; by using a second gradient theory the static profile of the liquid density in the tube is analytically obtained and compared with the profile issued from molecular dynamics simulation. Inside the tube there are two domains: a thin layer near the solid wall where the liquid density is non-uniform and a central core where the liquid density is uniform. In the dynamic case a closed form analytic solution seems to be no more possible, but by a scaling argument it is shown that, in the tube, two distinct domains connected at their frontiers still exist. The thin inhomogeneous layer near the solid wall can be interpreted in relation with the Navier length when the liquid slips on the boundary as it is expected by experiments and molecular dynamics calculations.",

          "abstract": "It has been known for several decades that Einstein&#039;s field equations, when projected onto a null surface, exhibits a structure very similar to non-relativistic Navier-Stokes equation. I show that this result arises quite naturally when gravitational dynamics is viewed as an emergent phenomenon. Extremising the spacetime entropy density associated with the null surfaces leads to a set of equations which, when viewed in the local inertial frame, becomes identical to the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation. This is in contrast with the usual description of Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation in a general coordinate system, in which there appears a Lie derivative rather than convective derivative. I discuss this difference, its importance and why it is more appropriate to view the equation in a local inertial frame. The viscous force on fluid, arising from the gradient of the viscous stress-tensor, involves the second derivatives of the metric and does not vanish in the local inertial frame while the viscous stress-tensor itself vanishes so that inertial observers detect no dissipation. We thus provide an entropy extremisation principle that leads to the DNS equation, which makes the hydrodynamical analogy with gravity completely natural and obvious. Several implications of these results are discussed.",

The Navier-Stokes solution is constructed through a composite asymptotic expansion involving the solutions of the Euler and Prandtl equations, which were constructed in the first paper, plus an error term. This shows that the Navier-Stokes solution goes to an Euler solution outside a boundary layer and to a solution of the Prandtl equations within the boundary layer. The error term is written as a sum of first order Euler and Prandtl corrections plus a further error term. The equation for the error term is weakly nonlinear; its linear part is the time dependent Stokes equation. This error equation is solved by inversion of the Stokes equation, through expressing the solution as a regular (Euler-like) part plus a boundary layer (Prandtl-like) part. The main technical tool in this analysis is the Abstract Cauchy-Kowalewski Theorem.",

The model is based on the k-ω framework and represents a substantial refinement to a transition-sensitive model that has been previously documented in the open literature. The third transport equation is included to predict the magnitude of low-frequency velocity fluctuations in the pretransitional boundary layer that have been identified as the precursors to transition. The closure of model terms is based on a phenomenological (i.e., physics-based) rather than a purely empirical approach and the rationale for the forms of these terms is discussed. The model has been implemented into a commercial computational fluid dynamics code and applied to a number of relevant test cases, including flat plate boundary layers with and without applied pressure gradients, as well as a variety of airfoil test cases with different geometries, Reynolds numbers, freestream turbulence conditions, and angles of attack. The test cases demonstrate the ability of the model to successfully reproduce transitional flow behavior with a reasonable degree of accuracy, particularly in comparison with commonly used models that exhibit no capability of predicting laminar-to-turbulent boundary layer development. While it is impossible to resolve all of the complex features of transitional and turbulent flows with a relatively simple Reynolds-averaged modeling approach, the results shown here demonstrate that the new model can provide a useful and practical tool for engineers addressing the simulation and prediction of transitional flow behavior in fluid systems.",

The holographic RG flow is a system of first order differential equations for radial evolution of the energy-momentum tensor and the variables which parametrize it&#039;s phenomenological form on hypersurfaces in a foliation. The RG flow can be constructed without explicit knowledge of the bulk metric provided the hypersurface foliation is of a special kind. The bulk metric can be reconstructed once the RG flow equations are solved. We show that the full spacetime can be determined from the RG flow by requiring that the horizon fluid is a fixed point in a certain scaling limit leading to the non-relativistic incompressible Navier-Stokes dynamics. This restricts the near-horizon forms of all transport coefficients, which are thus determined independently of their asymptotic values and the RG flow can be solved uniquely. We are therefore able to recover the known boundary values of almost all transport coefficients at the first and second orders in the derivative expansion. We conjecture that the complete characterisation of the general holographic RG flow, including the choice of counterterms, might be determined from the hydrodynamic regime.",

We presently investigate the impact of this technology on our computational fluid dynamics solver for the three-dimensional two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which is based on the level set technique and applies Chorin’s projection approach. To our knowledge, this is the first time, that a two-phase solver for the Navier-Stokes equations profits from the computation power of modern graphics hardware. As part of our project, a Jacobi preconditioned conjugate gradient solver for the pressure Poisson equation and the reinitialization of the level set function of our CPU based code were ported to the graphics processing unit (GPU). They are implemented in double precision and parallelized by the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We obtain speedups of 16.2 and 8.6 for the Poisson solver and the reinitialization on one GPU in contrast to a single CPU. Our implementation scales close to perfect on multiple GPUs of a distributed memory cluster. This results in excellent speedups of 115.8 and 53.7 on eight GPUs of our cluster. Furthermore our whole multi-GPU accelerated solver achieves an impressive speedup of 69.6 on eight GPUs/CPUs.",

The truncated Navier–Stokes equations are solved through a sequence of runs, each initialized using the subgrid-scale estimation model. The modeling pro- cedure is evaluated by comparing results of large eddy simulations for isotropic turbulence and turbulent channel ﬂow with the corresponding results of experiments, theory, direct numerical simulations, and other large eddy simulations. Subsequently, simpliﬁcations of the general procedure are discussed and evalu- ated. In particular, it is possible to formulate the procedure entirely in terms of the truncated Navier–Stokes equation and a periodic processing of the small-scale component of its solution.",

The approach involves truncating the Cartesian cells at the boundary surface to create new cells which conform to the shape of the surface. We discuss in some detail the problems unique to the development of a cut cell method on a staggered grid. Methods for calculating the fluxes through the boundary cell faces, for representing pressure forces and for calculating the wall shear stress are derived and it is verified that the new scheme retains second-order accuracy in space. In addition, a novel &quot;cell-linking&quot; method is developed which overcomes problems associated with the creation of small cells while avoiding the complexities involved with other cell-merging approaches. Techniques are presented for generating the geometric information required for the scheme based on the representation of the boundaries as quadric surfaces. The new method is tested for flow through a channel placed oblique to the grid and flow past a cylinder at Re = 40 and is shown to give significant improvement over a staircase boundary formulation. Finally, it is used to calculate unsteady flow past a hemispheric protuberance on a plate at a Reynolds number of 800. Good agreement is obtained with experimental results for this flow. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

In the case where H is spacelike or null and the 2-surfaces are marginally trapped, this identity applies to Hayward&#039;s trapping horizons and to the related dynamical horizons recently introduced by Ashtekar and Krishnan. The identity involves a normal fundamental form (normal connection 1-form) of the 2-surface, which can be viewed as a generalization to non-null hypersurfaces of the Hajicek 1-form used by Damour. This 1-form is also used to define the angular momentum of the horizon.

By a combination of order-of-magnitude analysis, appeal to available analytical solutions, and reanalysis of some data from the literature, it is shown that the Navier-Stokes equations can be linearized if the Reynolds number is less than about 10. Further analysis shows that the linear Stokes equations can be replaced by the simpler Reynolds lubrication equation if the wavelength of the dominant aperture variations is about three times greater than the mean aperture. However, this criterion does not seem to be strongly obeyed by all fractures. The Reynolds equation (i.e., the local cubic law) may therefore suffice in estimating fracture permeabilities to within a factor of about 2, but more accurate estimates will require solution of the Stokes equations. Similarly, estimates of mean aperture based on inverting transmissivity data may have errors of a factor of two if any version of the local cubic law is used to relate transmissivity to mean aperture.",

In this paper, two kinds of schemes are studied and compared: the classical approach based on high order schemes for Navier-Stokes-like equations and the lattice Boltzmann method. The reference macroscopic equations are the 3D isothermal and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A Von Neumann analysis of these linearized equations is carried out to obtain exact plane wave solutions. Three physical modes are recovered and the corresponding theoretical dispersion relations are obtained. Then the same analysis is made on the space and time discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations with the classical high order schemes to quantify the influence of both space and time discretization on the exact solutions. Different orders of discretization are considered, with and without a uniform mean flow. Three different lattice Boltzmann models are then presented and studied with the Von Neumann analysis. The theoretical dispersion relations of these models are obtained and the error terms of the model are identified and studied. It is shown that the dispersion error in the lattice Boltzmann models is only due to the space and time discretization and that the continuous discrete velocity Boltzmann equation yield the same exact dispersion as the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, dispersion and dissipation errors of the different kind of schemes are quantitatively compared. It is found that the lattice Boltzmann method is less dissipative than high order schemes and less dispersive than a second order scheme in space with a 3-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time. The number of floating point operations at a given error level associated with these two kinds of schemes are then compared. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The pressure is treated explicitly in time, completely decoupling the computation of the momentum and kinematic equations. The result is a class of extremely efficient Navier-Stokes solvers. Full time accuracy is achieved for all flow variables. The key to the schemes is a Neumann boundary condition for the pressure Poisson equation which enforces the incompressibility condition for the velocity field. Irrespective of explicit or implicit time discretization of the viscous term in the momentum equation the explicit time discretization of the pressure term does not affect the time step constraint. Indeed, we prove unconditional stability of the new formulation for the Stokes equation with explicit treatment of the pressure term and first or second order implicit treatment of the viscous term. Systematic numerical experiments for the full Navier-Stokes equations indicate that a second order implicit time discretization of the viscous term, with the pressure and convective terms treated explicitly, is stable under the standard CFL condition. Additionally, various numerical examples are presented, including both implicit and explicit time discretizations, using spectral and finite difference spatial discretizations, demonstrating the accuracy, flexibility and efficiency of this class of schemes.

Here, we solve the flow past cylinder(s) using single-block structured and overset grids by computing Navier-Stokes equation in two-dimensions. The suitability of a compact scheme in discretizing convection and diffusion terms are investigated first by looking at relevant numerical properties. Also, for the overset grid method, one of the methods is identified that shows the best results in minimizing interpolation error at sub-domain boundaries for an analytical test function. We provide extensive comparisons with experimental and other computational results for flow past a single cylinder, utilizing both single-block structured and Chimera or overset grids. Apart from showing instability of this flow calculated by these methods, we also compare the computed vorticity and velocity data using these two grids by employing the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We have analyzed and developed an overset grid method with compact scheme that does not need any filtering to control error. This has been ascertained by performing POD analysis. To show that the developed method is capable of handling complex geometries, we have computed flow past two cylinders in side-by-side arrangement. Results obtained capture the known flow characteristics for this arrangement well using relatively fewer number of grid points. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "We develop a continuum-mechanical formulation and generalization of the Navier–Stokes-α equation based on a recently developed framework for fluid-dynamical theories involving higher-order gradient dependencies. Our flow equation involves two length scales α and β. The first of these enters the theory through the specific free-energy α 2|D|2, where D is the symmetric part of the gradient of the filtered velocity, and contributes a dispersive term to the flow equation. The remaining scale is associated with a dissipative hyperstress which depends linearly on the gradient of the filtered vorticity and which contributes a viscous term, with coefficient proportional to β 2, to the flow equation. In contrast to Lagrangian averaging, our formulation delivers boundary conditions and a complete structure based on thermodynamics applied to an isothermal system. For a fixed surface without slip, the standard no-slip condition is augmented by a wall-eddy condition involving another length scale ℓ characteristic of eddies shed at the boundary and referred to as the wall-eddy length. As an application, we consider the classical problem of turbulent flow in a plane, rectangular channel of gap 2h with fixed, impermeable, slip-free walls and make comparisons with results obtained from direct numerical simulations. We find that α/β ~ Re 0.470 and ℓ/h ~ Re −0.772, where Re is the Reynolds number. The first result, which arises as a consequence of identifying the specific free-energy with the specific turbulent kinetic energy, indicates that the choice β = α required to reduce our flow equation to the Navier–Stokes-α equation is likely to be problematic. The second result evinces the classical scaling relation η/L ~ Re −3/4 for the ratio of the Kolmogorov microscale η to the integral length scale L.",

We use incomplete lower-upper decomposition (ILU) as an effective preconditioner for such systems and show the significant gain in efficiency when an incomplete LU of the full Jacobian is used instead of using only the Stokes operator. The computational cost, in terms of CPU time, grows with the size of the system (i.e., spatial resolution) according to a power law with exponent around 1.7, which is very modest compared to direct methods, indicating the appropriateness of the schemes for large nonlinear partial differential equation problems.",

The implicit method developed here employs a dual-time, preconditioned, three-dimensional algorithm, with multi-block and parallel execution capabilities. Time-derivative preconditioning is employed to ensure well-conditioned eigenvalues, which is important for the computational efficiency of the method. Special care is taken to ensure that the resulting eigensystem is independent of the density ratio and the local volume fraction, which renders the scheme well-suited to high density ratio, phase-separated two-fluid flows characteristic of many cavitating and boiling systems.

This problem contains the stochastic dynamics of 2D Navier-Stokes equation as a special case. We consider the limit of weak forces and dissipation, when there is a time scale separation between the inertial time scale (fast) and the spin-up or spin-down time (large) needed to reach an average energy balance. In this limit, we show that an adiabatic reduction (or stochastic averaging) of the dynamics can be performed. We then obtain a kinetic equation that describes the slow evolution of zonal jets over a very long time scale, where the effect of non-zonal turbulence has been integrated out. The main theoretical difficulty, achieved in this work, is to analyze the stationary distribution of a Lyapunov equation that describes quasi-Gaussian fluctuations around each zonal jet, in the inertial limit. This is necessary to prove that there is no ultraviolet divergence at leading order in such a way that the asymptotic expansion is self-consistent. We obtain at leading order a Fokker--Planck equation, associated to a stochastic kinetic equation, that describes the slow jet dynamics. Its deterministic part is related to well known phenomenological theories (for instance Stochastic Structural Stability Theory) and to quasi-linear approximations, whereas the stochastic part allows to go beyond the computation of the most probable zonal jet. We argue that the effect of the stochastic part may be of huge importance when, as for instance in the proximity of phase transitions, more than one attractor of the dynamics is present.",

It is known that extra terms due to the noncommutivity between the hybrid filter and the spatial derivative appear in the hybrid-filtered equations. In this paper the filtered Navier–Stokes equation is investigated using direct numerical simulation data of turbulent channel flow. In particular, the transport equations for the resolved and modeled energies are evaluated to examine the contribution of the extra terms. The RANS and LES regions are located by setting the width of the hybrid filter varying from the grid spacing to the channel half width. In the first case the RANS region is located near the wall for wall modeling in LES. In the second case the RANS and LES regions are located upstream and downstream, respectively. The extra terms in the Navier–Stokes and continuity equations show fairly large values in the RANS/LES interface region in both cases. The extra terms for the convection and the turbulent diffusion represent the energy transfer from the modeled part to the resolved part. This energy transfer suggests that conventional hybrid simulations neglecting the extra terms may underpredict velocity fluctuations in the interface region, causing an insufficient momentum transport and velocity mismatch in channel flow. These results show that the effect of the extra terms should be taken into account in the filtered Navier–Stokes equation as well as in the turbulent-energy equation in hybrid simulations.",

The methods combine the good features of stabilized methods already proposed for the Stokes flow and for advective-diffusive flows. These methods also generalize previous works restricted to low-order interpolations, thus allowing any combination of velocity and continuous pressure interpolations. A careful design of the stability parameters is suggested which considerably simplifies these generalizations. ?? 1992.",

We compare the simulation results against the predictions of classical Navier-Stokes theory for two different channel widths. For a channel width of 5.1 molecular diameters, we find that the velocity profile deviates significantly from the hydrodynamic prediction. The shape of this velocity profile is found to be independent of the applied field (pressure gradient). We find that the heat flux profile does not agree with the cubic profile predicted by Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, but shows significant oscillations located about one molecular diameter from the walls. This result differs from the earlier work of Todd and Evans [B. D. Todd and D. J. Evans, J. Chem.

An important peculiarity of the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations is the necessity to use the full continuity equation even for a binary mixture of two incompressible liquids due to dependence of mixture density on concentration. The quasicompressibility of the governing equations brings a short time-scale (quasiacoustic) process that may not affect the slow dynamics but may significantly complicate the numerical treatment. Using the multiple-scale method we separate the physical processes occurring on different time scales and, ultimately, derive the equations with the filtered-out quasiacoustics. The derived equations represent the Boussinesq approximation of the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations. This approximation can be further employed as a universal theoretical model for an analysis of slow thermodynamic and hydrodynamic evolution of the multiphase systems with strongly evolving and diffusing interfacial boundaries, i.e., for the processes involving dissolution/nucleation, evaporation/condensation, solidification/melting, polymerization, etc.",

The existence of a global stream function satisfying a perturbative form of the two-dimensionalNavier–Stokes equations for low Reynolds number is established. This stream function satisfies the appropriate boundary conditions on both the cylinder and at infinity, but nevertheless agrees with Stokes’ original results at finite ra- dius as the Reynolds number tends to zero. The Navier–Stokes equations are satisfied to a power-log power of the Reynolds number. The drag on the cylinder is calculated from first principles and the free parameter of the approach can be chosen to give good agreement with data on drag. In this revised working paper we put our approach on a firmer mathematical basis using the Helmholtz-Laplace equation as a linear approximation to the Navier–Stokes system.

We introduce a continuous mapping between a fixed reference configuration and the time-varying domain. By writing the Navier-Stokes equations as a conservation law for the independent variables in the reference configuration, the complexity introduced by variable geometry is reduced to solving a transformed conservation law in a fixed reference configuration. The spatial discretization is carried out using the Discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured meshes of triangles, while the time integration is performed using an explicit Runge-Kutta method. For general domain changes, the standard scheme fails to preserve exactly the free-stream solution which leads to some accuracy degradation, especially for low order approximations. This situation is remedied by adding an additional equation for the time evolution of the transformation Jacobian to the original conservation law and correcting for the accumulated metric integration errors. A number of results are shown to illustrate the flexibility of the approach to handle high-order approximations on complex geometries. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The new scheme is based on the recently introduced accelerated FC method, which enables use of highly accurate Fourier expansions as the main building block of general-domain PDE solvers. Previous FC-based PDE solvers are restricted to linear scalar equations with constant coefficients. The FC methodology presented in this text thus constitutes a significant generalization of the previous FC schemes, as it yields general-domain FC solvers for nonlinear systems of PDEs. While not restricted to periodic boundary conditions and therefore applicable to general boundary value problems on arbitrary domains, the proposed algorithm inherits many of the highly desirable properties arising from rapidly convergent Fourier expansions, including high-order convergence, essentially spectrally accurate dispersion relations, and much milder CFL constraints than those imposed by polynomial-based spectral methods-since, for example, the spectral radius of the FC first derivative grows linearly with the number of spatial discretization points. We demonstrate the accuracy and optimal parallel efficiency of the algorithm in a variety of scientific and engineering contexts relevant to fluid-dynamics and nonlinear acoustics. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "Computer simulation of the flow field in crossflow membrane filtration in a porous tube and shell system depends on the imposition of permeable wall conditions on the surface of the inner tube. Porous wall conditions are often represented by the Darcy equation which relates the pressure gradients within a flow stream to the flow rates through the permeable walls of the flow domain. In crossflow filtration the feed stream which flows tangentially to the porous tube surface is modelled by the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations represent viscous laminar Newtonian flow. They can also be generalised to deal with non-elastic, non-Newtonian fluids. The existence of viscous stress terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, which are expressed in terms of second-order partial derivatives, makes the straightforward linking of these equations to the Darcy equation in a numerical solution scheme impossible. Therefore, in order to develop a fluid dynamical model for crossflow filtration, special techniques which resolve this difficulty must be used. In this paper first, various methods of linking the Navier-Stokes and the Darcy equations in a solution scheme are considered and the strength and weaknesses of these methods are discussed. Following this discussion the details of a novel method which is used to develop a robust, accurate and cost-effective finite-element simulation scheme for the combined Navier-Stokes/Darcy flows in crossflow filtration is presented.",

          "abstract": "Phase-field models provide a way to model fluid interfaces as having finite thickness. This can allow the computation of interface movement and deformation on fixed grids. This paper applies phase-field modeling to the computation of two-phase incompressible Navier–Stokes flows. The Navier–Stokes equations are modified by the addition of the continuum forcing −C∇→φ, where C is the composition variable and φ is C&#039;s chemical potential. The equation for interface advection is replaced by a continuum advective-diffusion equation, with diffusion driven by C&#039;s chemical potential gradients. The paper discusses how solutions to these equations approach those of the original sharp-interface Navier–Stokes equations as the interface thickness ϵ and the diffusivity both go to zero. The basic flow-physics of phase-field interfaces is discussed. Straining flows can thin or thicken an interface and this must be resisted by a high enough diffusion. On the other hand, too large a diffusion will overly damp the flow. These two constraints result in an upper bound for the diffusivity of O(ϵ) and a lower bound of O(ϵ2). Within these two bounds, the phase-field Navier–Stokes equations appear to generate an O(ϵ) error relative to the exact sharp-interface equations. An O(h2/ϵ2) numerical method is introduced that is energy conserving in the sense that creation of interface energy by convection is always balanced by an equal decrease in kinetic energy caused by surface tension forcing. An O(h4/ϵ4) compact scheme is introduced that takes advantage of the asymptotic, comparatively smooth, behavior of the chemical potential. For O(ϵ) accurate phase-field models the optimum path to convergence for this scheme appears to be ϵ∝h4/5. The asymptotic rate of convergence corresponding to this is O(h4/5) but results at practical resolutions show that the practical convergence of the method is generally considerably faster than linear. Extensive analysis and computations show that this scheme is very effective and accurate. It allows the accurate calculation of two-phase flows with interfaces only two cells wide. Computational results are given for linear capillary waves and for Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. The first set of computations is compared to exact solutions of the diffuse-interface equations and of the original sharp-interface equations. The Rayleigh–Taylor computations test the ability of the method to compute highly deforming flows. These flows include near-singular phenomena such as interface coalescences and breakups, contact line movement, and the formation and breakup of thin wall-films. Grid-refinement studies are made and rapid convergence is found for macroscopic flow features such as instability growth rate and propagation speed, wavelength, and the general physical characteristics of the instability and mass transfer rates.",

Since the hydrodynamic operator is nonlinear, the functional integral yielding the statistics of fluctuations can be practically computed by linearizing around a physical solution of the hydrodynamic equation. We show that this procedure yields the dimensional scaling predicted by K41 theory at the lowest perturbative order, where the perturbation parameter is the inverse Reynolds number. Moreover, an explicit expression of the prefactor of the scaling law is obtained.",

A general class of time-stepping schemes is analyzed in this context, showing the non-linear unconditional stability and long-term dissipativity of particular members of this family of algorithms. In particular, algorithms showing these strong properties which additionally involve the solution of a linear problem at each time step are identified. A particular linear algorithm is shown to exhibit optimal long-term dissipative properties and to possess an algorithmic global attractor. These abstract results apply rigorously to Galerkin mixed finite element discretizations of the problem.

This study is focused on the dynamical part of UCPs. The main objective is twofold: first, computing important UCP input parameters (turbulent length scales and the sectional drag coefficient) by means of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of turbulent flow; and second, comparing UCP variables with spatially-averaged properties obtained from RANS simulations for the same configurations. The results show the importance of using a suitable parameterization of the drag force for different packing densities. An urban canopy parameterization that is a compromise between simplicity and accuracy is proposed. This scheme accounts for the variation of drag coefficients with packing densities, and has a parameterization of turbulent length scales. The technique adopted ensures that, at least for the simple configurations studied, the urban canopy parameterization gives values of spatially-averaged variables similar to those computed from a more complex simulation, such as RANS that resolves explicitly the flow around buildings.",

Fernàndez, Continuous interior penalty finite element method for the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations: space discretization and convergence. Numer. Math. (2007)] to flows at high Reynolds number. As a possible measure of solution quality we propose to monitor the ratio between the artificial dissipation induced by the numerical method and the computed physical dissipation. For smooth flows we prove that for our method the artificial dissipation serves as an a posteriori error estimator and also that it vanishes at an optimal rate. In the case of flows with multiscale features, we discuss a heuristic approach relating the decay of the artificial dissipation to the decay rate of the power spectrum. Some numerical results in two space dimensions are presented examining the relation between the numerical dissipation and solution quality. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The proposed methodology is based on a streamfunction-velocity formulation of the two-dimensional steady-state Navier-Stokes equations representing incompressible fluid flows in two-dimensional domains. Similar formulations are also possible for three-dimensional fluid flows. The main advantage of our formulation is that it avoids the difficulties associated with the computation of vorticity values, especially on solid boundaries, encountered when solving the streamfunction-vorticity formulations. Our formulation also avoids the difficulties associated with solving pressure equations of the conventional velocity-pressure formulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. We describe the new formulation of the Navier-Stokes equatio ns and use this formulation to solve a couple of fluid flow problems. We use a biconjugate gradient method to obtain the numerical solutions of the fluid flow problems and provide detailed comparison data for the lid driven cavity flow problem. It is discovered that our new formulation successfully provides high accuracy solutions for the benchmark problem. In addition, we also solve a problem of flow in a rectangular cavity with aspect ratio 2 and compare our results qualitatively and quantitatively with numerical and experimental results available in the literature. In all cases, we obtain high accuracy solutions with little additional cost. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In particular, we show that if one has global well-posedness in $H^1$ for the periodic Navier-Stokes problem with a forcing term, then one can obtain global regularity both for periodic and for Schwartz initial data (thus yielding a positive answer to both official formulations of the problem for the Clay Millennium Prize), and can also obtain global smooth solutions from smooth $H^1$ data, and global almost smooth solutions from smooth finite energy data.

The newly introduced schemes are validated and tested in terms of accuracy and convergence rate on a series of one- and two-dimensional test cases.

A nonlocal variant consists of the Navier-Stokes equations suitably coupled with a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation. The authors, jointly with P. Colli, have already proven the existence of a global weak solution to a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system subject to no-slip and no-flux boundary conditions. Uniqueness is still an open issue even in dimension two. However, in this case, the energy identity holds. This property is exploited here to define, following J.M. Ball&#039;s approach, a generalized semiflow which has a global attractor. Through a similar argument, we can also show the existence of a (connected) global attractor for the convective nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with a given velocity field, even in dimension three. Finally, we demonstrate that any weak solution fulfilling the energy inequality also satisfies an energy inequality. This allows us to establish the existence of the trajectory attractor also in dimension three with a time dependent external force.",

While Borel summation does not apply for non-analytic initial data, the present approach generates an integral equation (IE) applicable to much more general data. We apply these concepts to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes (NS) system and show how the IE approach can give rise to local existence proofs. In this approach, the global existence problem in three-dimensional NS systems, for specific initial condition and viscosity, becomes a problem of asymptotics in the variable p (dual to 1/t or some positive power of 1/t). Furthermore, the errors in numerical computations in the associated IE can be controlled rigorously, which is very important for nonlinear PDEs such as NS when solutions are not known to exist globally.Moreover, computation of the solution of the IE over an interval [0,p0] provides sharper control of its p--&gt;infinity behaviour. Preliminary numerical computations give encouraging results.",

It is shown that, at least up to and including fourth order, the velocity attains the classical order of accuracy without further constraints. However, in case of a time-dependent gradient operator, which can appear in case of time-varying meshes, additional order conditions need to be satisfied to ensure the correct order of accuracy. Furthermore, the pressure is only first-order accurate unless additional order conditions are satisfied. Two new methods that lead to a second-order accurate pressure are proposed, which are applicable to a certain class of three- and four-stage methods. A special case appears when the boundary conditions for the continuity equation are independent of time, since in that case the pressure can be computed to the same accuracy as the velocity field, without additional cost. Relevant computations of decaying vortices and of an actuator disk in a time-dependent inflow support the analysis and the proposed methods. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

The RDG method, originally developed for the compressible Euler equations, is extended to discretize viscous and heat fluxes in the Navier-Stokes equations using a so-called inter-cell reconstruction, where a smooth solution is locally reconstructed using a least-squares method from the underlying discontinuous DG solution. Similar to the recovery-based DG (rDG) methods, this reconstructed DG method eliminates the introduction of ad hoc penalty or coupling terms commonly found in traditional DG methods. Unlike rDG methods, this RDG method does not need to judiciously choose a proper form of a recovered polynomial, thus is simple, flexible, and robust, and can be used on arbitrary grids. The developed RDG method is used to compute a variety of flow problems on arbitrary meshes to demonstrate its accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and versatility. The numerical results indicate that this RDG method is able to deliver the same accuracy as the well-known Bassi-Rebay II scheme, at a half of its computing costs for the discretization of the viscous fluxes in the Navier-Stokes equations, clearly demonstrating its superior performance over the existing DG methods for solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

We study three different forms of the governing equations using seven test cases. Three test cases involve flow over mountains which require the implementation of non-reflecting boundary conditions, while one test requires viscous terms (density current). Including viscous stresses into finite difference, finite element, or spectral element models poses no additional challenges; however, including these terms to either finite volume or discontinuous Galerkin models requires the introduction of additional machinery because these methods were originally designed for first-order operators. We use the local discontinuous Galerkin method to overcome this obstacle. The seven test cases show that all of our models yield good results. The main conclusion is that equation set 1 (non-conservation form) does not perform as well as sets 2 and 3 (conservation forms). For the density current (viscous), the SE and DG models using set 3 (mass and total energy) give less dissipative results than the other equation sets; based on these results we recommend set 3 for the development of future multiscale research codes. In addition, the fact that set 3 conserves both mass and energy up to machine precision motives us to pursue this equation set for the development of future mesoscale models. For the bubble and mountain tests, the DG models performed better. Based on these results and due to its conservation properties we recommend the DG method. In the worst case scenario, the DG models are 50% slower than the non-conservative SE models. In the best case scenario, the DG models are just as efficient as the conservative SE models.",

It extends previous work on optimization for inviscid flow. The theory is applied to a system defined by the partial differential equations of the flow, with the boundary shape acting as the control. The Fr echet derivative of the cost function is determined via the solution of an adjoint partial differential equation, and the boundary shape is then modified in a direction of descent. This process is repeated until an optimum solution is approached. Each design cycle requires the numerical solution of both the flow and the adjoint equations, leading to a computational cost roughly equal to the cost of two flow solutions. The cost is kept low by using multigrid techniques, in conjunction with preconditioning to accelerate the convergence of the solutions. The power of the method is illustrated by designs of wings and wingbody combinations for long range transport aircraft. Satisfactory designs are usually obtained with 2040 design cycles.",

The implicit unfactored method combines Newton subiterations and point-by-point Gauss-Seidel subrelaxation. Implicit-coupled and -decoupled strategies are compared for their efficiency in the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in conjunction with low-Re two-equation turbulence models. Computations have been carried out for the flow over an axisymmetric bump using the k-ε and k-ω models. Comparisons have been obtained with experimental data and other numerical solutions. The present study reveals that the implicit unfactored implementation of the two-equation turbulence models reduces the computing time and improves the robustness of the CFD code in turbulent compressible flows.",

We demonstrate that dissipative particledynamics (DPD) simulations with similar pairwise particle-particle interactions can alsobe used to simulate the dynamics of multiphase fluids.

The macroscopic secondary momentum balance equation is in the form of a wave equation that propagates the deviation from the intensive momentum while concurrently, in the case of a Newtonian fluid and under certain assumptions, the macroscopic dominant momentum balance equation may be approximated by Darcy&#039;s equation to address drag dominant flow. We then develop extensions to the dominant macroscopic Navier-Stokes (NS) equation for saturated porous matrices, to account for the pressure gradient at the microscopic solid-fluid interfaces. At the microscopic interfaces we introduce the exchange of inertia between the phases, accounting for the relative fluid square velocities and the rate of these velocities, interpreted as Forchheimer terms. Conditions are provided to approximate the extended dominant NS equation by Forchheimer quadratic momentum law or by Darcy&#039;s linear momentum law. We also show that the dominant NS equation can conform into a nonlinear wave equation. The one-dimensional numerical solution of this nonlinear wave equation demonstrates good qualitative agreement with experiments for the case of a highly deformable elasto-plastic matrix.

The method is intended for simulating internal flows containing complex, moving immersed boundaries such as those encountered in several cardiovascular applications. The background domain (e.g. the empty aorta) is discretized efficiently with a curvilinear boundary-fitted mesh while the complex moving immersed boundary (say a prosthetic heart valve) is treated with the sharp-interface, hybrid Cartesian/immersed-boundary approach of Gilmanov and Sotiropoulos [A. Gilmanov, F. Sotiropoulos, A hybrid cartesian/immersed boundary method for simulating flows with 3d, geometrically complex, moving bodies, Journal of Computational Physics 207 (2005) 457-492.]. To facilitate the implementation of this novel modeling paradigm in complex flow simulations, an accurate and efficient numerical method is developed for solving the unsteady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in generalized curvilinear coordinates. The method employs a novel, fully-curvilinear staggered grid discretization approach, which does not require either the explicit evaluation of the Christoffel symbols or the discretization of all three momentum equations at cell interfaces as done in previous formulations. The equations are integrated in time using an efficient, second-order accurate fractional step methodology coupled with a Jacobian-free, Newton-Krylov solver for the momentum equations and a GMRES solver enhanced with multigrid as preconditioner for the Poisson equation. Several numerical experiments are carried out on fine computational meshes to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for standard benchmark problems as well as for unsteady, pulsatile flow through a curved, pipe bend. To demonstrate the ability of the method to simulate flows with complex, moving immersed boundaries we apply it to calculate pulsatile, physiological flow through a mechanical, bileaflet heart valve mounted in a model straight aorta with an anatomical-like triple sinus. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Instead of introducing a Lagrange&#039;s multiplier to enforce the vesicle inextensibility constraint, we modify the model by adopting a spring-like tension to make the vesicle boundary nearly inextensible so that solving for the unknown tension can be avoided. We also derive a new elastic force from the modified vesicle energy and obtain exactly the same form as the originally unmodified one. In order to represent the vesicle boundary, we use Fourier spectral approximation so we can compute the geometrical quantities on the interface more accurately. A series of numerical tests on the present scheme have been conducted to illustrate the applicability and reliability of the method. We first perform the accuracy check of the geometrical quantities of the interface, and the convergence check for different stiffness numbers as well as fluid variables. Then we study the vesicle dynamics in quiescent flow and in gravity. Finally, the shapes of vesicles in Poiseuille flow are investigated in detail to study the effects of the reduced volume, the confinement, and the mean flow velocity. The numerical results are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained in literature. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "Surface-tension-driven flows and, in particular, their tendency to decay spontaneously into drops have Fachbereich Germany long fascinated naturalists, the earliest systematic experiments dating back to the beginning of the 19th century. Linear stability theory governs the onset of breakup and was developed by Rayleigh, Plateau, and Maxwell. However, only recently has attention turned to the nonlinear behavior in the vicinity of the singular point where a drop separates. The increased attention is due to a number of recent and increasingly refined experiments, as well as to a host of technological applications, ranging from printing to mixing and fiber spinning. The description of drop separation becomes possible because jet motion turns out to be effectively governed by one-dimensional equations, which still contain most of the richness of the original dynamics. In addition, an attraction for physicists lies in the fact that the separation singularity is governed by universal scaling laws, which constitute an asymptotic solution of the Navier-Stokes equation before and after breakup. The Navier-Stokes equation is thus continued uniquely through the singularity. At high viscosities, a series of noise-driven instabilities has been observed, which are a nested superposition of singularities of the same universal form. At low viscosities, there is rich scaling behavior in addition to aesthetically pleasing breakup patterns driven by capillary waves. The author reviews the theoretical development of this field alongside recent experimental work, and outlines unsolved problems",

In essence, the Lagrangian solid mesh, which represents the immersed deformable cells, is set to move on top of a background Eulerian mesh.

The de-aggregation of a RBC cluster at dierent shear rates is also investigated to pro- vide an explanation of the shear-rate-dependence of the blood viscoelastic properties.

To solve the Navier-Stokes equations, an approach that can be conceived as a fractional step method is used.

To date, these simulations have been built on discretized velocity models of up to 27 neighbors. Recent work has shown that higher order approximations of the continuum Boltzmann equation enable not only recovery of the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, but also simulations for a wider range of Knudsen numbers, which is especially important in micro- and nanoscale flows. These higher-order models have significant impact on both the communication and computational complexity of the application. We present a performance study of the higher-order models as compared to the traditional ones, on both the IBM Blue Gene/P and Blue Gene/Q architectures. We study the tradeoffs of many optimizations methods such as the use of deep halo level ghost cells that, alongside hybrid programming models, reduce the impact of extended models and enable efficient modeling of extreme regimes of computational fluid dynamics.",

The two main tools of our analysis are the asymptotic strong Feller property, introduced in this work, and an approximate integration by parts formula.

          "abstract": "Recent interest in the development of a unifying framework among direct numerical simulations, large-eddy simulations, and statistically averaged formulations of the Navier–Stokes equations, provides the motivation for the present paper. Toward that goal, the properties of the residual (subgrid-scale) stress of the temporally filtered Navier–Stokes equations are carefully examined. This includes the frame-invariance properties of the filtered equations and the resulting residual stress. Causal time-domain filters, parametrized by a temporal filter width $0&lt;\Delta&lt;\infty$, are considered. For several reasons, the differential forms of such filters are preferred to their corresponding integral forms; among these, storage requirements for differential forms are typically much less than for integral forms and, for some filters, are independent of $\Delta$. The behavior of the residual stress in the limits of both vanishing and infinite filter widths is examined. It is shown analytically that, in the limit $\Delta\rightarrow0$, the residual stress vanishes, in which case the Navier–Stokes equations are recovered from the temporally filtered equations. Alternately, in the limit $\Delta\rightarrow\infty$, the residual stress is equivalent to the long-time averaged stress, and the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are recovered from the temporally filtered equations. The predicted behavior at the asymptotic limits of filter width is further validated by numerical simulations of the temporally filtered forced, viscous Burger’s equation. Finally, finite filter widths are also considered, and both a priori and a posteriori analyses of temporal similarity and temporal approximate deconvolution models of the residual stress are conducted for the model problem.",

Toward this aim, the instantaneous and mean dynamics of the Lamb vector divergence are examined in several analytic and turbulent flow examples relative to its capacity to identify and characterize spatially localized motions having a distinct capacity to effect a time rate of change of momentum. In this context, the transport equation for the Lamb vector divergence is developed and shown to accurately describe the dynamical mechanisms by which adjacent high- and low-momentum fluid parcels interact to effect a time rate of change of momentum and generate forces such as drag. From this, a transport-equation-based framework is developed that captures the self-sustaining spatiotemporal interactions between coherent motions, e.g. ejections and sweeps in turbulent wall flows, as predicted by the binary source–sink distribution of the Lamb vector divergence. New insight into coherent motion development and evolution is found through the analysis of the Lamb vector divergence.",

In this research, we introduce a new modelling technique that couples Navier–Stokes equations with protein molecular dynamics to investigate the behaviours of RBC aggregates and their effects on the blood rheology. In essence, the Lagrangian solid mesh, which represents the immersed deformable cells, is set to move on top of a background Eulerian mesh. The effects of cell–cell interaction (adhesive/repulsive) and hydrodynamic forces on RBC aggregates are studied by introducing equivalent protein molecular potentials into the immersed finite element method. The aggregation of red blood cells in quiescent fluids is simulated. The de-aggregation of a RBC cluster at different shear rates is also investigated to provide an explanation of the shear-rate-dependence of the blood viscoelastic properties. Finally, the influences of cell–cell interaction, RBC rigidity, and vessel geometry are addressed in a series of test cases with deformable cells (normal and sickle RBCs) passing through micro- and capillary vessels.",

The equation for kinetic energy is derived from the momentum equation; it is therefore a consequence of the discretized momentum balance rather than a separate equation. For this reason, the conservation of kinetic energy is commonly referred to as secondary conservation, in contrast to the primary conservation of mass and momentum. When solving the Navier–Stokes equations numerically, there are several reasons to discretely mimic the exact conservation properties of these three quantities. First, since the kinetic energy is a norm of the solution, a method that conserves this property is guaranteed to be stable. Secondly, it is well known that absence of artificial dissipation leads to vastly improved accuracy in large eddy simulations (LES).",

          "abstract": "The partial differential equation describing unsteady velocity profile of electroosmotic flow (EOF) in a cylindrical capillary filled with a nonconstant viscosity electrolyte was derived. Analytical solution, based on the general Navier-Stokes equation, was found for constant viscosity electrolytes using the separation of variables (Fourier method). For the case of a nonconstant viscosity electrolyte, the steady-state velocity profile was calculated assuming that the viscosity decreases exponentially in the direction from the wall to the capillary center. Since the respective equations with nonconstant viscosity term are not solvable in general, the method of continuous binding conditions was used to solve this problem. In this method, an arbitrary viscosity profile can be modeled. The theoretical conclusions show that the relaxation times at which an EOF approaches the steady state are too short to have an impact on a separation process in any real systems. A viscous layer at the wall affects EOF significantly, if it is thicker than the Debye length of the electric double layer. The presented description of the EOF dynamics is applicable to any microfluidic systems.",

The dominant forcing functions are found as solutions of a Lyapunov equation and the response functions are found as the distinct solutions of a related Lyapunov equation. Neither the forcing nor the response functions can be identified with the normal modes of the linearized dynamical operator. High variance levels are sustained in these systems under stochastic forcing, largely by transfer of energy from the mean flow to the perturbation field, despite the exponential stability of all normal modes of the system. From the perspective of modal analysis the explanation for this amplification of variance can be traced to the non-normality of the linearized dynamical operator. The great amplification of perturbation variance found for Couette and Poiseuille flow implies a mechanism for producing and sustaining high levels of variance in shear flows from relatively small intrinsic or extrinsic forcing disturbances (22 Refs.)",

We numerically demonstrate convergence of the BGK schemes to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and quantify the errors associated with compressibility and discretization effects. When compressibility error is smaller than discretization error, convergence in both grid spacing and time step is shown to be second-order for the LB method and is confirmed to be fourth-order for the fourth-order BGK solver. However, when the compressibility error is simultaneously reduced as the grid is refined, the LB method behaves as a first-order scheme in time. ?? 1995.",

          "abstract": "Quasi-stationary, or metastable, states play an important role in two-dimensional turbulent fluid flows where they often emerge on time-scales much shorter than the viscous time scale, and then dominate the dynamics for very long time intervals. In this paper we give a dynamical systems explanation of the metastability of an explicit family of solutions, referred to as bar states, of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on the torus. These states are physically relevant because they are associated with certain maximum entropy solutions of the Euler equations, and they have been observed as one type of metastable state in numerical studies of two-dimensional turbulence. For small viscosity (high Reynolds number), these states are quasi-stationary in the sense that they decay on the slow, viscous timescale. Linearization about these states leads to a time-dependent operator. Using the so-called hypocoercive properties of the linearized operator, it is shown that there is an invariant subspace on which this operator produces decay at a rate much faster than the viscous convergence rate. Thus, we provide rigorous justification in this context for the existence of multiple time-scales in the evolution of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on the torus and for the role that stationary solutions of the Euler equations play in serving as metastable states.",

          "abstract": "The effects of non-normality and nonlinearity of the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes differential operator on the dynamics of a large laminar separation bubble over a flat plate have been studied in both subcritical and slightly supercritical conditions. The global eigenvalue analysis and direct numerical simulations have been employed in order to investigate the linear and nonlinear stability of the flow. The steady-state solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations at supercritical and slightly subcritical Reynolds numbers have been computed by means of a continuation procedure. Topological flow changes on the base flow have been found to occur close to transition, supporting the hypothesis of some authors that unsteadiness of separated flows could be due to structural changes within the bubble. The global eigenvalue analysis and numerical simulations initialized with small amplitude perturbations have shown that the non-normality of convective modes allows the bubble to act as a strong amplifier of small disturbances. For subcritical conditions, nonlinear effects have been found to induce saturation of such an amplification, originating a wave-packet cycle similar to the one established in supercritical conditions, but which is eventually damped. A transient amplification of finite amplitude perturbations has been observed even in the attached region due to the high sensitivity of the flow to external forcing, as assessed by a linear sensitivity analysis. For supercritical conditions, the non-normality of the modes has been found to generate low-frequency oscillations (flapping) at large times. The dependence of such frequencies on the Reynolds number has been investigated and a scaling law based on a physical interpretation of the phenomenon has been provided, which is able to explain the onset of a secondary flapping frequency close to transition.",

Iterative defect correction is introduced for circumventing the difficulty in solving Navier-Stokes equations discretized with a second- or higher-order accurate convective part. By Fourier analysis applied to a model equation, an optimal choice is made for the operator to be inverted in the defect correction iteration. As a smoothing technique for the multigrid method, collective symmetric point Gauss-Seidel relaxation is applied with as the basic solution technique: exact Newton iteration applied to a continuously differentiable, first-order upwind discretization of the full Navier-Stokes equations. For non-smooth flow problems, the convergence results obtained are already competitive with those of well-established Navier-Stokes methods. For smooth flow problems, the present method performs better than any standard method. Here, first-order discretization error accuracy is attained in a single multigrid cycle, and second-order accuracy in only one defect correction cycle. The method contributes to the state of the art in efficiently computing compressible viscous flows. ?? 1990.",

We extend a discontinuous finite element discretization originally considered for hyperbolic systems such as the Euler equations to the case of the Navier–Stokes equations by treating the viscous terms with a mixed formulation. The method combines two key ideas which are at the basis of the finite volume and of the finite element method, the physics of wave propagation being accounted for by means of Riemann problems and accuracy being obtained by means of high-order polynomial approximations within elements. As a consequence the method is ideally suited to compute high-order accurate solution of the Navier–Stokes equations on unstructured grids. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by computing the compressible viscous flow on a flat plate and around a NACA0012 airfoil for several flow regimes using constant, linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.",

Previously [1], it has been shown that one dimensional Burgers equation is reduced to a low dimensional model by this method, which is employed to solve boundary optimal control problems very efficiently. The present paper demonstrates that the Karhunen-Loeve Galerkin procedure can be extended to solve problems of the boundary optimal control of multidimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Since the reduction of modes in the multidimensional case is much larger than that in the one dimensional case, the present technique is found to be more powerful when applied to the control problems of the Navier-Stokes equation than those of the Burgers equation.

Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is used to solve the resulting Navier-Stokes equations. We present solutions for two- and three-dimensional flows subject to various forms of the Robin boundary condition in domains bounded by flat and curved boundaries.

In this research, we introduce a new modelling technique that couples Navier-Stokes equations with protein molecular dynamics to investigate the behaviours of RBC aggregates and their effects on the blood rheology. In essence, the Lagrangian solid mesh, which represents the immersed deformable cells, is set to move on top of a background Eulerian mesh. The effects of cell-cell interaction (adhesive/repulsive) and hydrodynamic forces on RBC aggregates are studied by introducing equivalent protein molecular potentials into the immersed finite element method. The aggregation of red blood cells in quiescent fluids is simulated. The de-aggregation of a RBC cluster at different shear rates is also investigated to provide an explanation of the shear-rate-dependence of the blood viscoelastic properties. Finally, the influences of cell-cell interaction, RBC rigidity, and vessel geometry are addressed in a series of test cases with deformable cells (normal and sickle RBCs) passing through micro- and capillary vessels.

Such equations must be coupled through physically significant continuity conditions at the interface separating the two subdomains. To avoid the difficulties of this heterogeneous approach, a widely used strategy is to consider the Navier-Stokes equations in the whole domain and to correct them introducing suitable terms that mimic the presence of the porous medium. In this paper we discuss these two different methodologies and we compare them numerically on a sample test case after proposing an iterative algorithm to solve a Navier-Stokes/Forchheimer problem. Finally, we apply these strategies to a problem of internal ventilation of motorbike helmets. ?? 2013 IMACS.",

In this paper, the multiscale interactions are captured by exact expressions evaluated at a single scale of the Mexican hat wavelet coefficients: the larger-scale terms as a volume integral of nearby wavelet coefficients, and the smaller-scale contributions as iterated Laplacians of the coefficient at the point of interest. As a result, the Navier-Stokes equations are expressed exactly at a single scale. This facilitates the evaluation of the dominant H??lder exponent near singularities. From the scaling properties of wavelet coefficients, it is shown that Euler dynamics would generate stronger singularities for any h &lt; 1, but that viscous dynamics would not unless h &lt; -1 (a discontinuous case). We discuss how this conclusion could be affected by boundary conditions. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Direct numerical simulation of a coagulating aerosol in a two-dimensional, incompressible, iso-thermal shear layer is performed. The evolution of the particle field is obtained by utilizing a nodal model to approximate the aerosol general dynamic equation (GDE). The GDE is written in discrete form as a population balance on each particle size and describes particle dynamics under the influence of various physical phenomena: convection, diffusion, and coagulation. The nodal approach is advantageous in that there are no a priori assumptions regarding the nature of the particle size distribution and therefore does not suffer from the severe constraints of other methodologies. This approach divides the particle size distribution into &quot;bins,&quot; for each of which a transport equation is obtained. A coagulation Damk??hler number is defined to represent the ratio of the convective time scale to the coagulation time scale. Simulations are performed at a Reynolds number of 200 and coagulation Damk??hler numbers of 1 and 10. The nanoparticle field is presented as a function of space, time and size. Results indicate that strong spatial variations in the particle concentrations develop in time and that these spatial gradients act to increase the geometric standard deviation of the particle size distribution. As the coagulation Damk??hler number is increased, particle growth increases and particle size distributions wider than the self-preserving limit are predicted. The capture of the evolution of the particle field as a function of space, time and size suggests that the methodology is sufficiently general and robust to be useful in predicting the growth and dynamics in inhomogeneous, and possibly, turbulent flows. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Following van der Houwen and Wray, sixteen ERK pairs are presented using from two to five registers of memory per equation, per grid point and having accuracies from third- to fifth-order. Methods have been tested with not only DETEST, but also with the 1 D wave equation. Two of the methods have been applied to the DNS of a compressible jet as well as methane-air and hydrogen-air flames. Derived 3(2) and 4(3) pairs are competitive with existing full-storage methods.

In the model the two sets of equations are coupled through an extra phase induced stress term in the Navier--Stokes equations and a fluid induced transport term in the Cahn--Hilliard equation. Fully discrete mixed finite element methods are proposed for approximating the coupled system, it is shown that the proposed numerical methods satisfy a mass conservation law, and a discrete energy law which is analogous to the basic energy law for the phase field model. The convergence of the numerical solutions to the solutions of the phase field model and its sharp interface limit is established by utilizing the discrete energy law. As a by-product, the convergence result also provides a constructive proof of the existence of weak solutions to the Navier--Stokes-Cahn--Hilliard phase field model.

It is also often difficult and/or expensive to compute. While the pressure is perfectly well- defined (at least up to an arbitrary additive constant) by the governing equations describing the conservation of mass and momentum, it is (ironically) less so when more directly expressed in terms of a Poisson equation that is both derivable from the original conservation equations and used (or misused) to replace the mass conservation equation. This is because in this latter form it is also necessary to address directly the subject of pressure boundary conditions, whose proper specification is crucial (in many ways) and forms the basis of this work. Herein we show that the same principles of mass and momentum conservation, combined with a continuity argument, lead to the correct boundary conditions for the pressure Poisson equation: viz., a Neumann condition that is derived simply by applying the normal component of the momentum equation at the boundary. It usually follows, but is not so crucial, that the tangential momentum equation is also satisfied at the boundary. KEY",

In this paper, we propose a conserved wave absorption method based on the relaxation method. Instead of deciding the absorption coefficient empirically, the conserved absorption method dynamically determines the absorption coefficient by solving the mass conservation equation derived in this article. In order to validate the conserved absorption method, a 2-D numerical wave flume is established and a series of numerical tests are conducted. The numerical wave tank solves the Navier-Stokes equations and constructs free surface with a VOF (volume of fluid) scheme. In the first test, the conserved absorption is validated at the end of the channel by generating regular waves, 2-order and 5-order Stokes waves and solitary waves of various amplitudes and frequencies. In the second test, the conserved absorption is tested with reflected waves, by generating standing waves in a tank with a sponge layer adjacent to the wave-generating boundary and a vertical wall at the opposite end. The third test validates the conserved absorption with both incident waves and reflected waves, i.e., the sponge layers are at both ends of the tank. The fourth test investigates the conserved absorption with large-amplitude waves under a realistic sea scale. In these tests, measurements of real sea states (Mori et al., 2002) as well as theoretical and experimental results (Luth et al., 1994) are employed to make comparison against the simulated results. It is found that the conserved wave absorption is applicable to various waves, at both the head and the end of the wave channel. In addition, it can give acceptable results with a short absorption length.",

          "abstract": "Simulation of nano-scale channel flows using a coupled Navier-Stokes/Molecular Dynamics (MD) method is presented. The flow cases serve as examples of the application of a multi-physics computational framework put forward in this work. The framework employs a set of (partially) overlapping sub-domains in which different levels of physical modelling are used to describe the flow. This way, numerical simulations based on the Navier-Stokes equations can be extended to flows in which the continuum and/or Newtonian flow assumptions break down in regions of the domain, by locally increasing the level of detail in the model. Then, the use of multiple levels of physical modelling can reduce the overall computational cost for a given level of fidelity. The present work describes the structure of a parallel computational framework for such simulations, including details of a Navier-Stokes/MD coupling, the convergence behaviour of coupled simulations as well as the parallel implementation. For the cases considered here, micro-scale MD problems are constructed to provide viscous stresses for the Navier-Stokes equations. The first problem is the planar Poiseuille flow, for which the viscous fluxes on each cell face in the finite-volume discretization are evaluated using MD. The second example deals with fully developed three-dimensional channel flow, with molecular level modelling of the shear stresses in a group of cells in the domain corners. An important aspect in using shear stresses evaluated with MD in Navier-Stokes simulations is the scatter in the data due to the sampling of a finite ensemble over a limited interval. In the coupled simulations, this prevents the convergence of the system in terms of the reduction of the norm of the residual vector of the finite-volume discretization of the macro-domain. Solutions to this problem are discussed in the present work, along with an analysis of the effect of number of realizations and sample duration. The averaging of the apparent viscosity for each cell face, i.e. the ratio of the shear stress predicted from MD and the imposed velocity gradient, over a number of macro-scale time steps is shown to be a simple but effective method to reach a good level of convergence of the coupled system. Finally, the parallel efficiency of the developed method is demonstrated. © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Purpose - This paper aims to develop an efficient numerical method for simulating multicomponent flows by solving the system of conservative equations closed by a general two parameters equation of state. Design/methodology/ approach - A finite difference method for solving the two-dimensional Euler or Navier-Stokes equations for multicomponent flows in a general curvilinear coordinate system is developed. The system of conservative equations (mass, momentum and energy) is closed with a general two parameters equation of state (ρe=(p+γp)/(γ-1)), which, associated to a γ-formulation, allows easy computation of multicomponent flows. In order to enforce the stability of the numerical scheme, the Roe&#039;s flux-difference splitting is adopted for the numerical treatment of the inviscid fluxes. The method is adapted to treat also unsteady flows by implementing an explicit Euler scheme. Findings - The method was applied to compute various configurations of flows, ranging from incompressible to compressible fluid, including cases of single component flows or multicomponent ones. Computations show that the use of primitive variables instead of conservative ones, especially at low Mach numbers, improves the iteration process when the resolution is performed with a relaxation procedure such as Gauss-Seidel method. Simulations of compressible flows with a strong shock show the ability of the present method to capture shocks correctly even with the use of primitive variables. To complete numerical tests, flows involving two fluids with the presence of interactions between a shock and a discontinuity surface have been treated successfully. Also, a case of cavitating flow has been considered in this work. Originality/value - The present method permits the simulation of a large variety of multicomponent complexes flows with an efficient numerical taking advantage of Roe&#039;s flux-difference splitting in curvilinear coordinate system.

The new method removes the difficulty in specifying incident waves through an inflow boundary with the presence of strong wave reflection. Instead, only the open (radiation) boundary condition is needed in the simulation. By using different source functions, the writers are able to generate various wave trains, including the linear monochromatic wave, irregular wave, Stokes wave, solitary wave, and cnoidal wave. By comparing numerical results with analytical solutions, the writers have shown that the proposed method can accurately generate not only small amplitude waves but also nonlinear waves in both intermediate and shallow water.

All computations are performed as rotor-only computations, excluding the tower and nacelle. In this articlewecompare computed results and measurements in the form of shaft torque, flap and edge moments, aerodynamic coefficients and pressure distributions as a function of wind speed. The spanwise force distributions are comparedwithmeasurements for allwind speeds, along with the pressure distributions at five spanwise positions. Finally, we show how 3D CFD computations can be used to extract information about three-dimensional aerodynamic effects.",

The approach can be considered as an extension of the original reactive &quot;large elongated body theory&quot; of Lighthill to the 3-D self-propulsion to which a resistive empirical model has been added. While all the mathematical fundamentals have been detailed by Boyer et al. (http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/hebergement/Publications/2007/3721.pdf, 2007), this paper essentially focuses on the numerical validation and calibration of the model and the study of swimming gaits. The proposed model is coupled to an algorithm allowing us to compute the motion of the fish head and the field of internal control torque from the knowledge of the imposed internal strain fields. Based on the Newton-Euler formalism of robot dynamics, this algorithm works faster than real time. As far as precision is concerned, many tests obtained with several planar and 3-D gaits are reported and compared (in the planar case) with a Navier-Stokes solver, which, until today have been devoted to the planar swim. The comparisons obtained are very encouraging since in all the cases we tested, the differences between our simplified and reference simulations do not exceed 10%.",

Fluids 21, 082001 (2009); 10.1063/1.3177351 Navier–Stokes modeling of a Gaede pump stage in the viscous and transitional flow regimes using slip-flow boundary conditions In hypersonic flows about space vehicles in low earth orbits or flows in microchannels of microelectromechanical devices, the local Knudsen number lies in the continuum–transition regime. Navier–Stokes equations are not adequate to model these flows since they are based on small deviation from local thermodynamic equilibrium. To model these flows, a number of extended hydrodynamics or generalized hydrodynamics models have been proposed over the past fifty years, along with the direct simulation Monte Carlo ͑DSMC͒ approach. One of these models is the Burnett equations which are obtained from the Chapman–Enskog expansion of the Boltzmann equation ͓with Knudsen number ͑Kn͒ as a small parameter͔ to O(Kn 2). With the currently available computing power, it has been possible in recent years to numerically solve the Burnett equations. However, attempts at solving the Burnett equations have uncovered many physical and numerical difficulties with the Burnett model. As a result, several improvements to the conventional Burnett equations have been proposed in recent years to address both the physical and numerical issues; two of the most well known are the &#039;&#039;augmented Burnett equations&#039;&#039; and the &#039;&#039;BGK–Burnett equations.&#039;&#039; This paper traces the history of the Burnett model and describes some of the recent developments. The relationship between the Burnett equations and the Grad&#039;s 13 moment equations is elucidated by employing the Maxwell–Truesdell–Green iteration. Numerical solutions are provided to assess the accuracy and applicability of Burnett equations for modeling flows in the continuum–transition regime. The important issue of surface boundary conditions is addressed. Computations are compared with the available experimental data, Navier–Stokes calculations, Burnett solutions of other investigators, and DSMC solutions as much as possible.",

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust and efficient numerical method for the simulation of low Mach number flows in which the poorly distributed eigenvalues usually result in the numerical difficulties. The method takes advantage of the pressure-based and the density-based methods. It thus accelerates the numerical convergence by adjusting the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. In order to control the numerical instability and the spurious wave reflections at the numerical boundaries, a characteristic boundary condition is formulated. This numerical method as well as the boundary condition treatment extend the traditional fractional step method to the simulation of compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The performance and the accuracy of the method to calculate the flows with large amplitude of acoustic waves and strong heat transfer have been demonstrated by the direct numerical simulation of three distinct cases: a one-dimensional Euler equation with large amplitude of acoustic waves, an adiabatic turbulent boundary layer, and a turbulent boundary layer with heated wall. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "The foundation for the development of modern compressible flow solver is based on the Riemann solution of the inviscid Euler equations. The high-order schemes are basically related to high-order spatial interpolation or reconstruction. In order to overcome the low-order wave interaction mechanism due to the Riemann solution, the temporal accuracy of the scheme can be improved through the Runge-Kutta method, where the dynamic deficiencies in the first-order Riemann solution is alleviated through the sub-step spatial reconstruction in the Runge-Kutta process. The close coupling between the spatial and temporal evolution in the original nonlinear governing equations seems weakened due to its spatial and temporal decoupling. Many recently developed high-order methods require a Navier-Stokes flux function under piece-wise discontinuous high-order initial reconstruction. However, the piece-wise discontinuous initial data and the hyperbolic-parabolic nature of the Navier-Stokes equations seem inconsistent mathematically, such as the divergence of the viscous and heat conducting terms due to initial discontinuity. In this paper, based on the Boltzmann equation, we are going to present a time-dependent flux function from a high-order discontinuous reconstruction. The theoretical basis for such an approach is due to the fact that the Boltzmann equation has no specific requirement on the smoothness of the initial data and the kinetic equation has the mechanism to construct a dissipative wave structure starting from an initially discontinuous flow condition on a time scale being larger than the particle collision time. The current high-order flux evaluation method is an extension of the second-order gas-kinetic BGK scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations (BGK-NS). The novelty for the easy extension from a second-order to a higher order is due to the simple particle transport and collision mechanism on the microscopic level. This paper will present a hierarchy to construct such a high-order method. The necessity to couple spatial and temporal evolution nonlinearly in the flux evaluation can be clearly observed through the numerical performance of the scheme for the viscous flow computations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.",

Results of transmission and reflections at the orifice are presented on a two-port scattering matrix form and are compared to measurements with good agreement.

It is shown here that this deficiency can be easily remedied, and conservative procedures for advective forms can be developed from multiscale concepts.

We first relate the LBE to the finite discrete-velocity model (FDVM) of the Boltzmann equation with the diffusive scaling. The analysis of this model directly leads to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, as opposed to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations obtained by the Chapman–Enskog analysis with convective scaling. We also apply the asymptotic analysis directly to the fully discrete LBE, as opposed to the usual practice of analyzing a continuous equation obtained through the Taylor-expansion of the LBE. This leads to a consistency analysis which provides order-by-order information about the numerical solution of the LBE. The asymptotic technique enables us to analyze the structure of the leading order errors and the accuracy of numerically derived quantities, such as vorticity. It also justifies the use of Richardson’s extrapolation method. As an example, a two-dimensional Taylor-vortex flow is used to validate our analysis. The numerical results agree very well with our analytic predictions.",

          "abstract": "We present a Galerkin-free, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-assisted computational methodology for numerical simulations of the long-term dynamics of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The approach is based on the &quot;equation-free&quot; framework: we use short, appropriate initialized bursts of full direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations to observe, estimate, and accelerate, through &quot;projective integration&quot;, the evolution of the flow dynamics. The main assumption is that the long-term dynamics of the flow lie on a low-dimensional, attracting, and invariant manifold, which can be parametrized, not necessarily spanned, by a few POD basis functions. We start with a discussion of the consistency and accuracy of the approach, and then illustrate it through numerical examples: two-dimensional periodic and quasi-periodic flows past a circular cylinder. We demonstrate that the approach can successfully resolve complex flow dynamics at a reduced computational cost and that it can capture the long-term asymptotic state of the flow in cases where traditional Galerkin-POD models fail. The approach trades the overhead involved in developing POD-Galerkin and POD-nonlinear Galerkin codes, for the repeated (yet short, and on demand) use of an existing full DNS simulator. Moreover, since in this approach the POD modes are used to observe rather than span the true system dynamics, the computation is much less sensitive than POD-Galerkin to values of the system parameters (e.g., the Reynolds number) and the particular simulation data ensemble used to obtain the POD basis functions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

For this purpose, a paradigmatic problem in granular dynamics such as the Faraday instability is selected. Two different approaches for the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients for granular materials are considered, namely the traditional Jenkins-Richman theory for moderately dense quasi-elastic grains and the improved Garzo-Dufty-Lutsko theory for arbitrary inelasticity, which we also present here. Both the solutions are compared with event-driven simulations of the same system under the same conditions, by analyzing the density, temperature and velocity field. Important differences are found between the two approaches, leading to interesting implications. In particular, the heat transfer mechanism coupled to the density gradient, which is a distinctive feature of inelastic granular gases, is responsible for a major discrepancy in the temperature field and hence in the diffusion mechanisms.",

Analysis and experiments indicate that for an accurate representation of both layers the flux formula must include information about all different waves by which neighboring cells interact, as in Roe&#039;s flux-difference splitting. In comparison, Van Leer&#039;s flux-vector splitting, which ignores the linear waves, badly diffuses the boundary layer. The results of MacCormack&#039;s scheme, if properly tuned, are significantly better.

These considerations lead to the gas-kinetic traffic equation of Paveri-Fontana. Its stationary and spatially homogeneous solution implies equilibrium relations for the `fundamental diagram&#039;, the variance-density relation, and other quantities which are partly difficult to determine empirically. Paveri-Fontana&#039;s traffic equation allows the derivation of macroscopic moment equations which build a system of non-closed equations. This system can be closed by the well proved method of Chapman and Enskog which leads to Euler-like traffic equations in zeroth-order approximation and to Navier-Stokes-like traffic equations in first-order approximation. The latter are finally corrected for the finite space requirements of vehicles. It is shown that the resulting model is able to withstand the above mentioned criticism.",

In each time step a set of systems of linear equations has to be solved. The size of the time steps is restricted by stability and accuracy of the time-stepping scheme, and convergence of the iterative methods for the solution of the systems of equations. The stability is investigated with a linear model equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations on Cartesian grids. The resolution in space and time is estimated from turbulent flow physics. The convergence of the iterative solvers is discussed with respect to the time steps. The stability constraints obtained from the model equation are compared to results for a semi-explicit integrator of the Navier-Stokes equations with good agreement.

The method is appropriate for steady viscous channel flows and flows past rigid bodies where vorticity is generated by the viscous shear, and concentrated near the no-slip boundaries. The boundary integral method is presented along with the discussion of the kinetic and kinematic aspects of the problem. An iteralive method is required to reduce the integral boundary condition to a sequence of Dirichlet boundary conditions.

The LB method is a Lagrangian discretization of a discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation. We introduce an alternative, fourth-order discretization scheme and compare results with those of the LB discretization and with finite-difference schemes applied to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in primitive-variable form. A Chapman-Enskog expansion of the PDE system predicts that the macroscopic behavior corresponds to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with additional ‘compressibility error’ of order Mach number squared. We numerically demonstrate convergence of the BGK schemes to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and quantify the errors associated with compressibility and discretization effects. When compressibility error is smaller than discretization error, convergence in both grid spacing and time step is shown to be second-order for the LB method and is confirmed to be fourth-order for the fourth-order BGK solver. However, when the compressibility error is simultaneously reduced as the grid is refined, the LB method behaves as a first-order scheme in time.",

The MFS is a meshless method since it is free from the mesh generation and numerical integration. We will transform the Navier-Stokes equations into simple advection-diffusion and Poisson differential operators via the operator-splitting scheme or the so-called projection method, instead of directly using the more complicated fundamental solutions (Stokeslets) of the unsteady Stokes equations. The resultant velocity advection-diffusion equations and the pressure Poisson equation are then calculated by using the MFS together with the Eulerian-Lagrangian method (ELM) and the method of particular solutions (MPS). The proposed meshless numerical scheme is a first attempt to apply the MFS for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the moderate-Reynolds-number flow regimes. The lid-driven cavity flows at the Reynolds numbers up to 3200 for two-dimensional (2D) and 1000 for three-dimensional (3D) are chosen to validate the present algorithm. Through further simulating the flows in the 2D circular cavity with an eccentric rotating cylinder and in the 3D cube with a fixed sphere inside, we are able to demonstrate the advantages and flexibility of the proposed meshless method in the irregular geometry and multi-dimensional flows, even though very coarse node points are used in this study as compared with other mesh-dependent numerical schemes. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We consider an ensemble of direct numerical simulations in a square box with stress-free boundaries, with a Reynolds number that is of the same order as in experiments on 2D decaying Navier-Stokes turbulence. The results of these simulations are compared with the corresponding statistical equilibria, calculated from different stages of the evolution. It is shown that the statistical equilibria calculated from early times of the Navier-Stokes evolution do not correspond to the dynamical quasistationary states. At best, the global topological structure is correctly predicted from a relatively late time in the Navier-Stokes evolution, when the quasistationary state has almost been reached. This failure of the (basically inviscid) statistical-mechanical theory is related to viscous dissipation and net leakage of vorticity in the Navier-Stokes dynamics at moderate values of the Reynolds number.",

          "abstract": "We establish existence and stability of multidimensional shock fronts in the vanishing viscosity limit for a general class of conservation laws with &quot;real&quot;, or partially parabolic, viscosity including the Navier-Stokes equations of compressible gas dynamics with standard or van der Waals-type equation of state. More precisely, given a curved Lax shock solution u0 of the corresponding inviscid equations for which (i) each of the associated planar shocks tangent to the shock front possesses a smooth viscous profile and (ii) each of these viscous profiles satisfies a uniform spectral stability condition expressed in terms of an Evans function, we construct nearby smooth viscous shock solutions uε of the viscous equations converging to u0 as viscosity ε → 0, and establish for these sharp linearized stability estimates generalizing those of Majda in the inviscid case. Conditions (i)-(ii) hold always for shock waves of sufficiently small amplitude, but in general may fail for large amplitudes. We treat the viscous shock problem considered here as a representative of a larger class of multidimensional boundary problems arising in the study of viscous fluids, characterized by sharp spectral conditions rather than symmetry hypotheses, which can be analyzed by Kreiss-type symmetrizers. Compared to the strictly parabolic (artificial viscosity) case, the main new features of the analysis appear in the high frequency estimates for the linearized problem. In that regime we use frequency-dependent conjugators to decouple parabolic components that are smoothed from hyperbolic components (like density in Navier-Stokes) that are not. The construction of the conjugators and the subsequent estimates depend on a careful spectral analysis of the linearized operator. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.",

In contrast to the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation, the CHM equation admits &quot;shielded vortex solutions&quot; in a homogeneous limit and linear waves (&quot;Rossby waves&quot; in the planetary atmosphere and &quot;drift waves&quot; in plasmas) in the presence of inhomogeneity. Because of these properties, the nonlinear dynamics described by the CHM equation provide rich solutions which involve turbulent, coherent and wave behaviors. Bringing in nonideal effects such as resistivity makes the plasma equation significantly different from the atmospheric equation with such new effects as instability of the drift wave driven by the resistivity and density gradient. The model equation deviates from the CHM equation and becomes coupled with Maxwell equations. This article reviews the linear and nonlinear dynamics of the quasi-two-dimensional aspect of plasmas and planetary atmosphere starting from the introduction of the ideal model equation (CHM equation) and extending into the most recent progress in plasma turbulence.",

An overview of the different Navier–Stokes codes used in Europe is given, and on-going developments are outlined.

A discussion on the future industrial design environment is given, and developments in Europe towards a more integrated design approach with underlying concepts like ‘concurrent engineering (CE)’ and the ‘virtual product (VP)’ are summarized.

We performed a series of numerical simulation to analyze the hydrodynamic response and the power absorption performance of the system in regular waves. Overall, it was successful to use the RANS method to model the complex hydrodynamics interaction of the FPA system.

The agglomeration algorithm conforms with the finite-volume discretization scheme and operates independently of the algorithm used to define the concur- rently treated subdomains. The computational platform is a cluster of interconnected processors, each of which is associated with one subdomain and requires repetitive communication with the other processors, carried out through the PVM library. Emphasis is laid on (a) the agglomeration strategy, by comparing isotropic and directional agglomeration techniques depending on grid stretching, (b) the discretization schemes for the inviscid fluxes, based on identical edge-wise computations at any multigrid level along with flux limiting techniques, (c) the discretization schemes for the viscous fluxes, for which the triangle- or tetrahedron-based scheme on the fine mesh switches to a computationally less demanding edge-wise scheme on the coarser grids and (d) the modification to the multigrid operators for the one- and two-equation turbulence models. Isolated airfoil, wing and turbomachinery cascade flow problems are used to demonstrate the efficiency of multigrid.",

          "abstract": "We present a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in convection-dominated flows using triangular and tetrahedral meshes. The scheme is based on a semi-explicit temporal discretization with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the Stokes operator. The nonlinear term is discretized in divergence form by using the local Lax-Friedrichs fluxes; thus, local conservativity is inherent. Spatial discretization of the Stokes operator has employed both equal-order (Pk - Pk) and mixed-order (Pk - Pk-1) velocity and pressure approximations. A second-order approximate algebraic splitting is used to decouple the velocity and pressure calculations leading to an algebraic Helmholtz equation for each component of the velocity and a consistent Poisson equation for the pressure. The consistent Poisson operator is replaced by an equivalent (in stability and convergence) operator, namely that arising from the interior penalty discretization of the standard Poisson operator with appropriate boundary conditions. This yields a simpler and more efficient method, characterized by a compact stencil size. We show the temporal and spatial behavior of the method by solving some popular benchmarking tests. For an unsteady Stokes problem, second-order temporal convergence is obtained, while for the Taylor vortex test problem on both semi-structured and fully unstructured triangular meshes, spectral convergence with respect to the polynomial degree k is obtained. By studying the Orr-Sommerfeld stability problem, we demonstrate that the Pk - Pk method yields a stable solution, while the Pk - Pk-1 formulation leads to unphysical instability. The good performance of the method is further shown by simulating vortex shedding in flow past a square cylinder. We conclude that the proposed discontinuous Galerkin method with the Pk - Pk formulation is an efficient scheme for accurate and stable solution of the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in convection-dominated flows. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This method combines a quadrature free discontinuous Galerkin method for the level set equation with a pressure stabilized finite element method for the Navier Stokes equations. The main challenge in the computation of such flows is the accurate evaluation of surface tension forces. This involves the computation of the curvature of the fluid interface. In the context of the discontinuous Galerkin method, we show that the use of a curvature computed by means of a direct derivation of the level set function leads to inaccurate and oscillatory results. A more robust, second-order, least squares computation of the curvature that filters out the high frequencies and produces converged results is presented. This whole numerical technology allows to simulate a wide range of flow regimes with large density ratios, to accurately capture the shape of the deforming interface of the bubble and to maintain good mass conservation.",

We use pressure Poisson equation (PPE) formulation and propose new boundary conditions for the pressure on the open or traction boundaries. After replacing the divergence free constraint by this pressure Poisson equation, we obtain an unconstrained NSE. For Stokes equation with open boundary condition on a simple domain, we prove unconditional stability of a first order semi-implicit scheme where the pressure is treated explicitly and hence is decoupled from the computation of velocity. Using either boundary condition, the schemes for the full NSE that treat both convection and pressure terms explicitly work well with various spatial discretizations including spectral collocation and C0 finite elements. Moreover, when Reynolds number is of O (1) and when the first order semi-implicit time stepping is used, time step size of O (1) is allowed in benchmark computations for the full NSE. Besides standard stability and accuracy check, various numerical results including flow over a backward facing step, flow past a cylinder and flow in a bifurcated tube are reported. Numerically we have observed that using PPE formulation enables us to use the velocity/pressure pairs that do not satisfy the standard inf-sup compatibility condition.

          "abstract": "The complicated nature of the EHL-problem has so far forced researchers to develop their own computer codes. These codes are ultimately based on the Reynolds equation, and if thermal EHL-simulations are required, a simultaneous solution of the equation of energy also has to be performed. To date only a few attempts to solve the full equations of momentum and continuity as well as equations of energy have been performed. However, such an approach will give extended possibilities of simulating EHL-contacts; i.e. the computational domain can be expanded and it will be possible to simulate the flow, not only in the contact but also around the contact. Another possibility is to investigate how the altering length scales of the surface roughness influence the behaviour of the flow in the contact. However, the aim of the work presented in this paper is to investigate the possibilities of using a commercial CFD-code (computational fluid dynamics code) based on the above-mentioned equations for simulating thermal EHL. The rheology is assumed to be Newtonian and the equations of momentum and continuity are then commonly referred to as the Navier-Stokes equations (N-S equations). The geometry chosen for the simulations is a smooth line contact geometry, for which the results from the simulations show that it is possible to use the N-S equations for thermal EHL for contact pressures up to approximately 0.7 GPa. The code used in this work is the commercial CFD software (CFX 4.3 user guide). There is a limitation in the N-S approach due to a singularity that can occur in the equation of momentum when the principal shear stresses in the film become too high. However, a thermal approach makes it possible to simulate EHL-contacts at higher loads compared with an isothermal approach, due to the reduction of the viscosity in the former approach. The singularity is not present in the Reynolds approach. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Zhong, Derivation of high-order compact finite difference schemes for non-uniform grid using polynomial interpolation, J. Comput. Phys. 204 (2005) 404] for linear model equations are extended to the full Navier-Stokes equations in the vorticity and streamfunction formulation. Two methods for the solution of Helmholtz and Poisson equations using high-order compact schemes on non-uniform grids are developed. The schemes are constructed so that they maintain a high-order of accuracy not only in the interior but also at the boundary. Second-order semi-implicit temporal discretization is achieved through an implicit Backward Differentiation scheme for the linear viscous terms and an explicit Adam-Bashforth scheme for the non-linear convective terms. The boundary values of vorticity are determined using an influence matrix technique. The resulting discretized system with boundary closures of the same high-order as the interior is shown to be stable, when applied to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, provided enough grid points are clustered at the boundary. The resolution characteristics of the high-order compact finite difference schemes are illustrated through their application to the one-dimensional linear wave equation and the two-dimensional driven cavity flow. Comparisons with the benchmark solutions for the two-dimensional driven cavity flow, thermal convection in a square box and flow past an impulsively started cylinder show that the high-order compact schemes are stable and produce extremely accurate results on a stretched grid with more points clustered at the boundary. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The two-mass model is coupled to a model of glottal airflow based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Glottal waves are produced using different initial glottal gaps and different subglottal pressures. Fundamental frequency, glottal peak flow, and closed phase of the glottal waves have been compared with values known from the literature, The phonation threshold pressure was determined for different initial glottal gaps. The phonation threshold pressure obtained using the flow model with Navier-Stokes equations corresponds better to values determined in normal phonation than the phonation threshold pressure obtained using the flow model based on the Bernoulli equation. Using the Navier-Stokes equations, an increase of the subglottal pressure causes the fundamental frequency and the glottal peak flow to increase, whereas the fundamental frequency in the Bernoulli-based model does not change with increasing pressure.

We solve the steady state equations by advancing in time using a backward Euler (BE) scheme. To avoid the inversion of a large matrix we approximate BE by an implicit lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) algorithm. The implicit method addresses the stiffness in the discrete Navier-Stokes equations associated with stretched meshes. The LU-SGS algorithm is then used as a smoother for a p-multigrid approach. A Von Neumann stability analysis is applied to the two-dimensional linear advection equation to determine its damping properties. The implicit LU-SGS scheme is used to solve the two-dimensional (2D) compressible laminar Navier-Stokes equations. We compute the solution of a laminar external flow over a cylinder and around an airfoil at low Mach number. We compare the convergence rates with explicit Runge-Kutta (E-RK) schemes employed as a smoother. The effects of the cell aspect ratio and the low Mach number on the convergence are investigated. With the p-multigrid method and the implicit smoother the computational time can be reduced by a factor of up to 5-10 compared with a well tuned E-RK scheme. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Important new features of the numerical method are the use of nonequidistant differences in the wall-normal direction; the use of split- compact differences in the streamwise direction; a new, fast iteration for a semi-implicit time integration of the wall- normal diffusion terms; and an improvement of the buffer domain technique to prevent reflections of waves at the outflow boundary.

In addition, the Boundary Layer Transition Flight Experiment2 made thermocouple measurements at discrete locations on the Orbiter wind side. Most of these measurements were made downstream of a surface protuberance designed to trip the boundary layer to turbulent flow. In this paper, we use the US3D computational fluid dynamics code to simulate the Orbiter flow field at conditions corresponding to the STS-119 re-entry. We employ a standard two-temperature, five-species finite-rate model for high-temperature air, and the surface catalysis model of Stewart. 3 This work is similar to the analysis of Wood et al.4 except that we use a different approach for modeling turbulent flow. We use the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model5 with compressibility corrections6 and an approach for tripping the boundary layer at discrete locations. In general, the comparison between the simulations and flight data is remarkably good.",

For the Prandtl equations, Cauchy-Kowalewski is applicable once the diffusion operator in the vertical direction is inverted.",

Details of the aforementioned analytical solution are presented, and results are extended to include a general shear- and force-driven unidirectional flow in confined geometry. Exact solutions for the velocity, as well as for pertinent higher-order moments of the distribution functions, are obtained in both Couette and Poiseuille steady-state flows for all values of rarefaction parameter (Knudsen number). Results are compared with the slip flow solution by Cercignani, and a good quantitative agreement is found for both flow situations.

The key feature of the work presented in this paper is that the computer storage requirements of the full matrix inversion resulting from direct solution of the pressure Poisson equation in three dimensions is greatly reduced by considering an eigenfunction decomposition. The method was tested on a two-dimensional driven cavity flow and the results were compared with those of the most accurate finite-difference calculation. The three-dimensional driven cavity flow was then calculated at the same Reynolds numbers as the two-dimensional cases, i.e., Re = 100, 400, and 1000.

          "abstract": "An explicit staggered projection method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with no-slip walls is analyzed and used in simulations to address several issues related to the pressure boundary condition required when the continuity equation is replaced by the standard pressure Poisson equation (PPE), ???;2p = ???; {dot operator} ( - u {dot operator} ???;u + f). First, it is shown that a PPE system supplemented with a Neumann pressure boundary condition derived from the momentum equation can be made consistent with the Navier-Stokes equations if it is extended with the requirement that ???; {dot operator} ???;2u = 0 is zero near the wall and the solution is sufficiently smooth. This implies that it is possible to formulate a boundary condition for the standard PPE without the necessity to resort to Green&#039;s functions, which is interesting for theoretical reasons. Second, the equivalence is shown between the staggered projection method and the staggered discretization of above PPE system. The derivation of the equivalence sheds light upon the so-called PPE paradox and leads to an approximation of the wall value of ???p/ ??? n, which is not required but implied by the staggered projection method. Third, the (near-wall) regularity of a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is numerically analyzed by means of Direct Numerical Simulation of turbulent channel flow performed with the staggered projection method. From the numerical inspection of all terms of the momentum equation in the near-wall region, it is concluded that the three components of the momentum equation are satisfied on the wall for t &gt; 0 (for short times, but also in the turbulent regime). In the limit t ??? 0, the pressure gradient is observed to converge to the initial pressure gradient in the L2-norm, which confirms a disputed theoretical result in literature. Even in the maximum norm, the pressure gradient appears to converge to the initial pressure gradient. The only discontinuities observed in the simulations are the discontinuities of the tangential viscous terms and the time derivatives of the tangential velocities on the wall at t = 0. Thus the numerical results indicate that the regularity of the solution for turbulent channel flow is stronger than claimed by existing theory. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics techniques employing primarily steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methodology have been recently used to characterize the transitional/turbulent flow field in human airways. The use of RANS implies that flow phenomena are averaged over time, the flow dynamics not being captured. Further, RANS uses two-equation turbulence models that are not adequate for predicting anisotropic flows, flows with high streamline curvature, or flows where separation occurs. A more accurate approach for such flow situations that occur in the human airway is Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The paper considers flow modeling in a pharyngeal airway model reconstructed from cross-sectional magnetic resonance scans of a patient with obstructive sleep apnea. The airway model is characterized by a maximum narrowing at the site of retropalatal pharynx. Two flow-modeling strategies are employed: steady RANS and the LES approach. In the RANS modeling framework both ??-?? and ??-?? turbulence models are used. The paper discusses the differences between the airflow characteristics obtained from the RANS and LES calculations. The largest discrepancies were found in the axial velocity distributions downstream of the minimum cross-sectional area. This region is characterized by flow separation and large radial velocity gradients across the developed shear layers. The largest difference in static pressure distributions on the airway walls was found between the LES and the ??-?? data at the site of maximum narrowing in the retropalatal pharynx. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

International Journal of Numerical Methods in Engineering 1998; 41: 1131-1151), the authors proposed an efficient method of solving the Navier-Stokes equations by reducing their number of modes. Employing the empirical eigenfunctions of the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition as basis functions of a Galerkin procedure, one can a priori limit the function space considered to the smallest linear sub-space that is sufficient to describe the observed phenomena, and consequently, reduce the Navier-Stokes equations defined on a complicated geometry to a set of ordinary differential equations with a minimum degree of freedom. In the present work, we apply this technique, termed the Karhunen-Loeve Galerkin procedure, to a pointwise control problem of Navier-Stokes equations. The Karhunen-Loeve Galerkin procedure is found to be much more efficient than the traditional method, such as finite difference method in obtaining optimal control profiles when the minimization of the objective function has been done by using a conjugate gradient method.

For fluid-type motions such as smoke or clouds, the constant brightness assumption does not hold, and accurately estimating the motion flow from their images is difficult. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective Navier-Stokes (NS) potential flow model for recovering fluid-type motions. Our method treats the image as a wavefront surface and models the 3D potential flow beneath the surface. The gradient of the velocity potential describes the motion flow at every voxel. We first derive a general brightness constraint that explicitly models wavefront (brightness) variations in terms of the velocity potential. We then use a series of partial differential equations to separately model the dynamics of the potential flow. To solve for the potential flow, we use the Dirichlet-Neumann Operator (DNO) to simplify the 3D volumetric velocity potential to 2D surface velocity potential. We approximate the DNO via Taylor expansions and develop a Fourier domain method to efficiently estimate the Taylor coefficients. Finally we show how to use the DNO to recover the velocity potential from images as well as to propagate the wavefront (image) over time. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images show that our technique is robust and reliable.",

This paper presents a level-set method for topology optimization of steady-state Navier-Stokes flow subject to a specific fluid volume constraint. The solid-fluid interface is implicitly characterized by a zero-level contour of a higher-order scalar level set function and can be naturally transformed to other configurations as its host moves. A variational form of the cost function is constructed based upon the adjoint variable and Lagrangian multiplier techniques. To satisfy the volume constraint effectively, the Lagrangian multiplier derived from the first-order approximation of the cost function is amended by the bisection algorithm. The procedure allows evolving initial design to an optimal shape and/or topology by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Two classes of benchmarking examples are presented in this paper: (1) periodic microstructural material design for the maximum permeability; and (2) topology optimization of flow channels for minimizing energy dissipation.

          "abstract": "Fluid flows are very often governed by the dynamics of a mall number of coherent structures, i.e., fluid features which keep their individuality during the evolution of the flow. The purpose of this paper is to study a low order simulation of the Navier–Stokes equations on the basis of the evolution of such coherent structures. One way to extract some basis functions which can be interpreted as coherent structures from flow simulations is by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). Then, by means of a Galerkin projection, it is possible to find the system of ODEs which approximates the problem in the finite-dimensional space spanned by the POD basis functions. It is found that low order modeling of relatively complex flow simulations, such as laminar vortex shedding from an airfoil at incidence and turbulent vortex shedding from a square cylinder, provides good qualitative results compared with reference computations. In this respect, it is shown that the accuracy of numerical schemes based on simple Galerkin projection is insufficient and numerical stabilization is needed. To conclude, we approach the issue of the optimal selection of the norm, namely the H 1 norm, used in POD for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations by several numerical tests.",

The issue of how to correctly specify numerical boundary conditions for these methods has been outstanding since the birth of the second-order methodology a decade and a half ago. It has been observed that while the velocity can be reliably computed to second-order accuracy in time and space, the pressure is typically only first-order accurate in the L∞-norm. This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary conditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed. The connection between the boundary conditions for projection methods and the gauge method is explained in detail.",

Daube (J. Comput. Phys.103,402 (1992)) the influence matrix is built by enforcing either the definition of the vorticity or the continuity equation at the boundary of the domain. The influence matrix is nonsingular in both cases. The order of the influence matrix is twice larger than one would expect from analogous solution methods based on finite differences or finite elements. The spatial discretization is based on a 2D Chebyshev expansion on anonstaggeredgrid of collocation points, and the boundary conditions are imposed via the Lanczos tau procedure. The time marching scheme is Adams–Bashforth for the advection term and Crank–Nicolson for the viscous term. The proposed scheme yields machine accurate divergence–free flow fields, and the definition of the vorticity is satisfied within machine accuracy.",

          "abstract": "The problem of two-dimensional incompressible laminar flow past a bluff body at large Reynolds number (R) is discussed. The governing equations are the Navier-Stokes equations. A solution for R large should be obtained by a perturbation of an Euler solution. However, for given boundary conditions, the Euler solution is not unique. The solution to be perturbed is the relevant Euler solution, namely the one which is the Euler limit of the Navier-Stokes solution with the same boundary conditions. For flow past a bluff body, the relevant Euler solution is not known, although the free streamline flow for which the free streamline detaches smoothly from the body is a likely candidate. Possibilities of scaling for the various regions are discussed here. A famous paper by Goldstein asserts that for an adverse smooth pressure gradient, the solution of the boundary layer equations can, in general, not be continued beyond the point of separation. Subsequent attempts by many authors to overcome the difficulty of continuation have failed. A very promising theory, going beyond conventional boundary layer theory, has recently been put forward independently by Sychev and Messiter. They assume that separation takes place in a sublayer whose thickness and length tend to zero as R tends to infinity. The pressure gradient in the sublayer is self-induced and is positive upstream of the point of separation and zero downstream.",

This approach has been increasingly used over the last few years to solve mathematical problems. The originality of this work consists in the association of PGD with a spectral collocation method to solve transfer equations as well as Navier-Stokes equations. In the first stage, the PGD method and its association with spectral discretization is detailed. This approach was tested for several problems: the Poisson equation, the Darcy problem, Navier-Stokes equations (the Taylor Green problem and the lid-driven cavity). In the Navier-Stokes problems, the coupling between velocity and pressure was performed using a fractional step scheme and a PN-PN-2 discretization. For all problems considered, the results from PGD simulations were compared with those obtained by a standard solver and/or with the results found in the literature. The simulations performed showed that PGD is as accurate as standard solvers. PGD preserves the spectral behavior of the errors in velocity and pressure when the time step or the space step decreases. Moreover, for a given number of discretization nodes, PGD is faster than the standard solvers. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Anisotropies occur naturally in computational fluid dynamics where the simulation of small-scale physical phenomena, such as boundary layers at high Reynolds numbers, causes the grid to be highly stretched, leading to a slowdown in convergence of multigrid methods. Several approaches aimed at making multigrid a robust solver have been proposed and analyzed in the literature using the scalar diffusion equation. However, they have rarely been applied to solving more complicated models, such as the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. This paper contains the first published numerical results of the behavior of two popular robust multigrid approaches (alternating-plane smoothers combined with standard coarsening and plane-implicit smoothers combined with semi-coarsening) for solving the 3-D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in the simulation of the driven-cavity and a boundary layer over a flat plate on a stretched grid. Grid size, grid stretching, and Reynolds number are the factors considered in evaluating the robustness of the multi-grid methods. Both approaches yield large increases in convergence rates over cell-implicit smoothers on stretched grids. The combination of plane-implicit smoothers and semi-coarsening was found to be fully robust in the flat-plate simulation up to Reynolds numbers 10^6 and the best alternative in the driven-cavity simulation for Reynolds numbers above 10^3. The alternating-plane approach exhibits a better behavior for lower Reynolds numbers (below 10^3) in the driven-cavity simulation.",

The non-staggered-grid method originally developed by C. M. Rhie and W. L. Chow (AIAAJ.21, 1525 (1983)) for steady state problems is extended to compute unsteady flows. In the computational space, the Cartesian velocity components and the pressure are defined at the center of a control volume, while the volume fluxes are defined at the mid-point on their corresponding cell faces. The momentum equations are integrated semi-implicitly by the approximate factorization technique. The intermediate velocities are interpolated onto the faces of the control volume to form the source terms of the pressure Poisson equation, which is solved iteratively with a multigrid method. The compatibility condition of the pressure Poisson equation is satisfied in the same manner as in a staggered-grid method; mass conservation can be satisfied to machine accuracy. The pressure boundary condition is derived from the momentum equations. Solutions of both steady and unsteady problems including the large eddy simulation of a rotating and stratified upwelling flow in an irregular container established the favorable accuracy and efficiency of the present method.",

In this paper, the unconditional convergence property of the DPSS iteration method is proved and a relaxed DPSS (RDPSS) preconditioner is proposed. The RDPSS preconditioner is much closer to the coefficient matrix than the DPSS preconditioner in certain norm, which straightforwardly results in an RDPSS iteration method. The convergence conditions of the RDPSS iteration are analyzed and the optimal parameter, which minimizes the spectral radius of the RDPSS iteration matrix, is derived. Using the RDPSS preconditioner to accelerate some Krylov subspace methods (like GMRES) is also studied. The eigenproperty of the preconditioned matrix is described and an upper bound of the degree of the minimal polynomial of the preconditioned matrix is obtained.

This basis is obtained from the solution of a generalized constrained Stokes eigen-problem in the domain of interest. Faster convergence can be achieved by constructing a singular Stokes eigen-problem in which the Stokes operator is modified to include a variable coefficient which vanishes at the domain boundaries. The convergence properties of such functions are advantageous in a least squares sense and are shown to produce significantly better approximations to the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in post-critical states where unsteadiness characterizes the flowfield. Solutions for the eigen-systems are efficiently accomplished using a combined Laoczos-Uzawa algorithm and spectral element discretizations. Results are presented for different simulations using these global spectral trial basis on non-separable and multiply-connected domains. It is confirmed that faster convergence is obtained using the singular eigen-expansions in approximating stationary Navier-Stokes solutions in general domains. It is also shown that 100-mode expansions of time-dependent solutions based on the singular Stokes eigenfunctions are sufficient to accurately predict the dynamics of flows in such domains, including Hopf bifurcations, intermittency, and details of flow structures.",

Many numerical techniques have been developed to deal with this problem, and previous studies have reported on internal wave makers that employ NSE. Research on generation and transformation of irregular waves using a three-dimensional NSE model, however, has begun very recently, and few studies have yet been reported. In this study, a three-dimensional numerical model was applied to generate irregular waves, and transformation of irregular waves was simulated in a numerical wave tank. The model was first verified by applying it to simple numerical tests in two dimensions. The model was then used to generate directional monochromatic and irregular waves in three dimensions. The numerical results were compared with the analytical solutions, and good agreement was observed. Finally, the model was applied to simulate the transformation of irregular waves over an uneven bottom geometry in a wave tank.",

The Roe&#039;s numerical scheme is used to discretize the convective terms of governing fluid flow equations and simple upwinding method is used to discretize the equation of continuity of species. A complete model for mass diffusion which consists of ordinary, thermal and pressure terms is employed. The goal of this study is to investigate effects of viscosity, mass diffusion and especially thermal diffusion, on flow fields consisting of different mixtures. It is shown that the thermal mass diffusion can have profound effect on some flow fields, especially when the temperature gradient is not small. However, pressure mass diffusion can be negligible in the most of conventional problems. ?? Published by The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Then we show that this filtering causes the wavenumber spectrum of the translational kinetic energy for the NS-?? model to roll off as k-3 for k?? &gt; 1 in three dimensions, instead of continuing along the slower Kolmogorov scaling law, k-5/3, that it follows for k?? &lt; 1. This roll off at higher wavenumbers shortens the inertial range for the NS-?? model and thereby makes it more computable. We also explain how the NS-?? model is related to large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence modeling and to the stress tensor for second-grade fluids. We close by surveying recent results in the literature for the NS-?? model and its inviscid limit (the Euler-?? model). ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",

These surface data were used as input to two finite ele-m e n t codes that solve the Navier-Stokes equations and the Reynolds equation, respectively. Numerical simulations of flow through these measured aperture fields were carried out at different values of the mean aperture, corresponding to different values of the relative roughness. Flow experiments were also conducted in casts of two regions of the fracture. At low Reynolds numbers, the Navier-Stokes simulations yielded transmissivities for the two fracture regions that were closer to the experimental values than were the values predicted by the lubrication model. In general, the lubrication model overestimated the transmissivity by an amount that varied as a function of the relative roughness, defined as the standard deviation of the aperture divided by the mean aperture. The initial deviations from linearity, for Reynolds numbers in the range 1-10, were consistent with the &quot;weak inertia&quot; model developed by Mei and Auriault for porous media, and with the results obtained computationally by Skjetne et al in 1999 on a two-dimensional self-affine fracture. In the regime 10 &lt; Re &lt; 40, both the computed and measured transmissivities could be fit very well to a Forchheimer-type equation, in which the additional pressure drop varies quadratically with the Reynolds number.",

          "abstract": "A revision of Newton&#039;s law of viscosity appearing in the role of the deviatoric stress tensor in the Navier–Stokes equation is proposed for the case of compressible fluids, both gaseous and liquid. Explicitly, it is hypothesized that the velocity  v  appearing in the velocity gradient term  v  in Newton&#039;s rheological law be changed from the fluid&#039;s mass-based velocity  v m , the latter being the velocity appearing in the continuity equation, to the fluid&#039;s volume velocity  v v , the latter being a stand-in for the fluid&#039;s volume current (volume flux density  n v ). A similar  v m → v v  alteration is proposed for the velocity  v  appearing in the no-slip tangential velocity boundary condition at solid surfaces. These proposed revisions are based upon both experiment and theory, including re-interpretation of the following three items: (i) experimental “near-continuum” thermophoretic and other low Reynolds number phoretic data for the movement of suspended particles in fluids under the influence of mass density gradients  ρ , caused either by temperature gradients in single-component fluids undergoing heat transfer or by species concentration gradients in inhomogeneous two-component mixtures undergoing mass transfer; (ii) the hierarchical re-ordering of the Burnett terms appearing in the Chapman–Enskog gas-kinetic theory perturbation expansion of the viscous stress tensor from one of being based upon small Knudsen numbers to one of being based upon small Mach numbers; (iii) Maxwell&#039;s (1879) ubiquitous  v m -based “thermal creep” or “thermal stress” slip boundary condition used in nonisothermal gas-kinetic theory models, recast in the form of a  v v -based no-slip condition. The  v v  vs.  v m  dichotomy in the case of compressible fluids is shown to lead to a fundamental distinction between the fluid&#039;s tracer velocity as recorded by monitoring the spatio-temporal trajectory of a small non-Brownian particle deliberately introduced into the fluid, and the fluid&#039;s “optical” or “colorimetric” velocity as monitored, for example, by the introduction of a dye into the fluid or by some photochromic- or fluorescence-based scheme in circumstances where the individual fluid molecules are themselves responsive to being probed by light. Explicitly, it is argued that the fluid&#039;s tracer velocity, representing a strictly continuum nonmolecular notion, is  v v , whereas its colorimetric velocity, which measures the mean velocity of the molecules of which the fluid is composed, is  v m .",

          "abstract": "Fractional step methods integrate the Navier-Stokes equations in a non-iterative fashion. The commonly used P2 pressure correction fractional step method introduces a second order in time error into the solution as a result of the non-iterative approach. In this paper two alternative fractional step methods are examined in which the additional error is third order in time. One of the methods extends the standard P2 method to increase the accuracy of the approximate pressure included in the momentum equations, and is denoted the P3 method. The other method solves a Poisson pressure equation prior to the solution of the momentum, and is denoted the pressure method. Both alternative methods are shown to reduce the overall error and increase the efficiency as compared to the standard method.",

The important focus in PANS is how the control parameter which is the ratio of unresolved-to-total turbulent kinetic energy is determined in the flow field. In this work, the parameter is evaluated by using an equation that we propose. The model equation utilizes the turbulent length scale, the Kolmogorov length scale and the cut-off grid length. We first perform RANS simulation to approximately evaluate the turbulent length scale and the Kolmogorov length scale. Then we construct five different grid systems based on these length scales and perform PANS simulation in which the length scales to determine control parameter are also updated as the simulation proceeds. Simulation results are compared with experimental data and the other LES and DES results. The comparison suggests that PANS approach is very effective in simulating separated turbulent flows in the sense that accurate predictions can be obtained by using a much coarser grid system than is required for LES. We then suggest the grid spacing requirements for a proper PANS simulation.",

The main originality of the method consists of using the operator (I-∂xx)(I-∂yy)(I-∂zz) for approximating the pressure correction instead of the Poisson operator as done in all the contemporary projection methods. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of projection methods, and it is shown the have the same stability properties as the Poisson-based pressure-correction techniques, either in standard or rotational form. The first-order (in time) version of the method is proved to have the same convergence properties as the classical first-order projection techniques. Numerical tests reveal that the second-order version of the method has the same convergence rate as its second-order projection counterpart as well. The method is suitable for parallel implementation and preliminary tests show excellent parallel performance on a distributed memory cluster of up to 1024 processors. The method has been validated on the three-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow using grids composed of up to 2×109 points. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

The derivation of equations follows a three-step method recently developed for the PML of linearized Euler equations. To increase the efficiency of the PML, a pseudo mean flow is introduced in the formulation of absorption equations. The proposed PML equations will absorb exponentially the difference between the nonlinear fluctuation and the prescribed pseudo mean flow. With the nonlinearity in flux vectors, the proposed nonlinear absorbing equations are not formally perfectly matched to the governing equations as their linear counter-parts are. However, numerical examples show satisfactory results. Furthermore, the nonlinear PML reduces automatically to the linear PML upon linearization about the pseudo mean flow. The validity and efficiency of proposed equations as absorbing boundary conditions for nonlinear Euler and Navier–Stokes equations are demonstrated by numerical examples.",

          "abstract": "The Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations are shown to be strictly applicable only to incompressible flows, namely those involving fluids whose density is uniform throughout. Linear irreversible thermodynamic principles are used to derive an amended set of mass, momentum, and energy equations applicable to all fluids, compressible and incompressible, liquids as well as gases. These reduce to those of NSF in the incompressible limit. A modification of Fourier&#039;s heat-conduction constitutive law is also required as a consequence of the mass/volume velocity difference, wherein the heat flux is now defined in relation to the Second- rather than First-law of thermodynamics; that is, the heat flux is expressed in terms of entropy transport rather than energy transport, with the distinction between the two fluxes vanishing for incompressible flows. When solved subject to a no-slip boundary condition imposed on the fluid&#039;s volume velocity rather than on its mass velocity, the amended NSF equations are noted to furnish results in accord with a variety of experimental data for isothermal and nonisothermal, compressible and incompressible, gas and liquid flows. The difference between the fluid&#039;s volume and mass velocities, namely the diffuse flux of volume, is shown to constitute the hydrodynamic-level manifestation of the fluid&#039;s biased Brownian motion, with the bias arising from the inhomogeneity in mass distribution arising in compressible fluids from temperature or pressure gradients. Previously, continuum hydrodynamics, as embodied in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, has overlooked the fundamental contribution to fluid mechanics emanating from biased Brownian motion. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Differently from conventional FVM where the volume integrated average (VIA) value is the only computational variable, the present formulation treats both VIA and the point value (PV) as the computational variables which are updated separately at each time step. The VIA is computed from a finite volume scheme of flux form, and is thus numerically conservative. The PV is updated from the differential form of the governing equation that does not have to be conservative but can be solved in a very efficient way. Including PV as the additional variable enables us to make higher-order reconstructions over compact mesh stencil to improve the accuracy, and moreover, the resulting numerical model is more robust for unstructured grids.We present the numerical formulations in both two and three dimensions on triangular and tetrahedral mesh elements. Numerical results of several benchmark tests are also presented to verify the proposed numerical method as an accurate and robust solver for incompressible flows on unstructured grids. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",

The other is that the long-term dynamics of the determining form contains that of the NSE; the traveling wave solutions of the determining form, i.e., those of the form $v(t,s)=v_0(t+s)$, correspond exactly to initial data $v_0$ that are projections of solutions of the global attractor of the NSE onto the determining modes. The determining form is also shown to be dissipative; an estimate for the radius of an absorbing ball is derived in terms of the number of determining modes and the Grashof number (a dimensionless physical parameter). Finally, a unified approach is outlined for an ODE satisfied by a variety of other determining parameters such as nodal values, finite volumes, and finite elements.",

The flow through individual pores in the margo was strongly dependent on pore area, but also on the radial location of the pore with respect to the edge of the torus. • Model results suggest that only a few per cent of the pores in the margo account for nearly half of the flow and these pores tend to be located in the inner region of the margo where their contribution will be maximized. A high density of strands in outer portions of the margo (hence narrower pores) may be more significant for mechanical support of the torus.",

The velocity and density fluctuations around the macroscopic dynamics are governed by a Fokker-Planck equation. From the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, a relation between the velocity fluctuations and the temperature is obtained which allows to derive the linear Langevin equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics.

          "abstract": "The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been widely used for the simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. The finite difference Boltzmann method (FDBM) in which the discrete-velocity Boltzmann equation is solved instead of the lattice Boltzmann equation has also been applied as an alternative method for simulating the incompressible flows. The particle velocities of the FDBM can be selected independently from the lattice configuration. In this paper, taking account of this advantage, we present the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation that has a minimum set of the particle velocities with the lattice Bharnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model for the three-dimensional incompressible NS equations. To recover incompressible NS equations, tensors of the particle velocities have to be isotropic up to the fifth rank. Thus, we propose to apply the icosahedral vectors that have 13 degrees of freedom to the particle velocity distributions. Validity of the proposed model (D3Q13BGK) is confirmed by numerical simulations of the shear-wave decay problem and the Taylor-Green vortex problem. With respect to numerical accuracy, computational efficiency and numerical stability, we compare the proposed model with the conventional lattice BGK models (D3Q15, D3Q19 and D3Q27) and the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) model (D3Q13MRT) that has the same degrees of freedom as our proposal. The comparisons show that the compressibility error of the proposed model is approximately double that of the conventional lattice BGK models, but the computational efficiency of the proposed model is superior to that of the others. The linear stability of the proposed model is also superior to that of the lattice BGK models. However, in non-linear simulations, the proposed model tends to be less stable than the others. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

This paper identifies the source of this problem in the interplay of the global pressure-update formula with the numerical boundary con- ditions and presents an improved projection algorithm which is fully second-order accurate, as demonstrated by a normal mode analysis and numerical experiments. In addition, a numerical method based on a gauge variable formulation of the incom- pressible Navier–Stokes equations, which provides another option for obtaining fully second-order convergence in both velocity and pressure, is discussed.

It was pointed out by a few authors (and not widely known apparently) that it can also lead to a less accurate approximate solution than the usual u · ∇ u form. We give a different explanation of this effect related to (i) resolution of the Bernoulli pressure, and (ii) the scaling of the coupling between velocity and pressure error with respect to the Reynolds number. We show analytically that (i) the difference between the two nonlinearities is governed by the difference in the resolution of the Bernoulli and kinematic pressures, and (ii) a simple, linear grad-div stabilization ameliorates much of the bad scaling of the velocity error with respect to Re. The rotation form does have superior conservation properties to the alternatives and it appears to be amenable to more efficient preconditioners. Thus, the rotational form with grad-div stabilization is a promising method. We also give experiments that show bad velocity approximation is tied to poor pressure resolution in either form. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

This simple modification is shown to implicitly take care of the complexities associated in the transitional flow regime, without necessitating dependency of the slip coefficients on the Knudsen number. Unique analytical model with fixed values of slip coefficients is proposed and rigorous comparisons with the experimental and simulation data for pressure driven and thermally driven rarefied gas flows support this conjecture.

          "abstract": "The two-dimensional incompressible fluid flow problems governed by the velocity-vorticity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations were solved using the radial basis integral (RBIE) equation method. The RBIE is a meshless method based on the multi-domain boundary element method with overlapping subdomains. It solves at each node for the potential and its spatial derivatives. This feature of the RBIE is advantageous in solving the velocity-vorticity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations since the calculated velocity gradients can be used to compute the vorticity that is prescribed as a boundary condition to the vorticity transport equation. The accuracy of the numerical solution was examined by solving the test problem with known analytical solution. Two benchmark problems, i.e. the lid driven cavity flow and the thermally driven cavity flow were also solved. The numerical results obtained using the RBIE showed very good agreement with the benchmark solutions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

Numerical inf-sup stability tests for the simplified Stokes problem confirm the existence of many stable discretizations of the velocity and pressure spaces, and in particular show that stability may be achieved by means of knot refinement of the velocity space. Error convergence studies for the full Navier-Stokes problem show optimal convergence rates for this type of discretizations. Finally, a comparison of the results of the method to data from the literature for the lid-driven square cavity for Reynolds numbers up to 10,000 serves as benchmarking of the discretizations and confirms the robustness of the method. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

The splitting is obtained through an algebraic approximate factorization of the matrix arising from space and time discretization of the original equations. Several schemes based on approximate factorization are investigated. For some of these methods a formal analogy with well known time advancing schemes, such as the projection Chorin-Temam&#039;s, can be pointed out. Features and limits of this analogy (that was earlier introduced in B. Perot, J. Comp. Phys. 108 (1993) 51-58) are addressed. Other, new methods can also be formulated starting from this approach: in particular, we introduce here the so called Yosida method, which can be investigated in the framework of quasi-compressibility schemes. Numerical results illustrating the different performances of the different methods here addressed are presented for a couple of test cases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",

Although a critical aerodynamic spot, the aerodynamics of the roof of the building are far from fully researched. Previous work using CFD as been based on steady flow Navier-Stokes models, mostly 2D. In order to obtain accurate results and bearing in mind that the flow is unsteady around a building, it will be more suitable to use Unsteady Navier-Stokes models (Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes -URANS- and Large Eddy Simulation -LES). Hence, to better understand the behavior of wind on the roof of a building in a built environment, 3D URANS and LES models have been computed for a cubic shaped building in a modeled atmospheric boundary layer flow. The work presents the results for the flow over the roof of the cubic building considered relevant for wind energy conversion.© 2006 APC Power Conversion Ltd.",

          "abstract": "We outline a new class of robust and efficient methods for solving subproblems that arise in the linearization and operator splitting of Navier–Stokes equations. We describe a very general strategy for preconditioning that has two basic building blocks; a multigrid V-cycle for the scalar convection–diffusion operator, and a multigrid V-cycle for a pressure Poisson operator. We present numerical experiments illustrating that a simple implementation of our approach leads to an effective and robust solver strategy in that the convergence rate is independent of the grid, robust with respect to the time-step, and only deteriorates very slowly as the Reynolds number is increased.",

          "abstract": "This paper concerns the extension of the gas-kinetic scheme for the compressible Navier Stokes equations to the flow calculation with interfaces and mixing. The objective of the current research targets mainly on the accurate capturing of Navier-Stokes diffusive interfaces, where the thickness can be resolved by the cell size. Firstly, a new BGK-NS scheme coupling with the level set type scalar function transport is constructed. Even though the scalar function is directly incorporated into the gas distribution function and it evolves according to the gas-kinetic equation, it likes more or less a color function, which has no direct contribution for the time evolution of conservative flow variables, such as mass, momentum and energy. Due to the coupling of the scalar function into the gas-kinetic formulation, the governing equations for the scalar function turns out to be an advection diffusion equations and the diffusive coefficient can be controlled by the particle collision time, which makes the current scheme suitable for the gas mixing problems with a controllable diffusion coefficients. However, for the non-mixing or sharp interface problems, such as the interface between gas and liquid, the current method can be used as a scheme similar to the level set method, where the interface location can be identified with a fixed level set value, such as Theta = 0. The current method is applied to a few examples from the simple square wave propagation and diffusion to the 3D Rayleigh Taylor instability. The supersonic mixing layer and the shock helium bubble interaction case show clearly the convergence of the current Navier-Stokes solver for the flow problems with mixing of components and interface once the interface thickness can be well resolved by the cell size. In the case of shock hitting SF6 cylinder, the computation predicts the experimental measure very well. In the current scheme, the Schmidt number can be freely chosen according to the physical reality. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

It is remarkable that such flaw has not being noticed before, neither detected in numerical experiments. In this work, a series of objectivity tests have been designed with the purpose of revealing such problem in real numerical experiments. Through the tests it is shown how, for slip boundaries or free-surfaces, Laplace formulations generate non-physical solutions which widely depart from the real fluid dynamics. These tests can be easily reproduced, not requiring complex simulation tools. Furthermore, they can be used as benchmarks to check consistency of developed or commercial software.

This approach provides new insights into the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying confinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a relativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective confinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS space. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron spectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods described here give a precise interpretation of holographic variables and quantities in AdS space in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This leads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant light-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound-states in physical space-time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the excitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states lie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and orbital quantum numbers. In the light-front holographic approach described here currents are expressed as an infinite sum of poles, and form factors as a product of poles. At large q2 the form factor incorporates the correct power-law fall-off for hard scattering independent of the specific dynamics and is dictated by the twist. At low q2 the form factor leads to vector dominance. The approach is also extended to include small quark masses. We briefly review in this report other holographic approaches to QCD, in particular top-down and bottom-up models based on chiral symmetry breaking. We also include a discussion of open problems and future applications.",

The model creature is self-propelled; it follows a path determined by the forces acting upon it, as generated by its prescribed changing shape. The numerical solution has been obtained by applying coordinate transformations and then using finite difference methods. Results are presented showing the flow around the creature as it accelerates from rest in an enclosed tank. The kinematics and dynamics associated with the creature&#039;s centre of mass are also shown. For a particular set of body shape parameters, the final mean swimming speed is found to be 0.77 times the speed of the backward-travelling wave. The corresponding movement amplitude envelope is shown. The magnitude of oscillation in the net forward force has been shown to be approximately twice that in the lateral force. The importance of allowing for acceleration and deceleration of the creature&#039;s body (rather than imposing a constant swimming speed) has been demonstrated. The calculations of rotational movement of the body and the associated moment of forces about the centre of mass have also been included in the model. The important role of viscous forces along and around the creature&#039;s body and in the growth and dissolution of the vortex structures has been illustrated",

The methods use Krylov subspaces constructed by the Arnoldi process from actions of the explicit Navier-Stokes right-hand side and of its Jacobian, without inversion of the viscous operator. Time evolution is performed by a nonlinear extension of the method of exponential propagation. Steady states are calculated by inexact Krylov-Newton iteration using ORTHORES and GMRES. Linear stability analysis is carried out using an implicitly restarted Arnoldi process with implicit polynomial filters.

The incompressibility constraint is enforced for each Runge-Kutta stage iteratively either by local pressure correction or by a Poisson-equation based global pressure correction method. Local pressure correction is carried out on cell by cell basis using a local, fourth-order accurate discrete analog of the continuity equation. The global pressure correction is based on the numerical solution of a Poisson-type equation which is discretized to fourth-order accuracy, and solved using GMRES. In both cases, the updated pressure is used to recompute the velocities in order to satisfy the incompressibility constraint to fourth-order accuracy.

The procedure to enforce the no-slip condition is based on a velocity-dependent shear force, which is a generalized force to represent the presence of the solid-wall particles and to maintain locally thermodynamic consistency. We show that this method can be implemented in both steady and time-dependent fluid systems and compare the DPD results with the continuum limit (Navier-Stokes) results. We also develop a force-adaptive method to impose the outflow boundary conditions for fully developed flow with unspecified outflow velocity profile or pressure value. We study flows over the backward-facing step and in idealized arterial bifurcations using a combination of the two new boundary methods with different flow rates. Finally, we explore the applicability of the outflow method in time-dependent flow systems. The outflow boundary method works well for systems with Womersley number of O(1), i.e. when the pressure and flowrate at the outflow are approximately in-phase. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "We investigate the derivation of Euler’s equation from Hamilton’s variational principle for flows decomposed into their mean and fluctuating parts. Our particular concern is with the flow decomposition used in the derivation of the Navier–Stokes–$\alpha$ equation which expresses the fluctuating velocity in terms of the mean flow and a small fluctuating displacement. In the past the derivation has retained terms up to second order in the Lagrangian which is then averaged. The variation is effected by incrementing the mean velocity, while holding the moments of the products of the displacements fixed. The process leads to a mean Euler equation for the mean velocity. The Navier–Stokes–$\alpha$ equation is only obtained after making a further closure approximation, which is not the concern of this paper. Instead attention is restricted here to the exact analysis of Euler’s equation. We show that a proper implementation of Hamilton’s principle, which concerns the virtual variation of particle paths, can only be achieved when the fluctuating displacement and mean velocity are varied in concert. This leads to an exact form of Euler’s equation. If, on the other hand, the displacement is held fixed under the variation, a term in Euler’s equation is lost. Averaging that erroneous form provides the basis of the Navier–Stokes–$\alpha$ equation. We explore the implications of the correct mean equation, particularly with regard to Kelvin’s circulation theorem, comparing it with the so called GLM and glm-equations.",

It has been found that the dilatation rate contribution to the FSD transport strengthens with increasing value of ?? and decreasing value of Le. The behaviour of the normal strain rate term shows significant differences in response to Da and Le. It has been found that the normal strain rate contribution to the FSD transport remains a sink term for the flames with high and small values of Da and Le, respectively, where the effects of strain rate induced by heat release achem overcome the effects of turbulent straining aturb. By contrast, the effects of aturb overcomes the effects of achem for low Da flames with Le???1, which leads to a positive value of the normal strain rate term towards the unburned gas side, but this term becomes negative towards the burned gas side due to strong achem overcoming aturb in the regions of intense heat release. The strengthening of the dilatation rate and achem at small and large values of Le and Da, respectively, is explicitly taken into account to propose new models for the strain rate contributions to the FSD transport. The new model is shown to satisfactorily capture the effects of Damk??hler number Da, heat release parameter ??, and global Lewis number Le, on the tangential strain rate term of the FSD transport equation for all the cases considered in this study. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

          "abstract": "We present a new finite-difference numerical method to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using a collocated discretization in space on a logically Cartesian grid. The method shares some common aspects with, and it was inspired by, the Box scheme. It uses centered second-order-accurate finite-difference approximations for the spatial derivatives combined with semi-implicit time integration. The proposed method is constructed to ensure discrete conservation of mass and momentum by discretizing the primitive velocity-pressure form of the equations. The continuity equation is enforced exactly (to machine accuracy) at the collocated locations, whereas the momentum equations are evaluated in a staggered manner. This formulation preempts the appearance of spurious pressure modes in the embedded elliptic problem associated with the pressure. The method shows uniform order of accuracy, both in space and time, for velocity and pressure. In addition, the skew-symmetric form of the non-linear advection term of the Navier-Stokes equations improves discrete conservation of kinetic energy in the inviscid limit, to within the order of the truncation error of the time integrator. The method has been formulated to accommodate different types of boundary conditions; fully periodic, periodic channel, inflow-outflow and lid-driven cavity; always ensuring global mass conservation. A novel aspect of this finite-difference formulation is the derivation of the discretization near boundaries using the weak form of the equations, as in the finite element method. The method of manufactured solutions is utilized to perform accuracy analysis and verification of the solver. To assess the applicability of the new method presented in this paper, four realistic flow problems have been simulated and results are compared with those in the literature. These cases include a lid-driven cavity, backward-facing step, Kovasznay flow, and fully developed turbulent channel. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

This procedure ensures a consistent order of accuracy control over the nonequilibrium contributions in the Galerkin sense. Using this formulation, we construct a specific lattice Boltzmann model that accurately incorporates up to third-order hydrodynamic moments.

The thickness of the interface between the two bulk fluids and the mobility are the main parameters of the model. For real fluids they are usually too small to be directly used in numerical simulations. Several authors proposed criteria for the proper choice of interface thickness and mobility in order to reach the so-called ‘sharp-interface limit’. In this paper the problem is approached by a formal asymptotic expansion of the governing equations. It is shown that the mobility is an effective parameter to be chosen proportional to the square of the interface thickness. The theoretical results are confirmed by numerical simulations for two prototypal flows, namely capillary waves riding the interface and droplets coalescence. The numerical analysis of two different physical problems confirms the theoretical findings and establishes an optimal relationship between the effective parameters of the model.",

The local projection allows to circumvent the Babuska-Brezzi condition by using equal-order finite element pairs. The local projection can be used to stabilize high equal-order finite element pairs. The proposed method combines the local projection stabilization method and the two-level method under the assumption of the uniqueness condition. The two-level method consists of solving a nonlinear equation on the coarse mesh and solving a linear equation on fine mesh. The nonlinear equation is solved by the one-step Newtonian iteration method. In the rest of this article, we show the error analysis of the lowest equal-order finite element pair and provide convergence rate of approximate solutions. Furthermore, the numerical illustrations coincide with the theoretical analysis expectations. From the view of computational time, the results show that the two-level method is effective to solve the stationary Navier-Stokes equations. {Â}{\copyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

          "abstract": "This paper details an exact two-equation procedure to generate pressure, temperature and mass and mole fractions as well as their thermodynamic and Jacobian partial derivatives for five-species neutral equilibrium air. Applicable for arbitrary forms of equilibrium constants and especially designed for explicit and implicit CFD algorithms, the procedure algebraically reduces to two equations the six-equation thermodynamic system comprising the equations for internal energy, law of mass action and conservation of species mass and ratio of oxygen and nitrogen nuclei. This exact algebraic reduction explicitly expresses four mass fractions in terms of nitric oxide mass fraction and temperature, which are then determined through a rapidly converging numerical solution of the internal energy and nitric oxide mass action equations. The procedure then exactly determines the partial derivatives of pressure, temperature and mass fractions analytically. The mathematical formulation also introduces a convenient system non-dimensionalization that makes the procedure uniformly applicable to flows ranging from shock tube flows with zero initial velocity to aerothermodynamic flows with supersonic/hypersonic freestream Mach numbers. Over a wide range of density and internal energy the predicted distributions of mole fractions for the model five species agree with independent published results, while pressure and temperature as well as their partial derivatives remain continuous, smooth and physically meaningful. © 1997 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

          "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the implementation of spatially discrete versions of Chorin-Temam&#039;s projection methods. The emphasis is put on the projection step, which enforces incompressibility. Three types of variational approximations are reviewed. In the first one, the projection step is solved as a div-grad problem with velocity test functions satisfying (at first glance) a paradoxical Dirichlet condition. In the second method, the projection step is still solved as a div-grad problem but the velocity test functions satisfy a boundary condition only for the normal component. In the third approach the projection step is solved in the form of a Poisson equation supplemented with a Neumann boundary condition. The first method is shown to be legitimate and economical for finite element approximations, whereas the second one is shown to be useful for spectral approximations. The third one is probably the easiest to implement since it avoids the problem of the mass matrix occurring in the two others. Though the second and third approaches do not directly involve a inf-sup condition, this condition is pointed out to be necessary to establish convergence and rule out possible spurious pressure. Finally some links between these algorithms and some preconditioning techniques of the Uzawa operator are shown.",

The method is based on a finite-volume formulation and uses the pressure in the cell center and the mass fluxes across the faces of each cell as dependent variables. Implicit treatment of convective and viscous terms in the momentum equations enables the numerical stability restrictions to be relaxed. The linearization error in the implicit solution of momentum equations is reduced by using three subiterations in order to achieve second order temporal accuracy for time-accurate calculations. In spatial discretizations of the momentum equations, a high-order (third and fifth) flux-difference splitting for the convective terms and a second-order central difference for the viscous terms are used. The resulting algebraic equations are solved with a line-relaxation scheme which allows the use of large time step. A four color ZEBRA scheme is employed after the line-relaxation procedure in the solution of the Poisson equation for pressure. This procedure is applied to a Couette flow problem using a distorted computational grid to show that the method minimizes grid effects. Additional benchmark cases include the unsteady laminar flow over a circular cylinder for Reynolds numbers of 200, and a 3-D, steady, turbulent wingtip vortex wake propagation study. The solution algorithm does a very good job in resolving the vortex core when fifth-order upwind differencing and a modified production term in the Baldwin–Barth one-equation turbulence model are used with adequate grid resolution.",

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust and efficient numerical method for the simulation of low Mach number flows in which the poorly distributed eigenvalues usually result in the numerical difficulties. The method takes advantage of the pressure-based and the density-based methods. It thus accelerates the numerical convergence by adjusting the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. In order to control the numerical instability and the spurious wave reflections at the numerical boundaries, a characteristic boundary condition is formulated. This numerical method as well as the boundary condition treatment extend the traditional fractional step method to the simulation of compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The performance and the accuracy of the method to calculate the flows with large amplitude of acoustic waves and strong heat transfer have been demonstrated by the direct numerical simulation of three distinct cases: a one-dimensional Euler equation with large amplitude of acoustic waves, an adiabatic turbulent boundary layer, and a turbulent boundary layer with heated wall. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "The study on fluid flow and transport processes of rock fractures in most practical applications involves two fundamental issues: the validity of Reynolds equation for fluid flow (as most often assumed) and the effects of shear displacements on the magnitudes and anisotropy of the fluid flow velocity field. The reason for such concerns is that the impact of the surface roughness of rock fractures is still an unresolved challenging issue. The later has been systematically investigated with results showing that shear displacement plays a dominant role on evolutions of fluid velocity fields, for both magnitudes and anisotropy, but the former has not received examinations in details due to the numerical complexities involving solution of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and the representations of fracture geometry during shear. The objective of this paper aims to solve this problem through a FEM modeling effort. Applying the COMSOL Multiphysics code (FEM) and assuming a 2D problem, we consider the coupled hydromechanical effect of fracture geometry change due to shear on fluid flow (velocity patterns) and particle transport (streamline/velocity dispersion), using measured topographical data of natural rock fracture surfaces. The fluid flow in the vertical 2D cross-sections of single rock fractures was simulated by solving both the Navier-Stokes and the Reynolds equation, and the particle transport was predicted by the streamline particle tracking method with calculated flow velocity fields (vectors) from the flow simulations, obtaining results such as flow velocity profiles, total flow rates, particle travel time, breakthrough curves and the Péclet number, Pe, respectively. The results obtained using NS and Reynolds equations were compared to illustrate the degree of the validity of the Reynolds equation for general applications in practice since the later is mush more computationally efficient for solving large-scale problems. The flow simulation results show that both the total flow rate and the flow velocity fields in a rough rock fracture predicted by the NS equation were quite different from those predicted by the Reynolds equation. The results show that a roughly 5-10% overestimation on the flow rate is produced when the Reynolds equation is used, and the ideal parabolic velocity profiles defined by the local cubic law, when Reynolds equation is used, is no longer valid, especially when the roughness feature of the fracture surfaces changes with shear. These deviations of flow rate and flow velocity profiles across the fracture aperture have a significant impact on the particle transport behavior and the associated properties, such as the travel time and Péclet number. The deviations increase with increasing flow velocity and become more significant when fracture aperture geometry changes with shear. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "We consider the inverse problem of estimating the initial condition of a partial differential equation, which is only observed through noisy measurements at discrete time intervals. In particular, we focus on the case where Eulerian measurements are obtained from the time and space evolving vector field, whose evolution obeys the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations defined on a torus. This context is particularly relevant to the area of numerical weather forecasting and data assimilation. We will adopt a Bayesian formulation resulting from a particular regularization that ensures the problem is well posed. In the context of Monte Carlo based inference, it is a challenging task to obtain samples from the resulting high dimensional posterior on the initial condition. In real data assimilation applications it is common for computational methods to invoke the use of heuristics and Gaussian approximations. As a result, the resulting inferences are biased and not well-justified in the presence of non-linear dynamics and observations. On the other hand, Monte Carlo methods can be used to assimilate data in a principled manner, but are often perceived as inefficient in this context due to the high-dimensionality of the problem. In this work we will propose a generic Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling approach for high dimensional inverse problems that overcomes these difficulties. The method builds upon “state of the art” Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which are currently considered as benchmarks for evaluating data assimilation algorithms used in practice. SMC samplers can improve in terms of efficiency as they possess greater flexibility and one can include steps like sequential tempering, adaptation and parallelization with rela- tively low amount of extra computations. We will illustrate this using numerical examples, where our proposed SMC approach can achieve the same accuracy as MCMC but in a much more efficient manner.",

The primitive variable formulation uses the pressure, defined at the center of the computational cell, and the volume fluxes across the faces of the cells as the dependent variables, instead of the Cartesian components of the velocity. This choice is equivalent to using the contravariant velocity components in a staggered grid multiplied by the volume of the computational cell. The governing equations are discretized by finite volumes using a staggered mesh system. The solution of the continuity equation is decoupled from the momentum equations by a fractional step method which enforces mass conservation by solving a Poisson equation. This procedure, combined with a consistent approximation of the geometric quantities, is done to satisfy the discretized mass conservation equation to machine accuracy, as well as to gain the favorable convergence properties of the Poisson solver. The momentum equations are solved by an approximate factorization method, and a novel ZEBRA scheme with four-color ordering is devised for the efficient solution of the Poisson equation.

Some hardware implementations of microarray image processing have been proposed and proved to be a promising alternative to the currently available software systems. However, the main drawback is the unsuitable addressing of the quantification of the gene spots which depend on many assumptions. It is our aim in this paper to present a new Image Reconstruction algorithm using Cellular Neural Network, which solves the Navier-Stokes equation. This algorithm offers a robust method to estimate the background signal within the gene spot region. Quantitative comparisons are carried out, between our approach and some available methods in terms of objective standpoint. It is shown that the proposed algorithm gives highly accurate and realistic measurements in a fully automated manner, and also, in a remarkably efficient time.",

The catheter measurement is generally considered more accurate, but the procedure is also more likely to have dangerous complications.\n\nOBJECTIVE: The focus here is on examining computational fluid dynamics as an alternative method for analyzing the echo data and determining whether it can provide results similar to the catheter measurement.\n\nMETHODS: An in vitro heart model with a rigid orifice is used as a first step in comparing echocardiographic data, which uses the simplified Bernoulli equation, catheterization, and echocardiographic data, which uses computational fluid dynamics (i.e., the Navier-Stokes equations).\n\nRESULTS: For a 0.93cm(2) orifice, the maximum pressure gradient predicted by either the simplified Bernoulli equation or computational fluid dynamics was not significantly different from the experimental catheter measurement (p &gt; 0.01). For a smaller 0.52cm(2) orifice, there was a small but significant difference (p &lt; 0.01) between the simplified Bernoulli equation and the computational fluid dynamics simulation, with the computational fluid dynamics simulation giving better agreement with experimental data for some turbulence models.\n\nCONCLUSION: For this simplified, in vitro system, the use of computational fluid dynamics provides an improvement over the simplified Bernoulli equation with the biggest improvement being seen at higher valvular stenosis levels.",

The present paper derives the complete contravariant form of the Navier-Stokes equations in a time-dependent curvilinear coordinate system from the intrinsic derivative of contravariant vectors in a moving frame. The result is verified via direct transformation. These complete equations are then applied to compute incompressible flow in a 2D channel with prescribed boundary motion, and the significant effect of some terms which are sometimes either overlooked or assumed to be negligible in such a derivation is quantified. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

To study the interaction of design variables, the flow behaviour needs to be considered, especially when modelling the new three-product cyclone. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the three-product cyclone, in particular the influence of the dual vortex finder arrangement on flow behaviour. From experimental work performed on the UG2 platinum ore, significant differences in the classification performance of the three-product cyclone were noticed with variations in the inner vortex finder length. Because of this simulations were performed for a range of inner vortex finder lengths. Simulations were also conducted on a conventional hydrocyclone of the same size to enable a direct comparison of the flow behaviour between the two cyclone designs. Significantly, high velocities were observed for the three-product cyclone with an inner vortex finder extended deep into the conical section of the cyclone. CFD studies revealed that in the three-product cyclone, a cylindrical shaped air-core is observed similar to conventional hydrocyclones. A constant diameter air-core was observed throughout the inner vortex finder length, while no air-core was present in the annulus.",

The technique is presented through application to the particular problem of describing thermal convection in a rotating annulus. The equations, in cylindrical polar co-ordinate form, are integrated with respect to time by a marching process, together with the solving of a Poisson equation for the pressure. A suitable form of the finite difference equations gives a computationally-stable long-term integration with reasonably faithful representation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow.Trigonometric interpolation techniques provide accurate (discretely exact) solutions to the Poisson equation. By using an auxiliary algorithm for rapid evaluation of trigonometric transforms, the proportion of computation needed to solve the Poisson equation can be reduced to less than 25% of the total time needed to advance one time step. Computing on a UNIVAC 1108 machine, the flow can be advanced one time-step in 2 sec for a 14 times 14 times 14 grid upward to 96 sec for a 60 times 34 times 34 grid.

In the present work, two models for the solutes dynamics are investigated. In the first model, which is essentially based on the one introduced by Rappitsch and Perktold [J. Biomech. Engrg., 118 (1996), pp. 511--519] and Rappitsch, Perktold, and Pernkopf [Internat. J. Numer. Methods Fluids, 25 (1997), pp. 847--857], the Navier--Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid, describing the blood velocity and pressure fields, are coupled with an advection-diffusion equation for the solute concentration. The wellposedness of this model is discussed. The second model considers also the solutes dynamics &quot;inside&quot; the arterial wall, described by a pure diffusion equation. Actually, this is a heterogeneous model, coupling different equations in different parts of the domain at hand. Its wellposedness is proven. Moreover, in view of the numerical study, an iterative finite element method by subdomains is proposed and its convergence properties are analyzed. Finally, several numerical results comparing the different models in situations of physiologic interest are illustrated.",

In this paper, we consider the problem of drag minimization for a body in relative motion in a fluid by controlling the velocity through the body boundary. With this aim, we handle with an optimal control approach applied to the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We use the Lagrangian functional approach and we consider the Lagrangian multiplier method for the treatment of the Dirichlet boundary conditions, which include the control function itself. Moreover, we express the drag coefficient, which is the functional to be minimized, through the variational form of the Navier-Stokes equations. In this way, we can derive, in a straightforward manner, the adjoint and sensitivity equations associated with the optimal control problem, even in the presence of Dirichlet control functions. The problem is solved numerically by an iterative optimization procedure applied to state and adjoint PDEs which we approximate by the finite element method.

The algorithms operate on a nodal basis, where the finite element information is stored as the co-ordinates of the nodes and the nodes in each element. Temporary storage is needed, such as the search vectors correction vectors and right hand side vectors in the conjugate gradient algorithms which are limited to one-dimensional vectors. The nodal solution algorithms consist of splitting the Navier-Stokes equations into equation systems which are solved sequencially. In the pressure split algorithm, the velocities are found from the diffusion-convection equation and the pressure is computed from these velocities. The computed velocities are then corrected with the pressure gradient. In the velocity-pressure split algorithm, a velocity approximation is first found from the diffusion equation. This velocity is corrected by solving the convection equation. The pressure is then found from these velocities. Finally, the velocities are corrected by the pressure gradient. The nodal algorithms are compared by solving the original Navier-Stokes equations. The pressure split and velocity-pressure split equation systems are solved using ILU preconditioned conjugate gradient methods where the equation matrices are stored, and by using diagonal preconditioned conjugate gradient methods without storing the equation matrices. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

These include physics-based methods, such as SIMPLE, and purely algebraic preconditioners based on the approximation of the Schur complement. All these techniques can be represented as approximate block factorization (ABF) type preconditioners. The goal is to decompose the application of the preconditioner into simplified sub-systems in which scalable multi-level type solvers can be applied. In this paper we develop a taxonomy of these ideas based on an adaptation of a generalized approximate factorization of the Navier-Stokes system first presented in [A. Quarteroni, F. Saleri, A. Veneziani, Factorization methods for the numerical approximation of Navier-Stokes equations, Computational Methods in Applied Mechanical Engineering 188 (2000) 505-526]. This taxonomy illuminates the similarities and differences among these preconditioners and the central role played by efficient approximation of certain Schur complement operators. We then present a parallel computational study that examines the performance of these methods and compares them to an additive Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) algorithm. Results are presented for two and three-dimensional steady state problems for enclosed domains and inflow/outflow systems on both structured and unstructured meshes.

Three steady, one-dimensional ME flow models, incorporating different methods of flow separation point prediction, were compared. For two models, determination of the flow separation point was based on fixed ratios of the glottal area at separation to the minimum glottal area; for the third model, the separation point determination was based on fluid mechanics boundary layer theory. Results of flow rate, separation point, and intraglottal pressure distribution were compared with those of an unsteady, two-dimensional, finite element Navier-Stokes model. Cases were considered with a rigid glottal profile as well as with a vibrating vocal fold. For small glottal widths, the three ME flow models yielded good predictions of flow rate and intraglottal pressure distribution, but poor predictions of separation location. For larger orifice widths, the ME models were poor predictors of flow rate and intraglottal pressure, but they satisfactorily predicted separation location. For the vibrating vocal fold case, all models resulted in similar predictions of mean intraglottal pressure, maximum orifice area, and vibration frequency, but vastly different predictions of separation location and maximum flow rate. ?? 2007 The Voice Foundation.",

          "abstract": "A Navier-Stokes fluid is defined to be an isotropic, non-micromorph material for which a linear relation between the viscous pressure tensor and the stretching holds in every theoretical flow situation. However, as to the dynamical representation of this fluid&#039;s state quantities, the conservation law of angular momentum is generally ignored. The paper deals with the impact of this principle on the mathematical structure of the ordinary Navier-Stokes equation of motion. It is known that the physics of fluids is strongly influenced by the form of the dissipation law which is assumed to be valid. Obviously, most of the real flow patterns cannot be described adequately by this fluid model unless the well-known paradoxes of the equation&#039;s solutions are accepted in practice. This is especially true for incompressible flows. Thus, severe consequences for the vorticity equation are inevitable; particularly, the theory of turbulent flows is strongly affected. Hence, engineering work is considerably influenced. Why these fundamental conclusions are widely disregarded in research and education is discussed. The inadequate behavior is mainly caused by the traditional viewpoint of classical mechanics which is founded on incomplete conservation laws. A realistic flow field description, however, may be established by means of non-equilibrium concepts for the stress rate quantities. A respective new theory of thermofluid dynamics is briefly summarized. It allows the elimination of some serious inconsistencies which are inherent in the present state of the Navier-Stokes theory. ?? 1994.",

Then we establish the well-posedness of the unsteady Stokes equations and employ the solution to reduce our initial-boundary value problem into an initial-boundary value problem with absolute boundary conditions. Based on this, we first establish the well-posedness for an appropriate local linearized problem with the absolute boundary conditions and the initial condition (without the incompressibility condition), which establishes a velocity mapping. Then we develop apriori estimates for the velocity mapping, especially involving the Sobolev norm for the time-derivative of the mapping to deal with the complicated boundary conditions, which leads to the existence of the fixed point of the mapping and the existence of solutions to our initial-boundary value problem. Finally, we establish that, when the viscosity coefficient tends zero, the strong solutions of the initial-boundary value problem in ℝn(n ≥ 3) with nonhomogeneous vorticity boundary condition converge in L2 to the corresponding Euler equations satisfying the kinematic condition. © 2009 Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics.",

Different from existing thermal lattice Boltzmann methods, this method can recover the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a flexible specific-heat ratio and Prandtl number. In the method, a density distribution function based on a multispeed lattice is used to recover the compressible continuity and momentum equations, while the compressible energy equation is recovered by an energy distribution function. The energy distribution function is then coupled to the density distribution function via the thermal equation of state. In order to obtain an adjustable specific-heat ratio, a constant related to the specific-heat ratio is introduced into the equilibrium energy distribution function. Two different coupled double-distribution-function lattice Boltzmann models are also proposed in the paper. Numerical simulations are performed for the Riemann problem, the double-Mach-reflection problem, and the Couette flow with a range of specific-heat ratios and Prandtl numbers. The numerical results are found to be in excellent agreement with analytical and/or other solutions.",

          "abstract": "We present a continuum-mechanical formulation and generalization of the Navier-Stokes alpha theory based on a general framework for fluid-dynamical theories with gradient dependencies. Our flow equation involves two additional problem-dependent length scales alpha and beta. The first of these scales enters the theory through the internal kinetic energy, per unit mass, alpha(2)parallel to D parallel to(2), where D is the symmetric part of the gradient of the filtered velocity. The remaining scale is associated with a dissipative hyperstress which depends linearly on the gradient of the filtered vorticity. When alpha and beta are equal, our flow equation reduces to the Navier-Stokes alpha equation. In contrast to the original derivation of the Navier-Stokes alpha equation, which relies on Lagrangian averaging, our formulation delivers boundary conditions. For a confined flow, our boundary conditions involve an additional length scale l characteristic of the eddies found near walls. Based on a comparison with direct numerical simulations for fully developed turbulent flow in a rectangular channel of height 2h, we find that alpha/beta similar to Re-0.470 and l/h similar to Re-0.772, where Re is the Reynolds number. The first result, which arises as a consequence of identifying the internal kinetic energy with the turbulent kinetic energy, indicates that the choice alpha=beta required to reduce our flow equation to the Navier-Stokes alpha equation is likely to be problematic. The second result evinces the classical scaling relation eta/L similar to Re-3/4 for the ratio of the Kolmogorov microscale eta to the integral length scale L. The numerical data also suggests that l &lt;=beta. We are therefore led to conjecture a tentative hierarchy, l &lt;=beta &lt;alpha, involving the three length scales entering our theory.",

In this work, we first show that the most common implementation of the VANS equations in the LBM, based on a redefined collision operator, is not valid in the case of spatially varying void fractions. This is illustrated through five test cases designed using the so-called method of manufactured solutions. We then present an LBM scheme for these equations based on a novel collision operator.

The definition of the adjoint as\nthe sensitivity of an output to residual source perturbations is used to\nderive both the adjoint equation, in fully discrete and variational\nformulations, and the adjoint-weighted residual method for error\nestimation. Assumptions and approximations made in the calculations are\ndiscussed. Presentation of the discrete and variational formulations\nenables a side-by-side comparison of recent work in output-error\nestimation using the finite volume method and the finite element method.\nTechniques for adapting meshes using output-error indicators are also\nreviewed. Recent adaptive results from a variety of laminar and\nReynolds-averaged Navier Stokes applications show the power of\noutput-based adaptive methods for improving the robustness of\ncomputational fluid dynamics computations. However, challenges and areas\nof additional future research remain, including computable error bounds\nand robust mesh adaptation mechanics.",

The code was validated by comparing computed results with the experimental data obtained in cylindrical-port cold-flow tests. The agreement between the computed and experimentally measured mean axial velocities is excellent. The axial location of transition to turbulent flow predicted by the two-equation (k-epsilon) turbulence model used in the computations also agrees well with the experimental data. Computations performed to simulate the axisymmetric flowfield in the vicinity of the aft field joint in the Space Shuttle solid rocket motor using 14,725 grid points show the presence of a region of reversed axial flow near the downstream edge of the slot.",

We begin with a description of fluids within the framework of a continuum. We then discuss We begin with a description of fluids within the framework of a continuum. We then discuss various ways in which the response of a fluid can depart from that of a Navier-Stokes fluid. Next, we introduce a general thermodynamic framework that has been successful in describing the disparate response of continua that includes those of inelasticity, solid-to-solid transformation, viscoelasticity, granular materials, blood and asphalt rheology, etc. Here, it leads to a novel derivation of the constitutive equation for the Cauchy stress for fluids with constant, or shear and/or pressure, or density dependent viscosity within a full thermomechanical setting. One advantage of this approach consists in a transparent treatment of the constraint of incompressibility. We then concentrate on the mathematical analysis of three-dimensional unsteady flows of fluids with shear dependent viscosity that includes the Navier-Stokes model and Ladyzhenskaya&#039;s model as special cases. We are interested in the issues connected with mathematical self-consistency of the models, i.e., we are interested in knowing whether (1) flows exist for reasonable, but arbitrary initial data and all instants of time, (2) flows are uniquely determined, (3) the velocity is bounded and (4) the long-time behavior of all possible flows can be captured by a finite-dimensional, small (compact) set attracting all flow trajectories exponentially. For simplicity, we eliminate the choice of boundary conditions and their influence on the flows by assuming that all functions are spatially periodic with zero mean value over a periodic cell. All these results can however be extended to internal flows wherein the tangential component of the velocity satisfies Navier&#039;s slip at the boundary. Most of the results also hold for the no-slip boundary condition. While the mathematical consistency understood in the above sense for the Navier-Stokes model in three dimensions has not been established as yet, we will show that Ladyzhenskaya&#039;s model and some of its generalization enjoy all above characteristics for a certain range of parameters. We also discuss briefly further results related to generalizations of the Navier-Stokes equations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Using nonrelativistic long-wavelength expansion, we obtain the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of dual fluid with external force density on the finite cutoff surface. The viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ is independent of cutoff surface and does not get modification from the third order Lovelock gravity influence. The obtained ratio agrees with the results obtained by using other methods, such as the Kubo formula at the AdS boundary and the membrane paradigm at the horizon in the third order Lovelock gravity. These results can be related by Wilson renormalization group flow. However the kinematic viscosity receives correction from the third order Lovelock term. We show that the equivalence between the isentropic flow of the fluid and the radial component of the gravitational equation observed in the Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravities also holds in the third order Lovelock gravity. This generalization brings more understandings of relating the gravity theory to the dual fluid.",

However, the main drawback of those proposed approaches is the unsuitable addressing of the quantification of the gene spot in a realistic way without any assumption about the image surface.

Quantitative comparisons are carried out, in terms of objective criteria, between our approach and some other methods such as Bertalmio’s method [5], CNNIR algorithm [30] and median background estimation (which is widely used in available packages such as GenePix, ScanAlyze and ImaGene).

The reliability of the µ(I)-rheology in the case of complex transient flows is not fully ascertained, however. From this perspective, the granular column collapse experiment provides an interesting benchmark. In this paper we implement the µ(I)-rheology in a Navier–Stokes solver (Gerris) and compare the resulting solutions with both analytical solutions and two-dimensional contact dynamics discrete simulations. In a first series of simulations, we check the numerical model in the case of a steady infinite two-dimensional granular layer avalanching on an inclined plane. A second layer of Newtonian fluid is then added over the granular layer in order to recover a close approximation of a free-surface condition. Comparisons with analytical and semi- analytical solutions provide conclusive validation of the numerical implementation of the µ(I)-rheology. In a second part, we simulate the unsteady two-dimensional collapse of granular columns over a wide range of aspect ratios. Systematic comparisons with discrete two-dimensional contact dynamics simulations show good agreement between the two methods for the inner deformations and the time evolution of the shape during most of the flow, while a systematic underestimation of the final run-out is observed. The experimental scalings of spreading of the column as a function of the aspect ratio available from the literature are also recovered. A discussion follows on the performances of other rheologies, and on the sensitivity of the simulations to the parameters of the µ(I)-rheology.",

The time integration schemes are first applied to two model problems, represented by a first order differential equation in time and the one dimensional advection-diffusion equation, and subjected to a detailed mathematical analysis based on the Fourier series expansion. In order to establish the accuracy and efficiency of the time integration schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations, a detailed computational study is performed of two standard numerical examples: unsteady flow around a cylinder and flow across a backward facing step.

          "abstract": "Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods have proved to be well suited for the construction of robust high-order numerical schemes on unstructured and possibly nonconforming grids for a variety of problems. Their application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations has also been recently considered, although the subject is far from being fully explored. In this work, we propose a new approach for the DG numerical solution of the INS equations written in conservation form. The inviscid numerical fluxes both in the continuity and in the momentum equation are computed using the values of velocity and pressure provided by the (exact) solution of the Riemann problem associated with a local artificial compressibility perturbation of the equations. Unlike in most of the existing methods, artificial compressibility is here introduced only at the interface flux level, therefore resulting in a consistent discretization of the INS equations irrespectively of the amount of artificial compressibility introduced. The discretization of the viscous term follows the well-established DG scheme named BR2. The performance and the accuracy of the method are demonstrated by computing the Kovasznay flow and the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and for various degrees of polynomial approximation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

          "abstract": "The material properties of heterogeneous polymer blends are crucially influenced by their morphology, i.e., by the spatial structure of the blend components and by the specific configuration of the interfaces separating the phases. Hence, in order to understand the behavior of experimentally obtained morphologies, one is interested in modeling the relevant dynamics of the morphology subject to external flow. Thus one can study, e.g., through the interfacial stress tensor the rheological properties due to the interfaces. The balance equations used for that purpose are based on a Cahn-Hilliard equation for the local concentration, the continuity equation, and a modified Navier-Stokes equation for the local velocity. The essential material and processing parameters such as surface tension, viscosity and volume fraction of both polymers, and imposed shear rate are taken into consideration as model coefficients. By regarding hydrodynamic interaction, which is proved to be important in case of immiscible blends, the interfacial relaxation is described properly. Simulations in both three and two dimensions agree at least qualitatively with experimental results concerning droplet deformation, droplet coalescene, and interfacial rheological properties of the blend.",

The edge-based data structure and assembly procedure adopted lead naturally to a strictly conservative discretization, which is valid for meshes composed of n-sided polygons. Particular attention is given to the construction of a pressure–velocity coupling procedure which is supported by edge data, resulting in a relatively simple numerical method that is consistent with the boundary and initial conditions required by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Edge formulas are presented for assembling the momentum equations, which are based on an upwind-biased linear reconstruction of the velocity field. Similar formulas are presented for assembling the pressure equation. The method is demonstrated to be second-order accurate in space and time for two Navier–Stokes problems admitting an exact solution. Results for several other well-known problems are also presented, including lid-driven cavity flow, impulsively started cylinder flow, and unsteady vortex shedding from a circular cylinder. Although the method is by construction minimalist, it is shown to be accurate and robust for the problems considered.",

Many of the difficulties encountered in the application of computational fluid dynamics to an open rotor engine arise due to the removal of the casing that is present in conventional aero-engine turbomachinery. In this work, an advanced three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver is applied to the open rotor. The approach needed to accurately capture the aerodynamics is investigated with particular attention to the mesh configuration and the specification of boundary conditions. A new three-step meshing strategy for generating the mesh and the most suitable type of far-field boundary condition are discussed. A control volume analysis approach is proposed for post-processing the numerical results for rotor performance. The capabilities of the solver and the applied methodology are demonstrated at both cruise and take-off operating conditions. The comparison of computational results with experimental measurements shows good agreement for both data trend and magnitudes.",
