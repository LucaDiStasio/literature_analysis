          "abstract": "The impedance of a rigid circular plate attached to the free surface of a semi-infinite elastic space or an elastic stratum is determined for its four degrees offreedom. The solution of the dual integral equations arising from tms mixed boundary-value problem is avoided by reference to Rayleigh&#039;s reciprocal theorem. This enables the functions of frequency, which determine the in-phase and out ofphase components of cI1splacerhent of the plate, to-be located between two close bounds and lying much closer to one than to the other. These bounds appear as infinite integrals involving branch functions and are reduced to tractable finite integrals by integration in the complex plane. Dissipation of waves to infinity produces an effective damping, and the added effect of the inclusion of true damping in the medium is discussed. It is to be expected, of course, that the unloaded rigid plate attached to the free surface of a semi-infinite elastic space does not resonate. The change of impedance of the plate with frequency is found to be similar for the&#039; two translations and also similar for the two rotations. Resonance occurs in the case of vertical and horizontal translation of the plate attached to the surface of an elastic stratum. However, it does not exist for rotations of the plate on the stratum. Instead, a maximum in the response appears,this maximum being more defined the greater the ratio of plate diameter to stratum depth. The addition of small true damping in the medium changes the characteristics very little. Experimental work substantiating these theoretical results, together with a general discussion of the results and their applications in geophysics and engineering, is being published shortly.",

Considering debond as an interface crack its growth in cyclic loading is analyzed utilizing a power law, where the debond growth rate is a power function of the change of the strain energy release rate in the cycle. To obtain values of two parameters in the power law cyclic loading of fragmented single fiber specimen is suggested. Measurements of the debond length increase with the number of load cycles in tension-tension fatigue are performed for glass fiber/epoxy single fiber composites.

The semi-infinite plate with roller-supported boundary is considered, and the image method is used to satisfy the boundary condition. The addition theorem for Bessel functions is employed to accomplish the translation of wave fields between different local coordinate systems. As an example, the numerical results of dynamic stress concentration factors around the inclusion are graphically presented and analyzed. Analysis shows that the angular distribution of the dynamic stress around the inclusion shows great difference when the distance between the inclusion and the semi-infinite edge is different. The effects of the elastic modulus, density, Poisson&#039;s ratio, and the thickness of the inclusion on the shadow side of the inclusion are greater when the distance between inclusion and the semi-infinite edge is small. In the region of lower frequency, the effects of the elastic modulus, density, Poisson&#039;s ratio, and the thickness of the inclusion on the dynamic stress are little.

          "abstract": "The effects of the split singularities, i.e. a stronger and a weaker singularity of a crack impinging at bimaterial interface on the competition between crack penetration and debond was recently investigated in [1] for the case of infinite isotropic bimaterial plane. Anisotropy usually lifts a degeneracy of the singularity exponents and strongly influences the direction of crack penetration across the interface. The concept of the Finite fracture mechanics introduced in [2,3-7], conservative line integral derived from Betti&#039;s reciprocal principle, and the matched asymptotic expansion method [3-7] are used to evaluate the energy release rate criteria describing the competition between the crack debond and penetration at a bimaterial interface between aligned orthotropic materials in edge cracked tension specimen. The effect of higher order terms on the crack penetration/debond at a bimaterial interface strongly depends on the elastic mismatch of dissimilar materials and on the crack-specimen configuration. For this reasons, a crack perpendicularly impinging the bimaterial interface and a crack arbitrary inclined to the interface are considered for a wide range of elastically mismatched materials. In the former case, the effect of the T-stress is investigated, in the latter case the combined effect of a weaker singularity and stronger singularity is examined for a range of crack/interface configurations. For the crack arbitrary inclined to the interface, FE solution of near-crack stress-displacement field obtained using a very fine mesh is compared with analytical singular field considering two leading terms of asymptotic expansion. As a side result it is found that the domain of singular field dominance for an arbitrary inclined crack increases with decreasing angle between the crack and the interface. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Based on the complex variable method of Muskhelishvili, closed-form solutions for the stresses and the displacements around the crack are obtained when general biaxial loads are applied at infinity. These solutions are then combined with A.A. Griffith&#039;s virtual work argument to give a criterion of crack extension, namely the de-bonding of the interface. The critical applied loads are expressed explicitly in terms of a function of the inclusion radius and the central angle subtended by the crack arc. In the case of simple tension the critical load is inversely proportional to the square-root of the inclusion radius. By analyzing the variation of the cleavage stress near the crack tip, the deviation of the crack into the matrix is discussed. The case of uniaxial tension is worked out in detail. ?? 1974.",

Composites with varying fiber-to-matrix moduli ratio (Ef/Em), sample lengths, interface bond strength, and processing residual stresses were tested to determine which composites would debond from the top and which from the bottom. The present pushout experiments combined with previous work in the literature indicate that only composites with an Ef/Em ratio greater than four tend to debond from the bottom during pushout testing, and debonding tends to initiate at the top of the interface when the Ef/Em ratio is less than three. The debond length as a function of force and displacement was also measured in a polariscope for two of the model composites - steel/epoxy and polyester/epoxy. The pushout data from a polyester/epoxy system that debonded from the top was fit to a shear lag solution of the fiber pushout problem to obtain the mode II toughness (GIIc) of the fiber-matrix interface. The resulting interface toughness was then used to check the predicted debond length as a function of pushout force. The debond length calculated from the shear lag model was less than the measured debond length by a nearly constant 1.5 fiber radii. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Comparison with the Hamaker expression for nonretarded van der Waals interaction reveals that the new technique gives the exact interaction energy between a spherical particle and a flat plate. Available analytical expressions for the electrostatic double layer interaction energy between two infinite flat plates, based on the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation, are used in SEI to obtain the sphere–flat plate interaction energy. These sphere–flat plate interaction energies determined using SEI are compared with the corresponding interaction energies obtained from a detailed numerical solution of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation based on finite element analysis. The comparisons reveal that SEI scales the flat plate interaction to the corresponding sphere–flat plate geometry exactly, while the scaling based on the conventional Derjaguin approximation technique grossly overpredicts the interaction energy for small particles and low electrolyte concentrations.",

An analytical equation for the passive plate deflection is derived upon this assumption. The analytical result shows excellent agreement with experimental data as well as the results from finite element simulation. Based on this analytical model, the effects of several important parameters and nondimensional variable groups on the actuator performance have been investigated.

          "abstract": "The plane strain problem of a single circular cylindrical inclusion embedded in an unbounded matrix subjected to a remote uniform uniaxial transverse tension is studied. A theoretical model for the simultaneous prediction of the initial size of a crack originated at the inclusion/matrix interface (or equivalently the initial polar angle of this crack) and of the critical remote tension required to originate this crack is developed. Isotropic and linear elastic behaviour of both materials, with the inclusion being stiffer than the matrix, is assumed. The interface is considered to be strong (providing continuity of displacements and tractions across the interface surface) and brittle. The model developed is based on the classical analytic solutions for the above-mentioned inclusion problem without and with a crack situated at the inclusion/matrix interface and a recently introduced coupled stress and energy criterion of failure by Leguillon [Eur. J. Mech. A/Solids 21 (2002) 61-72]. A new dimensionless structural parameter γ, depending on bimaterial and interface properties together with the inclusion radius a, which plays a key role in characterizing the interface crack onset, is introduced. Asymptotic behaviour of the predicted critical remote tension and the interface crack length/polar angle at the onset are characterized for small and large values of γ and a. A size effect inherent to this problem is predicted and analysed. The following asymptotic characteristics of this size effect are noteworthy: (i) for small inclusion radii a, the polar angle of the crack at onset is constant (independent of a), whereas the critical remote tension increases with decreasing a, being inversely proportional to the square root of a; (ii) for large inclusion radii a, the length of the crack at onset and the critical remote tension are approximately constant. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The creep-fatigue interaction and fatigue crack growth after debonding initiation are incorporated into a nonlinear an interfacial constitutive law to describe fatigue bond performance of FRP-concrete interface. While the creep-fatigue interaction is represented by the degradation of the interfacial stiffness, the debond growth is governed by a form of Paris equation and the fracture energy ratio, Gmax. /Gc. Furthermore, a new form of energy ratio is adopted to be debond-dependent. An experimental program using double-lap shear specimens was conducted to obtain debond growth rate and fatigue life of specimens. The debond growth along FRP-concrete interface was monitored using strain gauges attached on FRP sheets. All tests were carried out under ambient conditions with the maximum load ratio, Smax, varied from 30% to 80% and the minimum load ratio kept constant at 10% with frequency 5Hz. The agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results is valid with a good degree of accuracy.",

Natural frequencies are determined by the solution of the coupled electromechanical governing equations for a combination of free, soft simply supported, hard simply supported and clamped boundary conditions at the inner and outer edges of the plate. The electrodes on each piezoelectric layer are assumed to be short-circuited. The Maxwell electrostatics equation is satisfied by adopting a half-sine distribution of the electric potential in the transverse direction of the piezoelectric layers. A comparison of the present exact natural frequencies for piezoelectric coupled circular/annular plates with different boundary conditions is made with previously published results obtained by the Mindlin plate theory and 3-D modified finite element method. The effects of plate parameters such as host thickness to radius ratios, inner to outer radius ratios and piezoelectric to host thickness ratios on the natural frequencies of laminated circular/annular plates are investigated for different combinations of boundary conditions. Results obtained by the present exact closed-form solutions can be served as benchmark data for investigators to validate their numerical and analytical methods in the future. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An analytical solution for the stress field exhibits a square root singularity near the free edges. The associated stress intensity factor is calculated in closed form by an asymptotic analysis. For a given loading, the stress intensity factor decreases with increasing length-to-thickness ratio of the film, and with decreasing film-to-substrate stiffness ratio.

A rigorous solution to the interaction problem is derived in series form. As the time approaches infinity, our solution just recovers the classical one derived by Srolovitz et al.

In addition, we observe that the edge dislocation will induce a uniform rigid-body rotation in the inclusion as the time approaches infinity. When the dislocation is far away from the inclusion, simple asymptotic expressions of the glide and climb forces on the dislocation are also obtained. Furthermore, five extreme cases for the imperfect interface are discussed; in particular, we derive approximate closed-form expressions of the decaying internal stress field within the inclusion and the image force on the dislocation for long-range stress relaxations when the interface diffusion occurs much faster than the interface slip and vice versa. Some interesting physical behaviors are observed. ?? 2010 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We investigate the hydroelastic response of the plate to a plane incident wave for two cases of water depth. An analytic and numerical study is presented. An integro-differential equation is derived for the problem and an algorithm of its numerical solution is proposed. The representation of the solution as series of Bessel functions is the key idea of the approach. After a brief introduction and formulation of the problem, we derive the main integro-differential equation by the use of the thin plate theory and Green&#039;s theorem. The plate deflection, the free-surface elevation and the Green&#039;s function are expressed in cylindrical coordinates as series of Bessel functions. For the coefficients, a set of algebraic equations is obtained, yielding the approximate solution for the case of infinite water depth. Then a solution is obtained for the general case of finite water depth analogously. The exact solution is approximated by taking a finite number of roots of the dispersion relation into account. Numerical results for the plate deflection, initiated wave pattern and free-surface elevation are presented for various physical parameters of the problem, together with some remarks on the computation and discussion. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This procedure - the displacement discontinuity method - consists simply of placing N displacement discontinuities of unknown magnitude along the boundaries of the region to be analyzed, then setting up and solving a system of algebraic equations to find the discontinuity values that produce prescribed boundary tractions or displacements. The method is illustrated by comparing computed results with the analytical solutions of two boundary value problems; a circular disc subjected to diametral compression, and a circular hole in an infinite plate under a uniaxial stress field. In both cases the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. In part II the displacement discontinuity method is generalized to incorporate automatically a traction-free boundary condition for a semi-infinite region. This modification makes the general displacement discontinuity method suitable for analyzing &#039;cavity-type&#039; problems for the elastic half-space.",

          "abstract": "An imperfect bonding problem associated with a solitary circular inclusion embedded in an infinite matrix under a remotely applied uniform intensity is considered. Specifically, we study the effect of imperfect interfaces which are either of weakly or of highly conducting type and that the interface parameter could vary arbitrarily along the interface. By using the orthogonality properties of the trigonometric series, we show that the solution field is governed by a linear set of algebraic equations with an infinite number of unknowns. The governing matrix for the unknowns is primarily composed of elements which are simple combinations of the Fourier coefficients of the interface parameter. Solutions of the boundary-value problem are employed to estimate the effective conductivity tensor of a composite consisting of dispersions of circular inclusions with equal size. The effective properties solely depend on two particular constants among an infinite number of unknowns. It is demonstrated that, even for a composite with isotropic dispersions of inclusions, the composite may become effectively anisotropic due to the presence of a variable interface parameter. Further, we present two microstructure independent properties regarding the effective conductivity of the considered system. We first show that the effective conductivity tensor for a composite with variably imperfect interfaces is always diagonally symmetric. This is accomplished by means of a reciprocal relation that is established in such systems. Next, we present dual relations for the effective conductivities of two-dimensional composites with variably imperfect interfaces. The latter result is a direct consequence of the existence of a dual relation for the local fields in such composites, as pointed out by Benveniste and Miloh (Benveniste, Y., Miloh, T., 1999. J.

The fractions, fj′s, of 15 proteins are based on X-ray crystallography, ft refers to the net β-turn after cancelling those residues having dihedral angles of opposite sign. The [θ]Hx of an infinite helix and its chain-length dependence factor, k, were computed from the myoglobin data (Chen et al., 1974, Biochemistry, 13, 3350). The average number of residues per helical segment, n, for 15 proteins was about 10, which can be used for proteins of unknown structure. The reference spectra of other three structural elements are computed by a least-squares method. Once the reference spectra are chosen, the same equation above can be used to estimate the fractions of the secondary structure of a portein from its CD data points between 190 and 240 nm at 1-nm intervals. The computed helical content is usually good to excellent (concanavalin A is a notable exception). Inclusion of the β-turn in the analysis improves the correlation for the estimates of the β-form, but the computed βt values are not significantly correlated with the X-ray results. Matrix formulation proves the equivalence of the least-squares method and the integral curve-fitting. © 1978.",

          "abstract": "This paper is concerned with static analysis of functionally graded (FG) circular plates resting on Winkler elastic foundation. The material properties vary across the thickness direction so the power-law distribution is used to describe the constituent components. The differential transforms method (DTM) is utilized to solve the governing differential equations of bending of the thin circular plate under various boundary conditions. By employing this solution method, governing differential equations are transformed into recurrence relations and boundary/regularity conditions are changed into algebraic equations. In this study, the plate is subjected to uniform/non-uniform transverse load in two cases of boundary conditions (clamped and simply-supported). Some numerical examples are presented to show the influence of functionally graded variation, different elastic foundation modulus, and variation of the symmetrical transverse loads on the stress and displacement fields. Based on the results, the obtained out-plane displacement coincide with the available solution for a homogenous circular plate. It can be concluded that the applied method provides accurate results and it is easily used for static analysis of circular plates on an elastic foundation. ?? 2013 Politechnika Wroc??awska.",

The near-field dynamic moment concentration factor (DMCF) and the far-field scattering pattern are both investigated in this paper. The former has a connection with the fatigue failures and the defects in plate-like structures can be detected by the latter. Owing to the addition theorem, the multipole expansion for the multiple scattering fields can be transformed into one coordinate system centered at one circle where continuity conditions are required. In this way, a coupled infinite linear algebraic system is derived as an analytical model for an infinite thin plate with multiple circular inclusions subject to an incident flexural wave. The convergence analysis is conducted to provide the guideline of usage for the proposed method. The effects of the size and thickness of the flexible inclusion, and the central distance between inclusions on the near-field DMCF and the far-field scattering pattern are investigated in the numerical experiments. It shows that the scattering pattern correlates closely with the size and thickness of weakness, indicating the importance of the scattering pattern to detect the various defects. In addition, the DMCF of two corrosion defects is larger than that of one. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate structural safety when multiple circular defects are very close to each other. The effect of the space between the inclusions on the near-field DMCF is different from that on the far-field scattering pattern. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

In particular, this work is focused on the tension dominated failure. After an abrupt onset the crack grows unstably up to achieving an arrest length. A simple plane strain model of a single circular inclusion surrounded by an unbounded matrix allows obtaining conclusions approximately valid for a dilute fibre packing. Linear isotropic elastic behaviour is assumed for both inclusion and matrix. Two classical elastic solutions for both perfectly bonded and partially debonded circular inclusions are used together with a coupled stress and energy criterion, proposed recently in the framework of finite fracture mechanics, and a phenomenological law for fracture toughness of interface cracks growing in fracture mixed mode. The obtained analytical and semi-analytical expressions make easy studying the influence of all the dimensionless parameters governing the fibre-matrix system behaviour: Dundurs elastic bimaterial constants α and β, the interface brittleness number γ and the load biaxiality parameter η. A size effect of the inclusion radius on the critical load is predicted, smaller inclusions being stronger and less dependent on the secondary load.

The interface, which is modeled as a spring (interphase) layer with vanishing thickness, is characterized by that in which there is a displacement jump across the interface in the same direction as the corresponding tractions, and the same degree of imperfection is realized in both the normal and tangential directions. Furthermore, the interface parameter is nonuniform along the interface. In order to arrive at an elementary form solution, we introduce a conformal mapping function. Then the stress field as well as the Peach-Koehler force acting on the edge dislocation can be obtained from the derived complex potentials. Calculations demonstrate that the nonuniform interface parameter has a significant influence on the stress field. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The model for the matrix/inclusion interface is considered as a spring-type layer with vanishing thickness such that the interface effect can be described by continuous tractions but discontinuous displacements across the interface layer. By using analytic continuation in a dual coordinate system, two interfacial conditions lead to the simultaneous equations for two analytical vector functions. The two vector functions which are the main part of the expressions of displacement and stress function are expanded in forms of Laurent&#039;s series.

The methodology for this research is illustrated by solving an example that the matrix is subjected to a remote uniform stresses field and the three interfacial parameters of homogeneous imperfect interface are identical. The simple and straightforward features of the application of our results reveal the applicability to those problems which is under more complicate external loading.",

When 0 &lt; Oc, it was found that an existing debond kinked into the core. The desired face/core debond failure occurred when 0 &gt; Oc.

In this paper, Airy stress functions are used to derive Eshelby&#039; s tensor for a circular inclusion with imperfect interface. The interface is modeled as a spring layer with vanishing thickness. The normal and tangential displacement discontinu- ities at the interface are proportional to the normal and shear stresses at the interface. Unlike the case of the perfectly bonded inclusion, the Eshelby &#039; s tensor is, in general, not constant for an inclusion with the spring layer interface. The normal stresses are dependent on the shear eigenstrain. A closed-form solution for a circular inclusion with imperfect interface under general two-dimensional eigenstrain and uniform ten- sion is obtained. The possible normal displacement overlapping at the interface is discussed. The conditions for nonoverlapping are established.",

By using the principle of equivalent eigenstrain recently proposed (Ma and Korsunsky, 2014, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 51, 4477-4484), the main difficulty in solving inhomogeneous inclusion problems is overcome through the use of the equivalent uniform eigenstrain formulation, allowing the general explicit analytical solution to be derived.

This criterion enables to compare the two different post-failure configurations found in the literature studying this problem: an asymmetric configuration with a single debond and a symmetric one with two debonds. The coupled criterion applied here predicts that an asymmetric post-failure configuration is originated by a lower critical remote tension than the symmetric one, the difference being above 10% in some cases. Thus, the asymmetric debond onset is the preferred solution to the initially symmetric problem, which agrees with the experimental evidences found in the literature. This result is a consequence of the shielding effect between the two debonds in the symmetric solution. Numerical results are obtained for two common composites, glass/epoxy and carbon/epoxy, and three virtual bimaterials corresponding to the extreme values of the Dundurs elastic parameters. The stress-strain curves predicted for the two post-failure configurations are also compared. Eventually, simplified models using springs and breakable elements, which capture the essence of the problem studied and explain the energetic origin of the loss of symmetry, are introduced.",

          "abstract": "A systematic experimental study to determine the effect of curvatures and debond on the flexural stiffness and strength of composite sandwich beam structures made from fiber-glass/epoxy laminate skins and polyurethane foam core has been carried out. Flat and curved sandwich beams (with 15??, 30??, 45?? and 60?? open angle) with debond located at the top (upper) and bottom (lower) face/core interface were manufactured. Flexural stiffness and strength were determined from impulse frequency response technique and four-point bending. Vibration test results indicate that the natural frequencies and apparent stiffness are less affected by the presence of curvature and debond, whereas, the loss factors are significantly affected. Four-point test results indicate a reduction in stiffness due the presence of debonds and curvature, but more predominantly, the results show that the peak load reduces sharply with the presence of upper debond. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Energy harvesting using piezoelectric materials is not a new concept, but its small generation capability has not been attractive for mass energy generation. For this reason, little research has been done on the topic. Recently, increased interest in wearable computer concepts and remote electrical devices has provided motivation for more extensive study of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The theory behind cantilever-type piezoelectric elements is well known, but the transverse moving plate elements, which can be used in energy generation from pressure sources is not yet fully developed. The power generation in a pressure-loaded plate depends on several factors. Among them, the thickness of each layer is important, as is the electrode pattern used. In this article, two clamped circular plate structures, a fully electroded unimorph, and a so-called regrouped electrode unimorph, are modeled. These models are then used to calculate energy generation with varying thickness ratios. The results of this analysis are presented with an eye toward guidelines for design of useful energy harvesting structures.",

The boundary-value problem is solved by using the complex potential method, but the usual two-fold conformal transformations are avoided by employing the elliptic-hyperbolic coordinate system, which is physical and natural. All expressions for stress and displacement fields are derived in explicit form to provide a complete analysis and to make the solution ready for engineering use. With two adjustable parameters - the biaxial loading factor ?? and the orientation angle ?? - contained in these expressions, the present solution furnishes a most general account of the elliptic hole problem. It is shown that all existing solutions, including the solution of a cracked plate under biaxial loading, can be obtained from this general solution. In addition, the solution for an important biaxial loading case characterizing thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessels, which has not been reported before, is also derived in the paper as a specific case of the general solution.",

In the mining industry, interest in problems of this type mainly derives from displacements that occur at the soil surface, which may cause considerable damage. Similar damage may occur when constructing tunnels in densely populated areas. Analytical expressions for the subsidence due to multi-tunnelling activities usually do not match very well with the measured field results. One of the possible explanations for the discrepancy between the two is the interaction of the tunnels. Simple superposition of the effects of each tunnel may give reasonable results if the distance between the tunnels is large, but not when the tunnels are constructed close together. To gain more insight into the phenomenon of interaction, an analytical solution is presented in this paper for an infinite elastic medium. Comparison of the solution with two computer packages, FLAC 2D and PLAXIS, supports the finding that the interaction of circular holes indeed causes an increase in the displacements. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The mixed mode loading at the debond crack tip is controlled by changing the load application point in the MMB test fixture. Sandwich specimens were manufactured using H45 and H100 PVC foam cores and E-glass/polyester face sheets. All specimens were pre-cracked in order to define a sharp crack front. The static debond fracture toughness for each material configuration was measured at different mode-mixity phase angles. Fatigue tests were performed at 80% of the static critical load, at load ratios of R = 0.1 and 0.2. The crack length was determined during fatigue testing using the analytical compliance expression and verified by visual measurements. Fatigue crack growth results revealed higher crack growth rates for mode I dominated loading. For specimens with H45 core, the crack grew just below the face/core interface on the core side for all mode-mixities, whereas for specimens with H100 core, the crack propagated in the core or in the face laminate depending on the mode-mixity at the debond crack tip. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Such practice requires solving the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE). Unfortunately, explicit analytical solutions are available only for the weakly charged surfaces. Analysis of arbitrarily charged surfaces is possible only through cumbersome numerical computations. A compact analytical solution of the one-dimensional PBE is presented for two plates interacting in symmetrical electrolytes. The plates can have arbitrary surface potentials at infinite separation as long they have the same sign. Such a condition covers a majority of the colloidal systems encountered. The solution leads to a simple relationship which permits determination of surface potentials, surface charge densities, and electrostatic pressures as a function of plate separation H for different charging scenarios. An analytical expression is also presented for the potential profile between the plates for a given separation. Comparison of these potential profiles with those obtained by numerical analysis shows the validity of the proposed solution. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

In order to keep the elastic problem tractable, we consider a straight edge dislocation interacting with a cylindrical inclusion of infinite extent. Additionally, since we are concerned with interactions at elevated temperatures, we allow the matrix-inclusion interface to slip. We find that along approximately 1 2 of the glide planes intersecting the inclusion, the dislocation is attracted toward the inclusion. Dislocations originally lying on those glide planes, where the dislocation-inclusion interaction is repulsive, respond by either climbing on to a glide plane where the interaction is attractive or by diffusionally relaxing the repulsion. Therefore, a dislocation that is gliding on my plane that intersects the inclusion will end its trajectory at the inclusion-matrix interface. When the dislocation-inclusion separation is of order a dislocation core diameter, the dislocation core relaxes into the inclusion-matrix interface, thereby pinning the dislocation. Unpinning the dislocation requires a stress of order the Orowan stress, which is believed to give rise to the observed threshold stress for creep in dispersion strengthened systems. © 1983.",

          "abstract": "In Part I of this two-part paper, the scattering of SH waves by a rigid cylindrical inclusion partially debonded from its surrounding matrix is investigated by using the wave function expansion method and singular integral equation technique. The debonding regions are modeled as multiple arc-shaped interface cracks with non-contacting faces. Expressing the scattered fields as the wave function expansions with unknown coefficients and considering the mixed boundary conditions, we reduce the problem to a set of simultaneous dual series equations. Then dislocation density functions are introduced as unknowns to transform these dual series equations to a set of singular integral equations of the first type which can be easily solved numerically by using the quadrature method of Erdogan and Gupta [Int. J. Solids Structures 7, 1089-1107 (1972)]. The solution is valid for arbitrary values of KT0r0 (where KT0 is the wave number and r0 the inclusion radius) and arbitrary numbers and sizes of the debonds. Explicit solutions are obtained in two limiting situations : (i) the long wavelength limit (KT0r0 ??? 1). In this case, the solution reduces to the quasistatic solution ; (ii) the small debond limit with KT0r0 = O(1). This means the wavelength greatly exceeds the debond size and the solution is identical to that of a flat interface crack between a rigid half space and an elastic one subjected to static loading at infinity. If the debond is small and KT0r0 ??? 1, the solution will give the results of a flat interface crack subjected to an incident SH wave. Finally, the numerical results of the dynamic stress intensity factors, the rigid body translations of the inclusion and the scattering cross-sections are presented for an inclusion with one or two debonds. The phenomenon of low frequency resonance discovered by Yang and Norris [J. Mech. Phys. Solids 39, 273-294 (1991)] for an elastic inclusion with one debond is shown and its dependence upon the various parameters is discussed. The solution of this problem is relevant to ultrasonic nondestructive detection of debonding and is expected to have applications to the question of how dynamic loading can lead to growth of debonds [Norris and Yang, Mech.

Subcritical debond-growth rates in the range of 10 -5 to 10 -11 m/s were characterized as a function of the applied strain energy release rate, G A. Particular attention was given to the relationship between the debond tip strain energy release rate, G tip, and the measured debond growth rates. The kinetics of interfacial debond growth were rationalized in terms of a stress-dependent chemical reaction and mass transport of the environmental species to the debond tip. The order of the chemical reaction with respect to water was determined and found to be surprisingly high (n∼5). In the transport-controlled region, the rate of debond growth was found to increase linearly with the partial pressure of water vapor.

          "abstract": "A general method is developed for the rigorous solution of a problem associated with a circular inclusion embedded within an infinite matrix in antiplane shear. The bonding at the inclusion-matrix interface is assumed to be imperfect. Most significant is the fact that the imperfection in the interface is assumed to be circumferentially inhomogeneous. Using analytic continuation, the basic boundary-value problem for two analytic functions is reduced to a first-order differential equation for a single analytic function and the closed-form solution is obtained. The method is illustrated using several specific examples. The results from these examples are compared to the corresponding results when the imperfection in the interface is homogeneous. These comparisons illustrate how the circumferential variation of the parameter describing the imperfection has a pronounced effect on the stresses induced within the inclusion.",

This allows a Finite Element analysis to be undertaken using a two-dimensional membrane discretization. Predictions of the direct reflection of the S0 mode and the lateral scattering of the SH0 mode are made for a range of diameters of the hole. At the same time, an analytical solution based on modal superposition is developed, and this is also used to predict the reflection and scattering coefficients. Both sets of predictions are validated by experimental measurements. It is found that the trends of the reflection coefficients for different hole diameters, frequencies and distances from the hole satisfy a simple normalization.

In efforts to counteract these hydrolytic degradation effects, two clinically relevant Co-Cr-Mo surface morphologies were treated with an organosilane adhesion promoter (gamma-methacyloxypropyltrimethoxy) before interface bonding. Samples were quantitatively characterized in terms of the adhesion (fracture) and subcritical debond growth-rate (fatigue) behavior of the interface. The steady-state interface debond resistance, Gss (J/m2), was shown to increase with application of the silane pretreatment both in air (20 degrees C, 45% relative humidity) and simulated physiological environment (37 degrees C, Ringer&#039;s). Similarly, positive shifts in the subcritical debond threshold, deltaG(TH), values are observed for silane pretreated interfaces. A shift in the debond path from primarily adhesive failure in untreated surfaces to cohesive failure between the silane layer and bulk polymethylmethacrylate for silane treated surfaces was observed. Silane pretreatment of Co-Cr-Mo surfaces was shown to effectively limit the degree of the environmental degradation. General insights to the effects of surface roughness, chemical enhancement, and the environmental effects on the thermodynamics at the interface and resulting debond behavior are discussed.",

          "abstract": "The structural performance and reliability of the foam-core sandwich composites are known to be dependent on the strength of the core-skin bonding. Mechanical tests have repeatedly demonstrated that the failure modes for the sandwich during flexural, compression, and tension loading are first triggered by the failure of the interface or the sub-interface zones between the core and the skin. Once this failure mode sets in, core shear and delamination progress rapidly, leading to the final failure of the sandwich construction. The strength of the core-skin bonding depends on the chemical reactions taking place during the cure process. The effect of processing parameters and material properties on the core-skin bonding strength were investigated experimentally. The skin-core debond fracture toughness was measured using Tilted Sandwich Debond specimens. Verifying the heuristics developed in the previous part of this paper [Srinivasagupta et al., Compos. Part A, in press], we achieved a 78% increase in debond fracture toughness with elevated temperature processing, and observed reduced variability with higher suction pressures. We also saw increase in debond fracture toughness with foam density, validating the assumption that interfacial bonding controls the debond fracture toughness. An increase in resin uptake with foam density was an interesting observation from these experiments. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The governing equations as well as the boundary conditions for these generalized displacement functions are derived from the original equations of equilibrium for axisymmetric problems and the boundary conditions on the upper and lower surfaces of the plate. Explicit expressions are then obtained through a step-by-step integration scheme, with five integral constants determinable from the boundary conditions at the cylindrical surface in the Saint Venant&#039;s sense.

          "abstract": "Thin films bonded to substrates are common in semiconductor dielectric stacks and in other applications. Often, in these systems, the mismatch in the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion between the films and the substrate result in significant compressive stresses during processing. These compressive stresses may lead to instabilities and possibly debonding. In the present study, we develop analytical descriptions of buckling and wrinkling-induced debonding by incorporating a cohesive zone model. The temperature excursion leading to buckling or wrinkling, the peak deflection values of the films, the wavelength of the wrinkling pattern, as well as the temperature excursion to the onset of damage are estimated analytically by minimizing the total energy of the combined film-cohesive zone system. Analytical estimates of cohesive stiffness and strength are provided based on (possibly experimentally) observed temperature excursions to the onset of instability and debonding. A non-dimensional grouping of parameters combining characteristics of film, cohesive zone and geometry is identified to be of importance in separating regimes with different debonding characteristics. Special conditions for the non-dimensional grouping emerge for film wrinkling to occur. Full-field simulations based on an incremental Spectral Method are presented to study wrinkling. This approach extends the applicability of the Spectral Method to phenomena involving non-linear foundations, non-monotonic and non-proportional loading. Results from numerical simulations using the incremental Spectral Method are compared with analytical estimates. The analytical derivation is found to provide reasonable estimates of wrinkling wavelength and amplitude but overestimates the cohesive strength. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Intermediate crack induced debonding is a common failure mode for FRP strengthened concrete beams. This kind of failure mode can be studied with direct shear test, which involves a FRP plate bonded on a concrete prism with a stretching force acting on one end of the plate. To investigate the failure mechanism of the plate-to-concrete joint, a simplified bond slip model with a linear ascending segment and an exponential softening segment is proposed for the plate-to-concrete interface. With the bond-slip model, the closed-form solutions for the tensile stress in FRP plate, interfacial shear stress and displacement of the FRP plate are derived and verified with experimental results. With the analytical model, a theoretical model is proposed for calculating the effective bond length of a plate-to-concrete joint. Effect of different parameters including stiffness of FRP plate, interfacial fracture energy and interfacial shear strength on the effective bond length are comprehensively studied. Finally, a simple analytical solution of the bond strength for the cases with bond length smaller than the effective bond length is derived and compared with the complicated closed-form solution reported in the literature. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This method, which is based on fracture mechanics, models the skin and stiffener with two-dimensional (2D) plate elements instead of three-dimensional (3D) solid elements. The skin and stiffener flange nodes are tied together by two modeling techniques. In one technique, the corresponding flange and skin nodes are required to have identical translational and rotational degrees-of-freedom. In the other technique, the corresponding flange and skin nodes are only required to have identical translational degrees-of-freedom. Strain energy release rate formulae are proposed for both modeling techniques. These formulae are used for skin-stiffener debond cases with and without cylindrical bending deformations. The cylindrical bending results are compared with plane-strain finite element results. Excellent agreement between the two sets of results is obtained when the second technique is used. Thus, from these limited studies, a preferable modeling technique for skin-stiffener debond analysis using plate elements is established. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The liquid is assumed to be incompressible, inviscid and irrotational. The effect of the free surface wave is also taken into account in the analysis. First of all, the exact expression of velocity potential of the liquid movement is derived by a combination of the superposition method and the method of separation of variables. With the help of the Fourier–Bessel series expansion, part of the unknown coefficients in the solution is determined by the consistency condition between the liquid movement and the plate vibration, in the form of integrals associated with the dynamic deflection of the plate. Then, the Galerkin method is applied to derive the eigenfrequency equation of the fluid–plate interaction. Finally, the effects of various parameters and the free surface wave on eigenfrequencies of the fluid–plate system are discussed. As a consequence, the accuracy of the nondimensional added virtual mass incremental (NAVMI) factor solution has also been evaluated by comparing with the more accurate Galerkin solution. It is shown that the proposed method is also applicable to the vibration analysis of circular plates in contact with an infinite liquid by only taking a finite but larger size of liquid to replace the infinite liquid in the computation.",

A parametric study as a function of kappa reveals interesting physics, ranging from oscillatory &quot;pluglike&quot; flows to cases analogous to the oscillating flat plate in a semi-infinite flow domain (Stokes&#039; second problem). The latter case differs from the Stokes&#039; second solution within the EDL, since the flow is driven with an oscillatory electric field rather than an oscillating plate. The analogous case of plate oscillating with the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity matches our analytical solution in the bulk flow region. This indicates that the instantaneous Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity is the appropriate electroosmotic slip condition even for high-frequency excitations. The velocity profiles for large kappa values show inflection points very near the walls with localized vorticity extrema that are stronger than the Stokes layers. This have the potential to result in low Reynolds number flow instabilities. It is also shown that, unlike the steady pure electroosmotic flows, the bulk flow region of time periodic electroosmotic flows are rotational when the diffusion length scales are comparable to and less than the half channel height.",

The non-normality condition is due to the consideration of transverse shearing strains, disregarded in the classical bi-harmonic Kirchhoff plate model. As the plate thickness is reduced and/or the transverse shear modulus is increased. the deformed configuration is less dependent of the transverse shear strains and, in the limit as the plate thickness approaches zero and/or the transverse shear modulus approaches cc, the transverse shear strain effects vanish and the problem is exactly that described by the classical plate model. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental solutions of both the fourth-order Kirchhoff and the sixth-order Reissner and Mindlin plate models. We consider a transversely isotropic material and show that the fundamental solution of the bi-harmonic problem can be obtained directly from the general fundamental solution of the sixth-order plate problem, in the limit as the plate thickness approaches zero and/or the transverse shear modulus approaches m. This solution is in agreement with the analytical solution of an infinite thin clamped circular plate submitted to a unitary concentrated load acting at its center.",

In this paper, a simple method is presented to obtain an analytical solution for Eshelby&#039;s problem of an inclusion of arbitrary shape within an anisotropic plane or half-plane of the same elastic constants. The method is based on an observation that the interface conditions for arbitrary inclusion-shape can be written in a decoupled form in which three unknown Stroh&#039;s functions are decoupled from each other. The solution is given in terms of three auxiliary functions constructed by three conformal mappings which map the exteriors of three image curves of the inclusion boundary, defined by three Stroh&#039;s variables, onto the exterior of the unit circle. With aid of these auxiliary functions, techniques of analytical continuation can be applied to the inclusion of any shape. The solution is given in the physical plane rather than in the image plane, and is exact provided that the expansion of every mapping function includes only a finite number of terms. On the other hand, if at least one of the mapping functions includes infinite terms, a truncated polynomial mapping should be used, and thus the method gives an approximate solution. A remarkable feature of the present method is that it gives elementary expressions for the internal stress field within an inclusion in an anisotropic entire plane. Elliptical and polygonal inclusions are used to illustrate the construction of the auxiliary functions and the details of the method.",

The second part of this paper develops a novel semianalytical approach, derived from the contour integral equation, for modeling of circular ports assuming infinitely large reference planes. It will be shown that the radial waveguide method is a low frequency approximation of our approach and neglects the scattering among the open ports. The analytical solutions for infinite planes are then combined with the contour integral method to model finite-sized power planes. This improves the computational efficiency since a discretization of circular ports is avoided, especially for problems with a large number of circular ports.",

In this paper, we use perturbation technique to obtain a general analytical solution of thin circular plate with different moduli in tension and compression, in which four edge conditions including rigidly clamped, clamped but free to slip, simply hinged and simply supported are considered. Because the perturbation solution is expanded in ascending powers of a known perturbation parameter (central deflection, for example) and the unknown constants and functions in the solution are gradually determined by decomposing boundary conditions and governing equation, the constants and functions obtained in such a manner have an inherent consistency concerning material properties. The results show that via construction of some parameters reflecting materials properties, not only the solution based on bimodular elasticity theory may regress to that on classical theory with singular modulus, but also the solution obtained under simply hinged edge may serve as a general solution to describe other three edge conditions. Via the general solution, the relations of load vs. central deflection, the plate-membrane transition for bimodular problem and the radial membrane stresses and bending stresses at the center and edge of the plate, are also discussed. Moreover, the comparison between the analytical solutions and numerical results indicates that the perturbation solutions based on the central deflection are overall valid.

          "abstract": "The solution for the elastic three-phase circular inclusion problem plays a fundamental role in many practical and theoretical applications. In particular, it offers the fundamental solution for the generalized self-consistent method in the mechanics of composites materials. In this paper, a general method is presented for evaluating the interaction between a pre-existing radial matrix crack and a three-phase circular inclusion. The bonding at the inclusion-interphase interface is considered to be imperfect with the assumption that the interface imperfections are constant. On the remaining boundary, that being the interphase-matrix interface, the bonding is considered to be perfect. Using complex variable techniques, we derive series representations for the corresponding stress functions inside the inclusion, in the interphase layer and the surrounding matrix. The governing boundary value problem is then formulated in such a way that these stress distributions simultaneously satisfy the traction free condition along the crack face, the imperfect interface conditions and the prescribed asymptotic loading conditions. Stress intensity factor (SIF) calculations are performed at the crack tips for different material property combinations, imperfect interface conditions and crack positions. The results illustrate convincingly the role of an interphase layer as well as the effects of an imperfect interface on crack behavior. For instance, when the interphase layer is softer than the inclusion and matrix, the results show that the radial matrix crack will propagate from the nearby crack tip regardless of the level of the imperfect (spring-layer) interface parameter. In comparison, when the interphase layer is stiffer than the inclusion and matrix, the interphase layer will shield the crack from effects of the imperfect (spring-layer) interface. Hence, these results provide a quantitative description of the interaction problem between a three-phase inclusion with interface imperfections and a radial matrix crack.",

The motional, radiation, and diaphragm impedances of the damped membrane are calculated, together with the near- and far-field pressure responses and efficiency. A comparison is made between the on-axis response (without damping) calculated using this method and using a finite element model.

The experiments were conducted at a Reynolds number of Re=7.4×104 for cylinder aspect ratios of AR=9, 7, 5 and 3. The thickness of the boundary layer on the ground plane relative to the cylinder diameter was δ/D=1.5. The splitter plates were mounted on the wake centreline with negligible gap between the base of the cylinder and the leading edge of the plate. The lengths of the splitter plates, relative to the cylinder diameter, ranged from L/D=1 to 7, and the plate height was always equal to the cylinder height. Measurements of the mean drag force coefficient were obtained with a force balance, and measurements of the vortex shedding frequency were obtained with a single-component hot-wire probe situated in the wake of the cylinder-plate combination. Compared to the well-studied case involving an infinite circular cylinder, the splitter plate was found to be a less effective drag-reduction device for finite circular cylinders. Significant reduction in the mean drag coefficient was realized only for the finite circular cylinder of AR=9 with intermediate-length splitter plates of L/D=1-3. The mean drag coefficients of the other cylinders were almost unchanged. In terms of its effect on vortex shedding, a splitter plate of sufficient length was able to suppress Kármán vortex shedding for all of the finite circular cylinders tested. For AR=9, vortex shedding suppression occurred for L/D≥5, which is similar to the case of the infinite circular cylinder. For the smaller-aspect-ratio cylinders, however, the splitter plate was more effective than what occurs for the infinite circular cylinder: for AR=3, vortex shedding suppression occurred for all of the splitter plates tested (L/D≥1); for AR=5 and 7, vortex shedding suppression occurred for L/D≥1.5. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "In this research, mechanical buckling of circular plates composed of functionally graded materials (FGMs) is considered. Equilibrium and stability equations of a FGM circular plate under uniform radial compression are derived, based on the higher order shear deformation plate theory (HSDT). Assuming that the material properties vary as a power form of the thickness coordinate variable z and using the variational method, the system of fundamental partial differential equations are established. A buckling analysis of a functionally graded circular plate (FGCP) under uniform radial compression is carried out and the results are given in closed-form solutions. The results are compared with the buckling loads of plates obtained for FGCP based on the first order shear deformation plate theory (FSDT) and classical plate theory (CPT) given in the literature. The study concludes that HSDT accurately predicts the behavior of FGCP, whereas the FSDT and CPT overestimates buckling loads. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The local heat transfer distributions are analyzed based on theoretical predictions and experimental results of the fluid flow characteristics in the various regions of jet impingement. The heat transfer at the stagnation point is analyzed from the static wall pressure distribution. Semi-analytical solution for heat transfer in the stagnation region is obtained assuming an axisymmetric laminar boundary layer with favourable pressure gradient. The heat transfer in the wall jet region is studied considering fluid flow over a flat plate of constant heat flux. However, heat transfers in the transition region are explained from reported fluid dynamic behaviour in this region.

The analysis of cracked concrete in the presence of inclusions such as steel expansions is a practical problem that needs special attention. The solution to the problem of interaction of an edge dislocation with a circular inclusion having circumferentially inhomogeneously imperfect interface is available in the literature. This analytical solution is used in the distributed dislocation technique to obtain the stress intensity factor for the cracked concrete in the presence of inclusion. The interface of the matrix and the inclusion is assumed inhomogeneously imperfect and the stress intensity factor is determined for the cracked concrete for a case of two identical cracks on diametrically opposite sides of the inclusion. Consideration of this general inhomogeneously imperfect interface is the contribution of this paper. The variation of the inhomogeneity parameters is studied and presented. Additionally, the general assumption for the interface is simplified to the special case of perfectly bonded interface. The observations for the perfect interface are coincident with the previously reported results.",

Introducing a stress function and a potential function, the governing equations are uncoupled to form equations describing the interior and edge-zone problems of FG plates. This uncoupling is then used to conveniently present an analytical solution for the non-linear asymmetric deformation of an FG circular plate. A perturbation technique, in conjunction with Fourier series method to model the problem asymmetries, is used to obtain the solution for various clamped and simply supported boundary conditions. The material properties are graded through the plate thickness according to a power-law distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents. The results are verified by comparison with the existing results in the literature. The effects of non-linearity, material properties, boundary conditions, and boundary-layer phenomena on various response quantities in a solid circular plate are studied and discussed. It is found that linear analysis is inadequate for analysis of simply supported FG plates which are immovable in radial direction even in the small deflection range. Furthermore, the responses of FG materials under a positive load and a negative load of identical magnitude are not the same. It is observed that the boundary-layer width is approximately equal to the plate thickness with the boundary-layer effect in clamped FG plates being stronger than that in simply supported plates. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The stiffness matrix for the ring plate has been obtained using ring elements (FEM) in an explicit form and the stiffness matrix for the transversely isotropic halfspace models considered here have been obtained using a general analytical solution. The interface of ring plate and halfspace has been considered as smooth. The present approach automatically takes care of the semi-infinite nature of the transversely isotropic medium unlike the total finite element procedure where the halfspace is represented by a large size solid (discretised in to a large number of finite elements, especially in treating a multilayered halfspace) with certain imposed constraints.

Various effects on the fiber/matrix interfaces (perfect bond, homogeneously imperfect interfaces, uniform interphase layers) are allowed. The analysis of nano-composite materials based on the Gurtin and Murdoch model of material surface is also included. The basic idea of the approach is to construct a circular inhomogeneity in an infinite plane whose effects on the displacements and stresses at distant points are the same as those of a finite cluster of inhomogeneities (fibers of circular cross-section) arranged in a pattern representative of the composite material in question. The elastic properties of the equivalent inhomogeneity then define the effective elastic properties of the material. The volume ratio of the composite material is found after the size of the equivalent circular inhomogeneity is defined in the course of the solution procedure. This procedure is based on a semi-analytical solution of a problem of an infinite plane containing a cluster of non-overlapping circular inhomogeneities subjected to loading at infinity. The method works equally well for periodic and random composites and - importantly - eliminates the necessity for averaging either stresses or strains.

The hydraulic conductivity is of the form K(i)exp(alphah) where the saturated conductivity K-i is different in the main flow regime and the inclusion, a is a constant in the entire flow domain, and h is the pressure head. The problem reduces to the Helmholtz equation as previously used by J. R. Philip and colleagues for solving problems with impermeable regions or cavities in an unsaturated regime. The pressure heads are continuous on the interface of the inclusion. The normal flow velocities at the interface are matched approximately using the analytical element method recently exploited for saturated domains in several studies. Flow enhancement and exclusion through the circular inclusions are dependent on the value of a and the radius of the cylinder but otherwise are similar to that for the saturated case. For example, for ratios of the inclusion to background saturated conductivity of 0.5 the flow is 0.74 of what it would be without the inclusion compared to 0.67 for the saturated case. This was calculated for a dimensionless radius (0.5 a multiplied by the physical radius) of 1. When the ratio of the inclusion saturated conductivity to the background is 5, the comparable value for the unsaturated case is 1.45 and for the saturated case is 1.67. -Other",

          "abstract": "The instability behaviour associated to a crack onset and propagation along the fibre-matrix interface in a composite system under remote transverse loads is studied by a means of the linear elastic - (perfectly) brittle interface model (LEBIM). LEBIM has proved to model adequately the behaviour of this interface represented by a continuous distribution of springs which simulates the presence of a thin elastic layer. The failure mechanism in the case of an isolated fibre under transverse tension (plane strain problem), i.e. the onset and growth of the fibre-matrix interface crack, is studied. The numerical results provided by a 2D boundary element analysis show that a fibre-matrix interface failure initiates by onset of a finite debond in the neighbourhood of an interface point where the failure criterion is reached first (under increasing proportional load), this debond further propagates along the interface in mixed mode or even, in some configurations, with the crack tip under compression.",

Closed form solutions for the elastic fields are obtained by using a method based on the influence functions. An infinite multilayered plate containing a cuboidal inhomogeneity with eigenstrains is considered. Approximate solutions of the elastic fields due to the inhomogeneity with slightly different stiffnesses from the infinite laminate are obtained by using the average equivalent eigenstrain method. Some numerical computations are carried out to examine the accuracy of the approximate solution. Our attention is also given to an arbitrarily shaped inclusion with a dilatational eigenstrain. It is shown that traces of the resultant stress and moment tensors are uniform inside the inclusion and independent of the inclusion shape. Laminate versions of the Milgrom-Shtrikman traces that are independent of the inclusion shape are derived.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we present semi-analytical solutions for two-dimensional equations governing transport of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (LNAPL) in unconfined aquifers. The proposed model is based on sharp interface displacement and steady groundwater flow assumptions, where both the water- LNAPL interface and the LNAPL-air interface are represented as sharp interfaces. In the case of steady groundwater flow, these equations can be reduced to a two-dimensional nonlinear solute transport equation, with the LNAPL thickness in the free product lens being the primary unknown variable. The linearized form of this solute transport equation falls into the category of two-dimensional transport equation with time-dependent dispersion coefficients. This equation can be solved analytically for an infinite domain region. In this paper, the general form of the analytical solution for the transport equation, as well as the solutions for some specific cases are presented. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed solution, numerical results obtained for two example problems are discussed and presented comparatively with a finite-element solution and other more restrictive solutions available in the literature. Although the solutions discussed in this paper have some simplifying assumptions, such as sharp-interfaces between fluid phases, steady groundwater flow and homogeneous aquifer properties, the semi-analytical solutions presented in this study may be used effectively as bench mark solutions in evaluating LNAPL migration in the subsurface. These solutions are simple and cost effective to implement and may be used in the calibration of other more complex numerical solutions that can be found in the literature.

The material properties are graded through the plate thickness according to a power-law distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents.

The load-deflection curves for different loadings, boundary conditions, and material constant in a solid circular plate are studied and discussed. It is shown that the behavior of FG plates with clamped or simply-supported boundary conditions are completely different. Under thermo-mechanical loading, snap-through buckling behavior is observed in simply-supported FG plates which are immovable in radial direction. Moreover, it is found that linear theory is inadequate for analyzing FG and also homogenous plates with immovable boundary supports in radial direction and subjected to thermal loading, even for deflections that are normally considered small. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The finite element model presented in this study relates the motion of the face sheets to the core through constraint equations utilizing the concept of slave and master nodes, thus representing a more realistic model of the sandwich panel. The composite face sheets are modeled with shell elements, and the core is modeled using the 3D structural solid elements capable of taking transverse flexibility into consideration. In order to model the debond, the constraints between the nodes of the face sheet and the core are removed and replaced with contact elements in the debonded region to avoid interpenetration. The model is validated through comparison with experimental results reported in the literature. The validated model is then used to study the effects of the size, shape, aspect ratio of the debond, as well as fiber orientation of the face sheets and the influence of core stiffness on the buckling load of the panel subject to different boundary conditions on the top and bottom face sheets of the panel.",

The problem is formulated based on a conventional plate impact experimental configuration. In a plate impact test, the boundary condition at the plane of the impact varies with time as a result of multiple wave interactions at the interfaces of the layered target material. The approach of the solution is to convert the initial velocity boundary value problem to a time-dependent stress boundary value problem and then obtain the stress time history by means of superposition. By taking this approach, we explicitly consider multiple wave interactions at the heterogeneous interfaces. A characteristic steady-state stress ??mean for heterogenous material has been identified which is quite different from ??0 the stress at the initial time of impact. It is shown that ??mean can be obtained by summing up the stress increments at the interfaces or by using mixture theory. The late-time (steady-state) solution procedures for the plate impact problem are presented for impact velocities corresponding to elastic as well as shock wave loading conditions.

          "abstract": "We solve the problem of heat conduction in a 2D homogeneous medium (of diffusivity ??) below a boundary subjected to time-periodic temperature (of frequency ???), in the presence of a circular inhomogeneity (of radius R), whose center is at distance d &gt; R (depth) from the boundary. This study is a continuation of a previous one which considers a 3D medium with a spherical inhomogeneity. The general solution depends on four dimensionless parameters: d/R, the heat conductivity ratio ??, the heat capacity ratio C and the displacement thickness RCombining double low line2??/???R2). An analytical solution is derived as an infinite series of eigenfunctions pertaining to the 2D Helmholtz equation. The solution converges quickly and is shown to be in agreement with a finite element numerical solution. The results are illustrated and analyzed for a given accuracy and for a few values of the governing parameters. A comparison is held with the previous 3D solution pointing out the differences between the two. To widen the range of possible applications, an extension of the solution to a domain of finite depth is also presented. The general solution can be simplified considerably for asymptotic values of the parameters. A first approximation, obtained for R/d???1, pertains to an unbounded domain. A further approximate solution, for R/d???1, while ?? and C are fixed, can be regarded as pertaining to a quasi-steady regime. However, its accuracy deteriorates for R/d ??? 1, and a solution, coined as the insulated circle approximation, is derived for this case. Comparison with the exact solution shows that these approximations are accurate for a wide range of parameter values.",

          "abstract": "The solution for velocity and rate of deformation in an incompressible, homogeneously anisotropic viscous host embedding a cylindrical rigid inclusion subjected to a far-field shearing parallel to the anisotropy direction is presented. The rotation rate of the inclusion is equal to half the ambient shear rate independently of the anisotropy factor. The flow in the matrix localizes into conjugate shear bands sub-parallel to the anisotropy directions as the anisotropy factor increases. The presented anisotropic analytical solution, which neglects the bending stiffness, approximates the flow in a layered medium in the limit of infinitely thin layers. An initially planar layering is deflected adjacent to the inclusion and fold trains propagate into the host with progressing deformation. Numerical simulations show that the structural development leads to a decrease in the inclusion rotation rate and eventually to inclusion stagnation at high strains. The fold shapes become more angular and the fold trains reach further out into the host as the anisotropy factor is increased. Increasing the layering thickness (up to only 9 layers intercepting the inclusion) has no significant effect on how the layer inclusion rotation rate evolves with strain. A coarse layering in the host leads to a strongly reduced outreach of the fold trains and the absence of tight folds. The analytical solution, which is derived for a planar anisotropy in the host, can be employed to approximate the structural development for a weakly anisotropic host or small deformation. Structural development of an anisotropic medium plays a major role in determining the system behavior for large deformation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of cyclic loading on the debond process of a roughened stem-cement interface used in total hip arthroplasty. The specific goals were to assess the effects of two surgeon-controlled variables (stem heating and degree of stem surface roughness) and to determine if an independent finite element-based fracture mechanics model could be used to predict the debond response. A clamped cantilever beam geometry was used to determine the fatigue debond response of the stem-cement interface and was created using an experimental mold that simulated in vivo cementing conditions. A second experiment was performed using a torsion-loading model representative of the stem-cement-bone composite. For both experiments, two stem heating (room temperature and 50°C) and surface roughness conditions (grit blasted: Ra = 2.3 and 5.1 μm) were used. Finally, a finite element model of the torsion experiment with provision for crack growth was developed and compared with the experimental results. Results from both experiments revealed that neither stem preheating nor use of a stem with a greater surface roughness had a marked effect on the fatigue debond response. There was substantial variability in the debond response for all cases; this may be due to microscopic gaps at the interface for all interface conditions. The debond rate from the finite element simulation (10-7.31 m/cycle) had a magnitude similar to the experimental torsion model (10 -(6.77 ± 1.25) m/cycle). This suggests that within the context of the experimental conditions studied here that the debond response could be assessed using a linear elastic fracture mechanics-type approach. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc",

The analysis is restricted to axisymmetric moderately large deflection of the plate subjected to a thermal load, radial edge load or edge displacement and actuated by applying an electric potential across a piezoelectric layer. The accuracy of this solution is assessed by comparison with the numerical series solution using collocation. The direct piezoelectric effect is neglected in the governing equations. The piezoelectric layers are assumed to be very thin and having Young&#039;s modulus and density much smaller than those of the elastic core. Hence, their stiffness and inertia are neglected. The rotational and inplane inertia and the shear deformation are neglected in the Von Karman type classical thin plate theory used in the analysis. Comparison with the collocation solution establishes that the Galerkin solution yields quite accurate results for the problems considered. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Based on the assumption of a generalised plane-strain theory, which assumes that the through-the-thickness extensional strain is uniform in the thickness direction, an exact three-dimensional solution has been obtained for an annulus subjected to arbitrary loading along its edges. Emphasis has been placed on the through-the-thickness stress constraint, which is a pre-requisite to analysing the effect of plate thickness on the elastic-plastic deformation at a notch root. Important results are presented on the effects of the plate thickness and Poisson&#039;s ratio on the in-plane stress concentration factor and the out-of-plane stress constraint factor. By extending the theoretical method to a plate with a non-circular notch, an approximate solution has been obtained for the through-the-thickness constraint factor in a plate with a V-shaped notch having a circular tip. The present solutions have been shown to correlate well with numerical results obtained using the finite element method. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The solutions may be used for predicting solute concentrations in homogeneous media, verification of more comprehensive numerical models, and laboratory or field determination of solute transport parameters. The transport equation incorporates terms accounting for advection, dispersion, zero-order production, and first-order decay. General solutions were derived for an arbitrary initial distribution and solute input with the help of Laplace, Fourier, and Hankel transforms. Specific solutions are presented for rectangular and circular solute inflow regions, as well as for solutes initially present in the form of parallelepipedal or cylindrical regions of the medium. The solutions were mathematically verified against simplified analytical solutions. Examples of concentration profiles are presented for several solute transport parameters using both first- and third-type boundary conditions. A mass balance constraint is defined based on a prescribed solute influx; the third-type condition is shown to conserve mass whereas the first-type condition was found to always overestimate resident solute concentrations in the medium.",

          "abstract": "This work extends the analytical solution of an interface crack in straight layered structures to circular layered structures. A small segment at the vicinity of an interface crack tip in a circular laminated beam is analyzed by a novel shear deformable bi-layered circular beam theory. Two concentrated forces are found existing at the crack tip due to the requirement of the equilibrium condition. Closed-form solution of the total energy release rate of the interface crack is obtained as the half of the product of the concentrated forces and the corresponding displacement gradient discontinuities at the crack tip. Closed-form expressions of the mode I and II components of the energy release rate are also obtained by global and local methods. Numerical verifications are conducted by analyzing the interlaminar delamination of a circular beam with an edged crack and comparing with the baseline results obtained through finite element analysis. Excellent agreements between the present method and finite element analysis on the predictions of total energy release rate and mode partition verify the accuracy and efficiency of the present solution. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "A new closed-form solution is presented for the stress and displacement distribution surrounding circular openings with finite external radii that are subject to uniform internal and external pressures under plane strain conditions. The specific solution for a deep circular tunnel in an infinite rock mass is also provided. It is assumed that the rock mass is elastic-brittle-plastic and governed by the Unified Strength Theory (UST). In the plastic zone, the radius-dependent Young&#039;s modulus (RDM) model and a non-associated linear flow rule were adopted to establish the radial displacement solution. The new closed-form solution obtained in this paper is a series of results rather than one specific solution; hence, it is suitable for a wide range of rock masses and engineering structures. The traditional solutions, which are based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and the Generalized Twin Shear Stress yield criterion, can be categorized as special cases of this proposed solution. This new solution agrees reasonably well with the results of a borehole collapse test, a secondary development numerical simulation and an additional closed-form solution using the generalized non-linear Hoek-Brown failure criterion. Parametric studies were conducted to investigate the effects of intermediate principal stress, RDM and dilatancy on the results. It is shown herein that the effects of intermediate principal stress and dilatancy are significant; the RDM model is recommended as the optimum approach for calculating radial displacement and support pressure. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. The objectives of this experiment were to determine whether the incorporation of a surfactant into a combined etchant and activator solution would further promote the polymerization of an anaerobic adhesive. Method. Stainless steel attachments were bonded to human enamel using an anaerobic adhesive. In each case the enamel was etched and activated using a solution of 37% o-phosphoric acid containing copper (II) sulphates or chlorides with one of three surfactants also within the solution. After bench curing, the specimens were shear bond tested to failure and the load at debond recorded in each case. Results. The results were analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities and log-rank tests along with a multiple comparison test, using Bonferroni&#039;s method. Conclusions. Under the conditions of this experiment the addition of a surfactant to a combined etchant activator solution of 37% o-phosphoric acid and either copper (II) sulphate or copper (II) chloride, prior to the use of an anaerobic adhesive can have a significant effect on measured force to debond. However, with copper (II) sulphate the highest force to debond was observed with the control solution without a surfactant. With copper (II) chloride the surfactant Tween 20 increased the observed force to debond but the effect was not statistically significant. Significance. Although it is possible to render the enamel surface both retentive and active towards anaerobic adhesives using a combined etchant and activator solution, the addition of a surfactant has little or no beneficial effect. © 2004 Academy of Dental Materials.

Groups of 20 bonded teeth were then placed in a test solution, control (distilled water), peppermint oil (5 minutes and 1 hour), acetone (1 hour), and ethanol (1 hour). The teeth were debonded using an Instron. Universal Testing Machine and debond forces recorded. The site of bond failure along with the adhesive remnant index was recorded for each tooth. One hour placement in peppermint oil produced the lowest mean and maximal debond forces (77 and 114 N, respectively). Weibull analysis showed that the probability of failure at 100 N was increased for the 1-hour peppermint group at 88 per cent compared with 52 per cent for the control.

The present solution for solid circular cylinders of finite length can be considered as a 3-D counterpart of the classical two dimensional (2-D) solutions by Hertz in 1883 and by Hondros in 1959. The contacts between the two steel diametral loading platens and the curved surfaces of a cylindrical specimen of length H and diameter D are modeled as circular-to-circular Hertz contact and straight-to-circular Hertz contact for ISRM and ASTM standards respectively. The equilibrium equations of the linear elastic circular cylinder of finite length are first uncoupled by using displacement functions, which are then expressed in infinite series of some combinations of Bessel functions, hyperbolic functions, and trigonometric functions. The applied tractions are expanded in Fourier-Bessel series and boundary conditions are used to yield a system of simultaneous equations. For typical rock cylinders of 54 mm diameter subjected to ISRM indirect tensile tests, the contact width is in the order of 2 mm (or a contact angle of 4) whereas for typical asphalt cylinders of 101.6 mm diameter subjected to ASTM indirect tensile tests the contact width is about 10 mm (or a contact angle of 12). For such contact conditions, 50 terms in both Fourier and Fourier-Bessel series expansions are found sufficient in yielding converged solutions. The maximum hoop stress is always observed within the central portion on a circular section close to the flat end surfaces. The difference in the maximum hoop stress between the 2-D Hondros solution and the present 3-D solution increases with the aspect ratio H/D as well as Poisson&#039;s ratio ν. When contact friction is neglected, the effect of loading platen stiffness on tensile stress in cylinders is found negligible. For the aspect ratio of H/D = 0.5 recommended by ISRM and ASTM, the error in tensile strength may be up to 15% for both typical rocks and asphalts, whereas for longer cylinders with H/D up to 2 the error ranges from 15% for highly compressible materials, and to 60% for nearly incompressible materials. The difference in compressive radial stress between the 2-D Hertz solution or 2-D Hondros solution and the present 3-D solution also increases with Poisson&#039;s ratio and aspect ratio H/D. In summary, the 2-D solution, in general, underestimates the maximum tensile stress and cannot predict the location of the maximum hoop stress which typically locates close to the end surfaces of the cylinder. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "This paper deals with the failure of compression loaded sandwich panels with an implanted circular face/core debond. Uniform compression tests were conducted on intact sandwich panels with three different types of core material (H130, H250 and PMI) and on similar panels with circular face/core debonds having three different diameters. The strains and out-of-plane displacements of the panel surface were monitored using the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Mixed mode bending (MMB) tests were conducted to determine the fracture toughness of the interface of the panels. Finite element analysis and linear elastic fracture mechanics were employed to determine the critical buckling load and compression strength of the panels. Modeling approaches and failure criteria are discussed. Numerically determined crack propagation loads in most of the cases show a fair agreement with experimental results, but in a few cases up to 45% deviation is seen between numerical and experimental results. This can be mainly ascribed to the large scatter in the measured interface fracture toughness, differing crack tip details and crack growth mechanisms between the panels and the MMB specimens. Tentative strength reduction curves are presented, but uncertainty concerning the intact strengths of the materials used needs to be removed before these can be utilized with confidence.",

Owing to the addition theorem, all kernel functions are represented in the degenerate form and further transformed into the same polar coordinates centered at one of circles, where the boundary conditions are specified. Thus, not only the computation of the principal value for integrals is avoided but also the calculation of higher-order derivatives in the flexural plate problem can be easily determined. By matching the specified boundary conditions, a coupled infinite system of simultaneous linear algebraic equations is derived as an analytical model for the title problem. According to the direct searching approach, natural frequencies are numerically determined through the singular value decomposition (SVD) in the truncated finite system. After determining the unknown Fourier coefficients, the corresponding mode shapes are obtained by using the direct boundary integral formulations for the domain points. Several numerical results are presented. In addition, the inherent problem of spurious eigenvalue using the integral formulation is investigated and the SVD updating technique is adopted to suppress the occurrence of spurious eigenvalues. Excellent accuracy, fast rate of convergence and high computational efficiency are advantages of the present method thanks to its analytical features. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The one-doublet mode model of a disc and a discrete model equivalent to the one-doublet mode model are proposed for providing a more fundamental understanding of the onset of squeal. The analytical models are validated through a comparison of results from a modal expansion model obtained from finite element component models.

The time-dependent electroelastic field in the cracked composite system is obtained. Particularly the time-dependent stress and electric displacement intensity factors at the crack tip, jumps in the displacement and electric potential across the crack surfaces, displacement jump across the viscous interface, and image force acting on the piezoelectric screw dislocation are all derived. It is found that the value of the relaxation (or characteristic) time for this cracked composite system is just twice as that for the same fibrous composite system without crack.

          "abstract": "The subject of this paper is the plate composed of two identical isotropic outer layers and a more compliant inner interlayer, perfectly connected to one another at the interface (three-layered plate). This paper presents a model that describes the behavior of this plate by a system of exact analytical (explicit) equations. An analytical model is preferred over finite element models and simplified formulas if it is fast and easy-to-use. Thus, modeling has been developed within the framework of two-dimensional elasticity, instead of three. In so doing, the model also represents a means for attaining full comprehension of the involved phenomena, something that neither three-dimensional elasticity nor finite element models and simplified formulas can attain. The two-dimensional behavior is governed here by using assumptions that do not impose constraints on the behavior. Starting from these assumptions, the paper illustrates the relationships between displacements and interface stresses. The subsequent sections of the paper describe the model and present some real case applications. The contribution of this paper is to consider both the shear modulus and the elastic modulus of the interlayer. Thus, this model applies to three-layered plates with any interlayer, whether utterly compliant or relatively stiff. Conversely, the previous exact analytical models assumed zero elastic modulus, and hence they applied to utterly compliant interlayers only. Hence, not only does the new model predict the exact behavior of plates that the former analytical models described only approximately, but this model may also be used as a benchmark for finite element models, which cannot assign zero value to the elasticity modulus of the interlayer together with the actual shear modulus. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The formulation is facilitated by an extended Betti&#039;s reciprocal theorem and an extended Somigliana&#039;s identity based on the SSGET and suitable for plane strain problems. The disturbed displacement field is obtained in terms of the SSGET-based Green&#039;s function for an infinite plane strain elastic body, which differs from that in earlier studies using the three-dimensional Green&#039;s function. The solution reduces to that of the infinite-domain inclusion problem when the boundary effect is suppressed. The problem of a cylindrical inclusion embedded concentrically in a finite plane strain cylindrical elastic matrix of an enhanced continuum is analytically solved for the first time by applying the general solution, with the Eshelby tensor and its average over the circular cross section of the inclusion obtained in closed forms. This Eshelby tensor, being dependent on the position, inclusion size, matrix size, and a material length scale parameter, captures the inclusion size and boundary effects, unlike existing ones. It reduces to the classical elasticity-based Eshelby tensor for the cylindrical inclusion in an infinite matrix if both the strain gradient and boundary effects are not considered. Numerical results quantitatively show that the inclusion size effect can be quite large when the inclusion is very small and that the boundary effect can dominate when the inclusion volume fraction is very high. However, the inclusion size effect is diminishing with the increase of the inclusion size, and the boundary effect is vanishing as the inclusion volume fraction becomes sufficiently low. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This solution is based on: (i) the evaluation of the conformal mapping function of a hole of prescribed shape by an appropriate numerical scheme and (ii) the closed-form solutions of the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili complex potentials. For the particular case of circular notches - which resemble to the circular cavity breakout in rocks - it is demonstrated that numerical results pertaining to boundary stresses and displacements predicted by the finite differences model FLAC2D, as well as previous analytical results referring to the stress-concentration-factor, are in agreement with analytical results. It is also illustrated that the solution may be easily applied to non-rounded diametrically opposite notch geometries, such as &quot;dog-eared&quot; breakouts by properly selecting the respective conformal mapping function via the methodology presented herein. By employing a stress-mean-value brittle failure criterion that takes into account the stress-gradient effect in the vicinity of the curved surfaces in rock as well as the present semi-analytical solution, it is found that a notched hole, e.g. borehole or tunnel breakout, may exhibit stable propagation. The practical significance of the proposed solution lies in the fact that it can be used as a quick-solver for back-analysis of borehole breakout images obtained in situ via a televiewer for the estimation of the orientation and magnitude of in situ stresses and of strain-stress measurements in laboratory tests. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Equilibrium and stability equations of a FGM circular plate under thermal loads are derived, based on the higher order shear deformation plate theory (3rd order plate theory). Assuming that the material properties vary as a power form of the thickness coordinate variable z and using the variational method, the system of fundamental partial differential equations is established. A buckling analysis of a functionally graded circular plate (FGCP) under various types of thermal loads is carried out and the result are given in closed-form solutions. The results are compared with the critical buckling temperature obtained for FGCP based on first order (1st order plate theory) and classical plate theory (0 order plate theory) given in the literature. The study concludes that higher order shear deformation theory accurately predicts the behavior of FGCP, whereas the first order and classical plate theory overestimates buckling temperature. ?? 2004 Elsevier SAS.

The driving moment and force are sinusoidal in time and applied to a small rigid indenter with a circular base, fixed to the plate. The solution is obtained from a three-dimensional approach but is evaluated only for low frequencies, where the wavelengths of the quasi-longitudinal, tranverse and bending waves are much larger than the thickness of the plate. For the case of excitation with a torsional moment, the solution contains two parts, one describing a travelling transverse wave and the other a local reaction. The local reaction is built up of two infinite sums of Love waves with imaginary wave numbers. The driving-point admittance due to the local reaction is larger than the admittance due to the tranverse wave when the diameter of the indenter is smaller than about twice the thickness of the plate. For the case of excitation with a horizontal force, the solution contains three parts that describe travelling waves (quasi-longitudinal, transverse and bending) and two parts that describe the local reaction (infinite sums of Lamb and Love waves). The admittances due to the three types of travelling waves are all of the same order of magnitude. The admittance due to the local reaction is of importance when the frequency is relatively high and the diameter of the identer much smaller than the thickness of the plate. For both cases of excitation, the admittance due to the local reaction increases with increasing thickness of the plate and tends to the value found for a semi-infinite medium. ?? 1984.",

The major cause of damage formation under quasi static compression is found to be low temperature brittle cracking effects taking place below some critical temperature levels within the range from -20 ??C to -30 ??C. The magnitude of critical temperature is increasing as the displacement controlled loading speed increases. The maximal strain achieved during the compression phase is found to be less influential, however it still significantly affects the shape and size of damage. The phenomenon is described in terms of the theory of thin elastic plates (beams) on a piece-wise linear foundation of Kelvin-Voight type. In particular, exact analytical solutions are derived to describe the damage formation. The dependence of the corresponding load on effective strain reveals a jump of slope at yielding point, which is in perfect match with experimental observations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The wave function at an arbitrary point of space is expressed in terms of the discontinuity in its normal derivative (or the residual function which measures its deviation from the simple distribution appropriate to a completely infinite screen) is the result of applying the boundary condition to the space wave function. An integral equation for the discontinuity in normal derivative (or the residual function which measures its deviation from the simple distribution appropriate to a completely infinite screen) is the result of applying the boundary condition to the space wave function. Utilizing the integral equation (whose solution is generally unobtainable), the diffracted spherical wave amplitude at large distances from the aperture is cast into a form which is stationary with respect to small variations (relative to the correct values) of the residual functions arising from a pair of incident waves. An homogeneous expression for the amplitude is exhibited wherein the part independent of the residual functions defines a Kirchoff approximation. The connection with another stationary form of the amplitude, involving a pair of aperture wave functions, is examined. A variational expression for the plane wave transmission cross section of the aperture is based on the amplitude observed in the direction of incidence. The variational formulation is applied for a wave incident normally on a circular aperture. By comparison with the exact results available for this problem, it appears that use of simple residual functions in the variational formulation yields approximate, yet accurate expressions for the diffracted amplitude and transmission cross section over a wide range of frequencies.",

In particular, in the pharmaceutical field, cyclodextrin complexation is mainly used to increase the aqueous solubility and dissolution rate of poorly soluble drugs, and to enhance their bioavailability and stability. Analytical characterization of host-guest interactions is of fundamental importance for fully exploiting the potential benefits of complexation, helping in selection of the most appropriate cyclodextrin. The assessment of the actual formation of a drug-cyclodextrin inclusion complex and its full characterization is not a simple task and often requires the use of different analytical methods, whose results have to be combined and examined together.The purpose of the present review is to give, as much as possible, a general overview of the main analytical tools which can be employed for the characterization of drug-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes in solution, with emphasis on their respective potential merits, disadvantages and limits. Further, the applicability of each examined technique is illustrated and discussed by specific examples from literature.",

A semianalytical finite element method in which the deformation of the cross section is modeled by two-dimensional finite elements and analytical representation of propagating waves along the length of the plate has been used. The method is applicable to arbitrary number of layers and general anisotropic material properties of each layer, and is similar to the stiffness method used earlier to study guided waves in a laminated composite plate of infinite width. Numerical results showing the effect of varying the width of the plate on the dispersion of guided waves are presented and are compared with those for an infinite plate.

We extend our cumulant approach for solving the scalar (unpolarized) photon transport equation to the vector (polarized) case. As before, an exact angular distribution is obtained and a cumulant expansion is derived for the polarized photon distribution function. By a cutoff at the second cumulant order, a Gaussian analytical approximate expression of the polarized photon spatial distribution is obtained as a function of the direction of light and time, whose average center position and half-width are always exact. The central limit theorem claims that this spatial distribution approaches accuracy in detail when the number of collisions or time becomes large. The analytical expression of cumulants up to an arbitrary high order is also derived, which can be used for calculating a more accurate polarized photon distribution through a numerical Fourier transform. Contrary to what occurs in other approximation techniques, truncation of the cumulant expansion at order n is exact at that order and cumulants up to and including order n remain unchanged when higher orders are added, at least as applied in our photon transport equation.",

Since then peridynamics has been applied to a variety of solid mechanics problems ranging from fracture, damage, failure to wave propagation, buckling, and detonation physics. Since the governing equation of peridynamics is an integro-differential equation, most of the treatment in the literature is often numerical. However, the analytical treatment is very important for the development of the peridynamic theory, which is continually developing at the present time. In this paper, peristatic and peridynamic problems for a 1D infinite rod are analytically investigated. We have developed a method to obtain a valid analytical solution starting from a formal analytical solution, which may be divergent. The primary contribution of the present paper is a systematic analytical treatment of peristatic and peridynamic problems for a 1D infinite rod. Additionally, dispersion curves and group velocities for the materials with three different micromoduli are also studied. It is found from the study that some peridynamic materials can have negative group velocities in certain regions of wavenumber. This indicates that peridynamics can be used for modeling certain types of dispersive media with anomalous dispersion such as the one discussed by Mobley (2007). ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The flow caused by the plate is represented by a distribution of vortices along the plate that satisfy the linear free-surface, radiation and sea-bottom conditions in the frequency domain. The vortex density is expressed as the sum of a Fourier series and terms that account for the flow singularities at the plate edges. When the plate is perforated, a quadratic (nonlinear) pressure loss condition, which relates the pressure loss/difference to the square of the transverse velocity, is assumed in our detailed studies. A time-efficient iterative solution technique is applied, and less than 10 Fourier series terms are needed to obtain high accuracy. The added mass and damping, wave loads, wave transmission and reflection depend on a perforation-effect Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number that combines the effects of the perforation ratio, discharge coefficient and KC number. The presented method is verified by comparing it with published results based on other solution methods. The influence of the wave number, submergence, water depth and perforation-effect KC-number is illustrated. Techniques to minimize wave transmission are discussed. ?? 2012.",

Stresses along the FRP-concrete interface are of great importance to the effectiveness of this type of strengthening because high stress concentration along the FRP-concrete interface can lead to the FRP debonding from the concrete beam. In this study, we develop an analytical solution of interface stresses in a curved structural beam bonded with a thin plate. A novel three-parameter elastic foundation model is used to describe the behavior of the adhesive layer. This adhesive layer model is an extension of the two-parameter elastic foundation commonly used in existing studies. It assumes that the shear stress in the adhesive layer is constant through the thickness, and the interface normal stresses along two concrete/adhesive and adhesive/FRP interfaces are different. Closed-form solutions are obtained for these two interfacial normal stresses, shear stress within the adhesive layer, and beam forces. The validation of these solutions is confirmed by finite element analysis. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Therefore, both ideas of using the local variations of the displacement field and satisfying a priori the continuity conditions of the transverse stresses at the layer interfaces for predicting the global and local responses of the sandwich circular plates are employed, for the first time. The resulting governing equations are then solved by a semi-analytical Maclaurin-type power-series solution. Each layer of the plate may be made of functionally graded materials.

The boundary-value problem corresponding to the case of distributed horizontal and rocking ring loads at a bi-material interface is solved to obtain the required influence functions for the solution of the present problem. The case of an embedded rigid plate is formulated in terms of a discretized integral equation, which couples the rigid body displacements of the plate with the tractions acting over its contact surface through a set of displacement influence functions. The system of resulting discretized integral equations is solved numerically. The solution results in the tractions over each disc element. This paper carefully takes into account the coupling of the rocking and horizontal responses of the plates that is typical of non-homogeneous interfaces, i.e., their horizontal displacements due to rocking moments and their rotations due to horizontal loads. The dynamic direct and cross compliances of the embedded plate are shown for different governing parameters such as frequency of excitation and bi-material configuration.

          "abstract": "The Eshelby-type problem of an arbitrary-shape polygonal inclusion embedded in an infinite homogeneous isotropic elastic material is analytically solved using a simplified strain gradient elasticity theory (SSGET) that contains one material length scale parameter. The Eshelby tensor for a plane strain inclusion with an arbitrary polygonal cross section is derived in a general form in terms of three potential functions, two of which have the same definitions as the ones involved in the counterpart Eshelby tensor based on classical elasticity. These potential functions, as area integrals over the polygonal cross section, are first converted to three line (contour) integrals using Green&#039;s theorem, which are then evaluated analytically by direct integration. The newly derived Eshelby tensor is separated into a classical part and a gradient part. The former contains Poisson&#039;s ratio only, while the latter includes the material length scale parameter additionally, thereby enabling the interpretation of the inclusion size effect. For homogenization applications, the area average of the new Eshelby tensor over the polygonal cross section is also provided in a general form. To illustrate the newly obtained Eshelby tensor and its area average, three types of polygonal inclusions are quantitatively studied by directly using the general formulas derived. The numerical results show that the components of the SSGET-based Eshelby tensor for all inclusion shapes considered vary with both the position and the inclusion size. It is also observed that the components of the averaged Eshelby tensor based on the SSGET change with the inclusion size. By applying the newly derived solution, a homogenization analysis of a composite reinforced by polygon-shaped fibers is performed. The induced strain in the composite is evaluated, and the effective stiffness of the composite is predicted. It is found that the values of the induced strain components approach from below those in a corresponding composite reinforced by circular fibers when the fiber size or the number of sides of the polygonal fiber increases. Also, the analysis reveals that the components of the effective stiffness tensor vary slightly with the fiber shape, and thus the simpler solution for the circular inclusion problem may be used to estimate the effective stiffness of a composite reinforced by regular polygon-shaped fibers.?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

For the purposes of the efficiency and simplicity, one must use an analytical solution for a single circular hole in an infinite domain, subjected to the arbitrary traction on the circle boundary. Then, the analytical solution correlates with a successive iterative superposition process capable of satisfying the prescribed boundary conditions in the plane problems with the multiple holes. Comparisons between the solutions of the present procedure and the conventional boundary element technique demonstrate the accuracy and the advantages. Effects of the number of holes and the spaces on the stress concentration factors also are evaluated in detail herein.",

Test parameters including initial debond geometry, flange material stiffness, and the adhesive critical strain energy release rate (Gc) were investigated. Debond growth was found to be strongly dependent on initial debond length but weakly dependent on flange width; i.e., debonding resistance did not increase in direct proportion with the bonded overlap dimension. Flanges having higher bending stiffness exhibited significantly lower debonding strain. Finally, the effect of Gc was evaluated at three levels by controlling the adhesive cure temperature and bondline thickness. Lower values of Gc (207 and 552 J/m2) allowed debond growth to occur while at the highest value of Gc (1500 J/m2), alternate failure modes occurred prior to debond growth. Ultrasonic C-scans revealed that debond growth occurred along a curved front, as dictated by the post-buckling deformation of the flanges. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Properties of the FGM media are distributed across the thickness based on a power law form. Each property of the metal or ceramic constituents is considered to be the function of temperature based on the Touloukian model. General equilibrium equations for such conditions are obtained based on the classical plate theory. At first, the non-linear governing equations are established in a complete asymmetrical form. After that, two different analytical methods are presented to study the bifurcation behaviour. Existence of bifurcation phenomenon is examined. Pre-buckling analysis is performed for a plate with the immovable clamped edge. Stability equations are obtained based on the adjacent equilibrium criterion. The resulted equations are solved via the two distinct methodologies, i.e. the exact solution in terms of Coulomb wave functions and the power series method. A non-linear solution is also presented to detect the equilibrium path of the heated rotating FGM plate. It is found that the angular speed may stabilize the homogeneous circular plate which buckles during uniform heating. Furthermore, snapping may occur for FGM plates under the simultaneous action of heating and uniform rotation. © 2013 The Franklin Institute.",

Thus, the results in terms of the stress intensity factors (SIFs) can be obtained by considering the latter problem, which is analyzed easily by means of the displacement discontinuity method with crack-tip elements proposed recently by the author. Test examples are given to illustrate that the numerical approach is very accurate for analyzing interacting multiple cracks in an infinite linear elastic media under remote uniform stresses. In addition, the displacement discontinuity method with crack-tip elements is used to analyze a multiple crack problem in a finite plate. It is found that the boundary element method is also very accurate for investigating interacting multiple cracks in a finite plate. Specially, a generalization of Bueckner&#039;s principle and the displacement discontinuity method with crack-tip elements are used to analyze multiple circular arc crack problems in infinite plate in tension (including: Two Collinear Circular Arc Cracks, Three Collinear Circular Arc Cracks, Two Parallel Circular Arc Cracks, Three Parallel Circular Arc Cracks and Two Circular Arc Cracks) in a plane elasticity plate. Many results are given. ?? 2009.",

          "abstract": "An approximate solution is determined for the motion of an infinite elastic plate, excited by a vertical force (normal to the plate) and by a moment in the vertical plane (with the axis of the moment parallel to the plate). The driving force and moment are sinusoidal in time and applied to a small, rigid indenter with a circular base, fixed to the plate. The solution is obtained from a three-dimensional approach but is restricted to low frequencies, where the wavelength of the longitudinal, transverse and bending waves are much larger than the thickness of the plate. The solution contains, for both cases of excitation, three parts that describe a bending wave, a longitudinal wave and a local reaction. The solution for the bending wave is exactly the same as that derived from the usual two-dimensional plate theory. The amplitude of the longitudinal wave will, in most cases in practice, be small compared with the amplitudes of the bending wave or the local reaction. The local reaction is built up of four infinite sums of waves with complex wave numbers. For the case of a thick plate, the amplitude of the local reaction for a constant force or moment increases with increasing thickness of the plate and approaches the value found for a semi-infinite medium. The amplitude decreases exponentially with the distance from the center of the indenter when this distance is larger than the thickness of the plate. In the opposite case the amplitude decreases with distance in approximately the same way as on the surface of a semi-infinite medium. Except for the local reaction at a distance from the indenter that is larger than thickness of the plate, the amplitudes of all waves are found to be independent of the size of the indenter, provided the indenter is small compared with the appropriate wavelength. © 1983.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the regions of debonding between the fibers and the matrix surrounding fiber breaks formed during single fiber fragmentation tests. The fiber breaks are accompanied by areas of debonding between the matrix and the surface of the fiber. With increasing applied strain, the lengths of these debonded regions generally increase. At the end of the test, the matrix tensile strain adjacent to the debond regions is an order of magnitude higher than the applied strain (40% vs. 4%). Although the debond edges typically remain attached at the same locations on the fiber fragments, debond propagation along fiber fragments under increasing strain has been observed in some cases. The phenomenon is termed secondary debond growth, and two mechanisms that trigger secondary debond region growth have been proposed. As expected, tests with bare fibers and with fibers coated to alter interface adhesion indicate that the average size of debonded regions at the end of the test increases as the calculated interfacial shear strength decreases. However, a decrease in the &quot;apparent&quot; interfacial shear strength resulting from an increase in testing rate results in a decrease in the size of the average debond region. This result suggests an increase in the amount of energy stored in the matrix from the fiber fracture process.",

In this paper, analytical expressions concerning the dynamic response of thin circular clamped GLARE plates, subjected to low velocity impact by a lateral hemispherical impactor are derived. This impact scenario is a typical test method in order to study the impact strength of laminates. Our previously published differential equations of motion derived using a spring-mass model, which correspond to loading and unloading impact stages, are now written as Duffing equations and treated analytically. Internal damage due to delamination is taken into account. The position where delamination occurs, the maximum central plate deflection and the maximum impact load are determined analytically, and employed to calculate the impact load, velocity and kinetic energy of the impactor as a function of its position. Furthermore, the impact load, position, velocity and kinetic energy time histories are calculated. Also, the position where the impact load becomes zero and the total impact duration are predicted. The derived analytical expressions are applied successfully to GLARE 4-3/2 and GLARE 5-2/1 plates, subjected to low velocity impact. The predicted load-time history response is compared with published experimental data and a good agreement is found.

Additional features of the theory are that it has strong similarity with classical plate theory in many aspects, and the number of involved variables is only two as against three in case of other shear deformation theories. The Levy-type solution procedure in conjunction with the state space concept is used to determine the closed-form solutions for orthotropic rectangular plates with two opposite edges simply supported and the other two edges having arbitrary boundary conditions.

          "abstract": "A complete semi-analytical solution is given for second-order diffraction of monochromatic waves by a truncated vertical circular cylinder in water of uniform finite depth. The methodology presented in detail elsewhere (Eatock Taylor &amp; Huang 1996) is adopted to find a particular solution which exactly satisfies the governing equation, the inhomogeneous free-surface condition and the seabed condition. In order to satisfy the boundary condition on the cylinder bottom, the fluid domain around the cylinder is divided into two regions. First- and second-order velocity potentials are described separately in the two regions and matched on the interface by the pressure and normal-velocity continuity conditions. Based on the formulation, the second-order wave field in the vicinity of the cylinder and the corresponding wave forces and overturning moments on the cylinder are studied in detail. Numerical results for the double frequency forces obtained by using the present semi-analytical approach are compared with those computed with a higher-order boundary element method (Eatock Taylor &amp; Chau 1992). As well as the exact solution, an approximate solution is also given for the second-order potential and the corresponding forces. Numerical results show that the approximate solution possesses excellent accuracy for the total second-order heave force over a wide range of conditions. When kb &gt; 1.2 (where k, b are the incident wavenumber and the draught of the cylinder respectively), the accuracy for total second-order surge force and pitch moment is also satisfactory. These results could lead to the development of very efficient solutions and corresponding algorithms for the analysis of second-order wave diffraction by more complicated structures such as tension leg platforms. Numerical results based on the present solution show that in many cases, both the first- and the second-order-free surface elevation in the vicinity of a truncated cylinder is very close to that of a bottom-seated cylinder. For waves with larger amplitudes, the maximum free-surface elevation around a vertical cylinder predicted with the second-order theory can significantly exceed that given by linear theory.

The material properties of FGM plates are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction according to a simple power law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents.

In the analysis, the geometric imperfections of the plate are taken into account. By using a shooting method the nonlinear ordinary differential equations with immovably clamped boundary conditions are solved numerically. Responses for the nonlinear thermomechanical post-buckling responses of the FGM plate are obtained. Numerical examples are presented that relate to the performances of perfect and imperfect, homogenous and graded plates. Characteristic curves of the post-buckling deformation of the imperfect FGM circular plate varying with thermal loads, imperfection parameters and volume fraction index are plotted. And then effects of the load parameters, materials constitution, and the geometric imperfection of the plate on the deformation are discussed in detail. ?? 2007.",

The total stiffness matrix of the transversely isotropic multilayered half-space is acquired by assembling the analytical layer-element of each soil layer with the aid of the continuity conditions between adjacent layers. According to the displacement condition of coordination between the plate and soil, the dynamic interaction problem is reduced to that of multilayered transversely isotropic half-space subjected to axisymmetric harmonic vertical loading.

          "abstract": "With the help of a 2D theoretical model, this paper analyses the modes of matrix detachment around a circular-elliptical rigid inclusion under pure and simple shear bulk deformations. Three modes of matrix detachment are possible: Mode 1 - the matrix is displaced normal to the inclusion boundary, forming fissures at the interface; Mode 2 the matrix slips along the inclusion boundary without any separation; Mode 3 - the detachment occurs by a combination of Modes 1 and 2. In order to determine the onset of detachment at any point on the coherent inclusion-matrix interface, the tensile and shear stresses were derived at that point, and compared with imposed critical values. Numerical simulations based on the theoretical model reveal that the three modes occur systematically along the inclusion-matrix interface, the geometrical dispositions of which depend on the aspect ratio (R) and orientation (??) of the inclusion. In the case of circular inclusions, Mode 1 and Mode 2 domains are separated by a Mode 3 domain and the disposition shows an internal symmetry. On the other hand, it is asymmetrical when the inclusions are elliptical and oriented oblique to the bulk extension direction in pure shear and to the shear direction in simple shear. In simple shear, Mode 2 detachment with synthetic slip occurs dominantly when ?? is less than 45?? and greater than 135??. The results obtained from numerical models are complemented with observations in physical experiments. The paper also determines theoretically the critical stresses for detachment to occur as a function of R for different ?? values, revealing that for a given mechanical strength of the inclusion-matrix interface, a particular mode of detachment can take place only when the aspect ratio crosses a threshold value. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Using Levy-type solution these equations are solved for the functionally graded rectangular plate with two opposite edges simply supported under different types of loading conditions. The excellent accuracy of the present analytical solution is confirmed by making some comparisons of the present results with those available in the literature.

On the basis of two kinematic assumptions and by means of variable transformation, the governing equations are derived. The double series approach provides a direct means of computation with second-order convergence. The solutions agree well with the published results for special cases of square layers and infinite strips, and with finite element results for rectangular layers.

This equation contains three flow parameters: the stream-wise pressure gradient (b), the magnetic parameter (M), and the boundary stretch parameter (k). Closed-form analyt- ical solution is obtained for b ¼?1 and M ¼ 0 in terms of error and exponential functions which is modified to obtain an exact solution for general values of b and M.We also obtain asymptotic analyses of the MHD Falkner–Skan equation in the limit of large g and k.

To study the interactions between the plate and the hole, the receptance approach is adopted. While a receptance reduction is used at the plate-hole interface, a receptance addition is used for the plate stiffeners at the clamped edge. The study shows that for a free-edge hole, a minimum value of the first natural frequency exists, corresponding to a critical radius of the hole, regardless of the plate boundary constraints. However, a similar result is only found when the edges of the plate and the cutout are both simply supported. Plates with other types of constraints show a monotonically increasing frequency as the radius of the hole is increased. This information can be used by designers while engineering rectangular plates with stiffened circular cutouts. Parts of the analytical results are verified by the finite element solutions. It shows that the receptance approach, both addition and reduction, provides a convenient tool with adequate accuracy for this type of vibrational studies. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The variation of horizontal force by single particle, total horizontal force and moment with respect to the wave amplitude are obtained at different depth of water and at different wave period.

The variation in material properties through the thickness of the plate introduces a coupling between in-plane and transverse displacements, the coupling is important in the vibration of functionally graded plates (FGPs), but none have produced an exact closed-form solution for the in-plane as well as transverse vibrations of smart circular/annular FGPs. Therefore, this paper develops an exact closed-form solution for the free vibration of piezoelectric coupled thick circular/annular FGPs subjected to different boundary conditions on the basis of the Mindlin&#039;s first-order shear deformation theory. Through the comparison of present results with those available, the accuracy of the present method was verified. The effects of coupling between in-plane and transverse displacements on the frequency parameters are proved to be significant. It is concluded that the developed model can describe vibrational behavior of smart FGM plates more realistic.

          "abstract": "The surface tension of liquid is generally negligible at macroscopic scale but can cause a lot of anomalous deformation of slender structures at small scales. In this study, we presented the analytical deflection solutions of a rectangular plate with two clamped ends and a clamped circular plate based upon the principle of superposition, where a droplet was deposited onto the micro-plate surfaces. In the light of these analytical solutions, the abnormal bending of the plate when the droplet is placed at different positions of the top or bottom surface of the plate was discussed in detail. The FEM (finite element method) simulation was also conducted, and the results show excellent agreement with our analytical solutions. We also put to use the FEM simulation to explore the displacement field of a more general plate with complex boundary conditions and complicated loads originating from the droplet, and the folding of a soft membrane caused by a droplet was also simulated. This investigation is beneficial to understand the physical mechanisms underlying the droplet-induced deformation of slender structures, and is of great interest for the design of new materials and devices by utilizing the effects of surface tension at micro and nano scales. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

          "abstract": "Following the success of seismic analysis of a canyon [1], the problem of SH-wave diffraction by a semi-circular hill is revisited using the null-field boundary integral equation method (BIEM). To fully utilize the analytical property in the null-field boundary integral equation approach in conjunction with degenerate kernels for solving the semi-circular hill scattering problem, the problem is decomposed into two regions to produce circular boundaries using the technique of taking free body. One is the half-plane problem containing a semi-circular boundary. This semi-infinite problem is imbedded in an infinite plane with an artificial full circular boundary such that degenerate kernel can be fully applied. The other is an interior problem bounded by a circular boundary. The degenerate kernel in the polar coordinates for two subdomains is utilized for the closed-form fundamental solution. The semi-analytical formulation along with matching boundary conditions yields six constraint equations. Instead of finding admissible wave expansion bases, our null-field BIEM approach in conjunction with degenerate kernels have five features over the conventional BIEM/BEM: (1) free from calculating principal values, (2) exponential convergence, (3) elimination of boundary-layer effect, (4) meshless and (5) well-posed system. All the numerical results are comparing well with the available results in the literature. It is interesting to find that a focusing phenomenon is also observed in this study. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

The expression was obtained utilizing the analogy between electrostatic and elastic theory problems. The main idea lies in similarity of behavior of point charge electric field and the strain field induced by point inclusion in the matrix. This opens a way to simplify the structure of the expression for the strain tensor. In the solution, the strain distribution consists of contributions related to faces and edges of the inclusion. A contribution of each face is proportional to the solid angle at which the face is seen from the point where the strain is calculated. A contribution of an edge is proportional to the electrostatic potential which would be induced by this edge if it is charged with a constant linear charge density. The solution is valid for the case of inclusion having the same elastic constants as the matrix. Our method can be applied also to the case of semi-infinite matrix with a free surface. Three particular cases of the general solution are considered—for inclusions of pyramidal, truncated pyramidal, and “hut-cluster” shape. In these cases considerable simplification was achieved in comparison with previously published solutions.",

The multimode directivity depends on the amplitude and directivity function of each individual cut-on mode. The amplitude of each mode is expressed as a function of cut-on ratio for a uniform distribution of incoherent monopoles, a uniform distribution of incoherent axial dipoles, and for equal power per mode. The directivity function of each mode is obtained by applying a Lorentz transformation to the zero-flow directivity function, which is given by a Wiener-Hopf solution. This exact numerical result is compared to an analytic solution, valid in the high-frequency limit, for multimode directivity with uniform flow. The high-frequency asymptotic solution is derived assuming total transmission of power at the open end of the duct, and gives the multimode directivity function with flow in the forward arc for a general family of mode amplitude distribution functions. At high frequencies the agreement between the exact and asymptotic solutions is shown to be excellent.",

In this paper, the deflection is calculated for both circular and square plates using the full anisotropic plate equation. It is shown that the anisotropic calculations match excellently with FEM, whereas an isotropic approach causes up to 10% deviations in deflection. For circular plates, an exact solution can be found. For square plates using the Galerkin method, and utilizing the symmetry of the silicon crystal, a compact and accurate expression for the deflection can be obtained. The deviation from FEM in center deflection is &lt;0.1%. The theory of multilayer plates is also applied to the CMUT. The deflection of a square plate was measured on fabricated CMUTs using a white light interferometer. Fitting the plate parameter for the anisotropic calculated deflection to the measurement, a deviation of 0.07% is seen. Electrostatic and small-signal dynamic analysis are performed using energy considerations including anisotropy. The stable position, effective spring constant, pullin distance, and pull-in voltage are found for both circular and square anisotropic plates, and the pressure dependence is included by comparison with the corresponding analysis for a parallel plate. Measurements on fabricated devices with both circular and square plates subjected to increasing bias voltage are performed, and it is observed that the models including anisotropic effects are within the uncertainty interval of the measurements. Finally, a lumped element small-signal model for both circular and square anisotropic plates is derived to describe the dynamics of the CMUT.",

          "abstract": "Friction stir welding (FSW) is a relatively modern welding process, which not only provides the advantages offered by fusion welding methods, but also improves mechanical properties as well as metallurgical transformations due to the pure solid-state joining of metals. The FSW process is composed of three main stages; penetrating or preheating stage, welding stage and cooling stage. The thermal history and cooling rate during and after the FSW process are decisive factors, which dictate the weld characteristics. In the current paper, a novel transient analytical solution based on the Green&#039;s function method is established to obtain the three-dimensional temperature field in the welding stage by considering the FSW tool as a circular heat source moving in a finite rectangular plate with cooling surface and non-uniform and non-homogeneous boundary and initial conditions. The effect of penetrating/preheating stage is also taken into account by considering the temperature field induced by the preheating stage to be the non-uniform initial condition for the welding stage. Similarly, cooling rate can be calculated in the cooling stage. Furthermore, the simulation of the FSW process via FEM commercial software showed that the analytical and the numerical results are in good agreement, which validates the accuracy of the developed analytical solution. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.",

          "abstract": "A concrete beam can be strengthened by bonding a fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) plate to the tension face, and a common failure mode for such beams involves the debonding of the FRP plate that initiates at a major flexural crack, which is widely referred to as intermediate crack (IC) debonding. To understand IC and other debonding failures, the bond behaviour between FRP and concrete has been studied extensively using simple pull-off tests, in which a plate is bonded to a concrete prism and is subject to tension. However, the behaviour of the FRP-to-concrete interface in a beam can be significantly different from that captured in a pull-off test as, in a beam, whether debonding along the FRP-to-concrete interface occurs at a major flexural crack or not depends on the conditions at this crack as well as at the adjacent crack on the path of the debonding propagation. This paper is therefore concerned with the debonding process of an FRP-to-concrete bonded joint where the FRP plate is subject to tension at both ends, which closely approximates the IC debonding process in a flexurally strengthened RC member. The same problem has been the topic of a previous study by the authors, where a bilinear local bond-slip model was employed for the FRP-to-concrete interface. However, that solution is rather complex and difficult to apply in practice. The aim of this study is to produce a simplified solution by employing the simple linearly softening local bond-slip law for the interface. Results from this simplified analytical solution are compared with those from the previous solution, showing little loss of accuracy in predicting the load-displacement response and the ultimate load. The most significant outcome of the new solution is a simple expression for the ultimate load of the bonded joint which offers the potential for direct practical application. While the emphasis of the paper is on FRP-to-concrete joints, the solution and methodology are applicable to similar joints between other materials such as FRP-to-steel or steel-to-concrete bonded joints. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The axisymmetric case where the plane of transverse isotropy is perpendicular to the cylindrical axis is studied, and the stress-relaxation response to imposed step and ramp displacements is solved. This solution is then used to analyze experimental data from unconfined compression stress-relaxation tests performed on specimens from bovine distal ulnar growth plate and chondroepiphysis to determine the biphasic material parameters. The transversely isotropic biphasic model provides an excellent agreement between theory and experimental results, better than was previously achieved with an isotropic model, and can explain the observed experimental behavior in unconfined compression of these tissues.",

More precisely, we derive exact and explicit formulas for the matrix representing an applied magnetic field in the Laplacian eigenbasis and governing the magnetization evolution. For thin layers, a significant difference between two geometrical length scales (thickness and overall size) allows for accurate perturbative calculations. In these two-scale geometries, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a function of diffusion time exhibits a new region with a reduced but constant value. The emergence of this intermediate diffusion regime, which is analogous to the tortuosity regime in porous media, is explained in terms of the underlying Laplace operator eigenvalues. In general, regions with constant ADCs would be reminiscent of multiscale geometries, and their observation can potentially be used in experiments to detect the length scales by varying diffusion time.",

The method is illustrated by comparing computed results with the analytical solutions of two boundary value problems; a circular disc subjected to diametral compression, and a circular hole in an infinite plate under a uniaxial stress field. In both cases the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions.

Novel to this work is that the bonding at the inclusion-interphase interface and the interphase-matrix interface is considered to be imperfect with the assumption that the interface imperfections are constant. Employing complex variable techniques, we derive series representations for the corresponding stress functions inside the inclusion, in the interphase layer and the surrounding matrix. The advantage of the series method over other methods, such as the dislocation density method, is that in the former case the resulting expressions are linear and can be solved readily whereas in the latter case the method leads to cumbersome integral equations which are often numerically difficult to solve. Stress intensity factor (SIF) calculations are performed at the crack tips for different material property combinations, imperfect interface conditions and crack locations under mode I loading. The results not only provide for a quantitative description of the interaction between a radial interphase crack and a three-phase inclusion with imperfect interfaces but the results clearly demonstrate the significance of how two imperfect boundaries can influence crack behaviour.",

The circumferential mode numbers (n = 0) and (n = 1) are dealt with in this paper. The method is a hybrid of plate theory and finite element analysis. The plate is subdivided into one circular and many annular finite elements. Two new finite elements were developed, the first type being a circular plate and the second an annular plate, the displacement functions of the finite element model are the classical solution shape functions of plate theory. Mass and stiffness matrices are determined by precise analytical integration. The free vibrations of uniform circular and annular plates are studied by this method as well as non-uniform plates. The results obtained reveal that the frequencies calculated by this method are in good agreement with those obtained by other authors. This method combines the advantages of the standard finite element analysis and the high-accuracy formulation provided by the use of displacement functions derived from plate theory instead of the usual low-order polynomials. The present method is remarkable for the fact that it enables us to determine with equal precision both low and high natural frequencies. © 1999 Academic Press.",

          "abstract": "Green&#039;s functions of Laplace problems containing circular boundaries are solved by using analytical and semi-analytical approaches. For the analytical solution, we derive the Green&#039;s function using the bipolar coordinates. Based on the semi-analytical approach of image method, it is interesting to find that the two frozen images for the eccentric annulus using the image method are located on the two foci in the bipolar coordinates. This finding also occurs for the cases of a half plane with a circular hole and an infinite plane containing two circular holes. The image method can be seen as a special case of the method of fundamental solutions, which only at most four unknown strengths are required to be determined. The optimal locations of sources in the method of fundamental solutions can be captured using the image method and they are dependent on the source location and the geometry of problems. Three illustrative examples were demonstrated to verify this point. Results are satisfactory. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Therefore, this paper focuses on deriving the frequency equation for the in-plane vibration of the clamped circular plate of uniform thickness with an isotropic material in the elastic range. To derive the frequency equation for the clamped circular plate in the cylindrical coordinate, kinetic and potential energy for in-plane behavior were first obtained by using the stress-strain-displacement expressions and applying Hamilton&#039;s principle, which led to two sets of highly coupled differential equations for the equations of motion. Substitution of Helmholtz decomposition for the coupled differential equations produced uncoupled equations of motion. The assumption of a harmonic solution for the uncoupled equations led to wave equations. Using the separation of the variable, the general solutions for the wave equations were obtained. The solutions generated the in-plane displacements in the r and θ directions. Finally, the application of boundary conditions yielded the frequency equation for the clamped circular plate. The derived frequency equation was validated by finite element analysis and by comparison of previously reported results. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "External bonding of FRP plates or sheets has become a popular method for strengthening reinforced concrete structures. Stresses along the FRP-concrete interface are critical to the effectiveness of this technique because high stress concentration along the FRP-concrete interface can lead to the FRP debonding from the concrete beam. In this study, a novel analytical solution has been developed to predict the interface stress redistribution of FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete beams induced by the viscoelastic adhesive layer. Both the FRP plate and the RC beam are modeled as Timoshenko&#039;s beams, connected through the adhesive layer. The adhesive layer is modeled as a three-parameter viscoelastic foundation (3PVF) using Standard Linear Solid model. The 3PVF model satisfies the equilibrium equation of the adhesive layer and the zero shear-stress boundary condition at the free edge. Closed-form expressions of the time-dependent interface stresses and deflection of the beam are obtained using Laplace transform. Finite element analysis is also conducted to verify the analytical solution using a subroutine UMAT based on the Standard Linear Solid model. Numerical results suggest that the stress concentrations within the FRP-concrete interface relax with time. The axial force in the FRP plate also reduces with time due to the creep of the adhesive layer. However, this relaxation is limited to a small zone close to the end of the FPR plate. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

On the basis of this solution, an assumption about the in-plane displacements is made for a laminated plate of N layers, each of which possesses only a single plane of elastic symmetry parallel to the xy-plane. Under this assumption the in-plane displacements and transverse shear stresses are continuous between layers.

The laminate is modelled by means of first-order shear deformable layer-wise kinematics and the governing equations are formulated in the form of a non-linear differential system with moving intermediate boundary conditions related to opportune delamination and bridging growth conditions. The problem is solved through an analytical approach. The model leads to an accurate and self-consistent evaluation of the energy release rate and its mode components due to the inclusion of significant contributions arising from coupling between in-plane and transverse shear stresses, and to an asymptotic estimate of interlaminar stresses. The salient features of the proposed model are investigated in the context of an energy balance approach and of a J-integral formulation, thus providing simple results useful to model delamination growth and bridging behaviour when mixed mode loading is involved. The accuracy of the proposed model is substantiated through comparisons with results from continuum analysis obtained by a finite element (FE) procedure. The effectiveness of the proposed model is highlighted by showing the solution of a two-layered plate scheme subjected to pure and mixed mode loading conditions and to fibre bridging stresses. The results point out that the present model, despite its low computational cost in comparison with more complex FE analyses, is an efficient tool to predict delamination and bridging evolution. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Plate anchors are commonly used as foundations for structures that require uplift resistance. Although the pullout capacity of plate anchors in clay has been studied extensively, most of the studies were concerned with single layer soils. Natural soils are often formed in discrete layers while the understanding of plate anchor performance in multiple layer soils is relatively poor. In this study, the pullout capacity of a circular plate anchor with pre-embedments and the continuous pullout performance of the anchor are investigated numerically using an elasto-plastic finite element method. In the continuous pullout analysis the Remeshing and Interpolating Technique with Small Strain model (RITSS) has been used. The plate anchor is embedded in a stiff clay layer overlain by a soft clay layer. It is found that the pullout capacity of plate anchor depends on the distance between the plate and the soil layer boundary and the soil layer strength ratios. The critical distance is where the pullout capacity of plate starts to decrease when it moves closer to the interface of the soil layers. This critical distance decreases with increasing soil strength ratio (top soil strength/bottom soil strength). There are two stiff soil cones formed at both upper and lower sides of the plate as it is pulled into the top soft soil layer from the underlaying stiff soil layer. Comparing with the findings for plate in single soil layer with top soil strength, due to the stiff soil cones formed, an increased pullout capacity and delayed soil-plate separation are observed at soil strength ratios less than 2/3. © 2005 Taylor &amp; Francis Group.",

After using the fundamental solution and placing the distributed dislocations at the prospective sites of cracks, a singular integral equation is formulated. The singular integral equation is solved by using the curve length method in conjunction with the semi-opening quadrature rule. By taking an additional point dislocation at the hole center, the number of the unknowns is equal to the number of the resulting algebraic equations.

Also, an analytical solution for the dynamic response of functionally graded rectangular plates resting on the Pasternak foundation under the transverse loading is investigated. By extending classical plate theory, the displacement field is assumed as the in-plane and transverse displacements consist of bending and shear components and it therefore does not need to use the shear correction factor. The material properties are assumed to vary continuously in the thickness direction according to the power-law form. The equations of motion are derived by using Hamilton&#039;s principle. An analytical solution of simply supported FGM rectangular plates is presented by using state-space methods. The results obtained using the proposed refined plate theory are extensively compared with those obtained by the classical plate theory and finite element method. The accuracy of the new refined plate theory is demonstrated by comparing the results of chosen examples with ones predicted by other higher-order plate theories in previous studies. The effect of the power-law exponent index and the stiffness of the foundation on the behavior of the FGM plate are discussed in detail.",

As an example of the strength of the developed methodology, the Copenhagen and Prairie Grass experiments were simulated (finite media with the mean wind speed and the turbulent diffusion coefficient described by different functional forms). The results indicate that the present solutions are in good agreement with those obtained using other analytical procedures, previously published in the literature.

The problem is solved by expressing the electromagnetic field in both elliptical and circular wave functions, connected with one another by well-known expansion formulas. The procedure for solving the problem is cumbersome because of the nonexistence of orthogonality relations for Mathieu functions across the dielectric elliptical boundary. The solution obtained, which is free of Mathieu functions, is given in closed form, and it is valid for small values of the eccentricity h of the elliptical cylinder. Analytical expressions of the form S(h)=S(0)[1+g(2)h2+g(4)h4+O(h6)] are obtained, permitting an immediate calculation for the scattering cross sections. The proposed method is an alternative one, for small h, to the standard exact numerical solution obtained after the truncation of the system matrices, composed after the satisfaction of the boundary conditions. Both polarizations are considered for normal incidence. The results are validated against the exact solution, and numerical results are given for various values of the parameters.",

Following Goodier&#039;s work, the elastic fields inside and outside the inclusion are obtained analytically. It is found that the presence of interface stress leads to conclusion that the elastic field in the inclusion is not only dependent on inclusion size but also on non-uniformity.

          "abstract": "The influence of a face/core (F/C) debond on the flexural stiffness and strength of curved sandwich beams under opening bending moments has been experimentally examined. The sandwich beams consisted of glass/polyester face sheets over a PVC foam core. Debonds of various sizes were defined by inserting thin non-stick Teflon films at the outer F/C interface in the curved region of the beam prior to processing. The beams were tested in flexure in a specially designed four-point bend test fixture. The load versus displacement and surface strains at the apex of the beam were recorded to examine the response. It was observed that the debonded face sheet lifted off of the core and underwent a bifurcation associated with strain reversal. Beam failure occurred by propagation of the debond. It was observed that the beams suffered marginal reductions in stiffness, but substantial reductions in strength due to the presence of a debond. Linear finite element analysis was performed to examine the initial response of the beams.",

The remainder of the polymeric adhesive outside the cohesive layer is modeled as a nonlinear viscoelastic continuum with time-dependent constitutive behavior The influence of temperature and moisture concentration on the work-of-separation and on crack growth is derived from first principles. The model is implemented in a test-bed finite element code. Results predicted by the computational model are benchmarked through comparison to experimental data from mixed-mode fracture experiments performed using a moving wedge test.",

For comparison we also considered square and triangular periodic arrangements. We have studied elastic fields of such composites both experimentally, using a photoelasticity method, and numerically via a finite element method. We have found that random inclusion arrangements give higher stress concentrations than the periodic ones owing to stress localizations.

The problem is solved for any axisymmetric loading of a plate of uniform thickness and material parameters. This method can be easily extended to any axisymmetric plate solution without midplane forces. The material parameters in the plate and the supporting solid can be specified independently. In the specific examples included, plate deflections for a rigid wall assumption as opposed to a wall and plate of the same material never differ by less than 200%.

These solutions assume that the systems are laterally infinite. When a large-scale pumping from (or injection into) an aquiferaquitard system of lower specific storativity occurs, induced pressure perturbation (or hydraulic head drawdown/rise) may reach the lateral boundary of the aquifer.We developed semi-analytical solutions to address the induced pressure perturbation and vertical leakage in a laterally bounded system consisting of an aquifer and an overlying/underlying aquitard. A one-dimensional radial flow equation for the aquifer was coupled with a one-dimensional vertical flow equation for the aquitard, with a no-flow condition imposed on the outer radial boundary. Analytical solutions were obtained for (1) the Laplace-transform hydraulic head drawdown/rise in the aquifer and in the aquitard, (2) the Laplace-transform rate and volume of leakage through the aquiferaquitard interface integrated up to an arbitrary radial distance, (3) the transformed total leakage rate and volume for the entire interface, and (4) the trans- formed horizontal flux at any radius. The total leakage rate and volume depend only on the hydrogeologic properties and thicknesses of the aquifer and aquitard, as well as the duration of pumping or injection. It was proven that the total leakage rate and volume are indepen- dent of the aquifers radial extent and wellbore radius. The derived analytical solutions for bounded systems are the generalized solutions of infinite systems. Laplace-transform solu- tions were numerically inverted to obtain the hydraulic head drawdown/rise, leakage rate, leakage volume, and horizontal flux for given hydrogeologic and geometric conditions of the aquiferaquitard system, aswell as injection/pumping scenarios.

Three different patterns of vortex shedding are observed in the wake of the circular cylinder depending upon the frequency and amplitude of plate oscillation: normal shedding, chain of vortices and shedding from splitter plate. It is found that the inverse relationship between the vortex formation length and Strouhal number is not applicable when the splitter plate is subjected to oscillation. Additional related interesting fluid dynamics features are also presented. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "[1] We present observations from a continuous exposure of an ancient plate interface in the depth range of its former seismogenic zone in the central Alps of Europe related to Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary subduction and accretion of the South Penninic lower plate underneath the Adriatic upper plate. The material forming the exposed plate interface zone has experienced flow and fracturing over an extended period of time followed by syncollisional exhumation, thus reflecting a multistage evolution. Fabric formation and metamorphism, however, chiefly record the deformation conditions of the precollisional setting along the plate interface. We identify an unstable slip domain from pseudotachylytes occurring in the temperature range between 200 and 300°C. This zone coincides with a domain of intense veining in the subduction mélange with mineral growth into open cavities, indicating fast, possibly seismic, rupture. Evidence for transient near-lithostatic fluid pressure as well as brittle fractures competing with mylonitic shear zones continues into the region below the occurrence of pseudotachylytes, possibly reflecting a zone of conditionally stable slip. The zone above the unstable slip area is devoid of veins but displays ample evidence of fluid-assisted processes similar to the deeper zone: solution-precipitation creep and dehydration reactions in the mélange matrix, hydration, and sealing of the base of the upper plate. Seismic rupture here is possibly expressed by ubiquitous localized deformation zones. We hypothesize that trenchward sealing of parts of the plate interface as well as reaction-enhanced destruction of upper plate permeability is an important component, localizing the unstable slip zone. This relation may result from the competition of the pervasive, presumably interseismic, pressure solution creep destroying permeability and building elevated fluid pressure until the strength threshold is reached with seismic failure.

The analytical heat diffusion models for most common micro-channel shapes are based on one-dimensional fin models with varying degrees of complexity. Because of a singularity in the governing one-dimensional heat diffusion equation for a fin with circular profile, no exact solution is possible for the circular heat sink geometry. In this paper, an alternative analytical power series solution technique is presented in which the differential equation is recast in polynomial form. Predictions of the power series solution are validated for different channel diameters and spacings and both one-sided and two-sided heating conditions using one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical simulations. Overall, maximum percent differences in temperature and heat transfer rate between the analytical and two-dimensional numerical results of 0.23% and 1.33%, respectively, prove that the present analytical models are very accurate and effective tools for the design and thermal resistance prediction of micro-channel heat sinks found in electronic cooling applications. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

This specifies the problem in terms of a set of algebraic equations which involves only the known scattering coefficients of an isolated cylinder, and certain series of elementary functions. The special results for normal incidence are identically those obtained originally by Ignatowsky who worked with the separation-of-variables solution; as a check we also extend his procedure to arbitrary angles and show that the results can be transformed to those we obtain by the Green&#039;s function approach. The equations are used to construct series and closed form approximations for both polarizations, for conducting and dielectric cylinders, for arbitrary angles of incidence. The results are applied to consider multiple scattering or coupling effects for a mode near grazing (Wood anomalies), and for closely spaced scatterers (packing effects). For example, we show that to a first approximation the packing effects for E perpendicular to the axes merely increase the dipole moment of the isolated cylinder; in this range, the circular cylinder within the grating is equivalent to an isolated elliptic cylinder whose size and shape are independent of angle of incidence. We also obtain simple closed forms for low frequencies which take explicit account of coupling effects up to multipoles of order 2^5, etc.",

The method of solution involves series expansion of incident and reflected SH waves from the cavity and two free surfaces in terms of cylindrical wave functions and the image method, respectively. The image method proposed in this article is used to satisfy the boundary condition of the traction free surfaces on the plate. Then, the boundary condition of the cavity is applied to the solution having unknown coefficients. In order to simplify the problem, only the lowest mode is taken into account in the plate. The results obtained in this study provide important information about the behaviour of the plate near the discontinuity. Numerical results show that the distance between the upper surface and the nearest cavity boundary (at θ=0,r=a) has primary effect. If the radius of the cavity is relatively small compared with the thickness of the plate, the solutions approach the full space&#039;s solutions for the cavity, well-known in literature. Also, those solutions for the plate correspond to the solutions of the plate without cavity. Dynamic stress concentration factors around the cavity and displacements in the cross-section of the plate are obtained near the cavity for various wave numbers. It is concluded that the presented solutions are partially analytical solutions, so they can be used for construction and verification of approximate numerical techniques such as the boundary element method (BEM), finite element method (FEM), finite difference method (FDM), etc.",

Four-node and 9-node shell elements are used to model both debond configurations. The stiffener flange and skin are modeled as two different layers of elements whose translational degrees-of-freedom, in the bonded portion, of the corresponding flange and skin nodes are constrained to be identical. Strain energy release rate formulae are presented for both 4-node and 9-node element models based on the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). In addition, average values of the strain energy release rates are calculated using a gradient method. The VCCT formulae and the gradient method are used to compute the strain energy release rates (G-values) for both debond configurations. The G-values predicted by these methods are compared with those predicted by plane-strain and 3D finite element analyses.

The analytical framework allows the water table to be located at any depth below the ground surface and variation of soil suction and moisture content above the water table under steady infiltration conditions. The framework also explicitly considers the effect of weathering and porosity increase near the ground surface on changes in the friction angle of the soil. The factor of safety is conceptualized as a function of the depth within the vadose zone and can be reduced to the classical analytical solution for subaerial infinite slopes in the saturated zone. Slope stability analyses with hypothetical sandy and silty soils are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the framework. These analyses indicate that for hillslopes of both sandy and silty soils, failure can occur above the water table under steady infiltration conditions, which is consistent with some field observations that cannot be predicted by the classical infinite slope theory. A case study of shallow slope failures of sandy colluvium on steep coastal hillslopes near Seattle, Washington, is presented to examine the predictive utility of the proposed framework.",

The aims of the use of the cross-corrugated absorbing plate and bottom plate is to enhance the turbulence and the heat-transfer rate inside the air flow channel, which are crucial to the improvement of efficiencies of solar air-heaters. To quantify the achievable improvements with the cross-corrugated absorbing and bottom plates, flat-plate solar air-heaters which have both a flat absorbing plate and a flat bottom plate, are also considered. The thermal performance of these three types of solar air-heaters are analyzed, measured and compared under several configurations and operating conditions. All the analytical and experimental results show that, although the thermal performance of the type 2 heater is just slightly superior to that of the type 1 heater, both of these cross-corrugated solar air-heaters have a much superior thermal performances to that of the flat-plate one. It is also found that the use of selected coatings on the absorbing plates of all the heaters considered can substantially enhance the thermal performances of the heaters, whereas such a selected coating on the bottom plates or/and the glass covers does not have such a significant effect on the thermal performances of the heaters. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the 3D solution, the dilute solution-based homogeneous model is adopted for the carbon nanotube (CNT)-reinforced nanocomposite considering FGVI and effective fibre modulus, in which the van der Waals-based cohesive law is adopted for the connection between CNT and the interphase. Parametric studies demonstrate that: (1) FGVI increases the composite stiffness, while it leads to the earlier debonding of the cohesive interface. (2) The peak strength of the macroscopic stress-strain is greatly influenced by the cohesive strength at the interface, higher cohesive strength leads to higher macroscopic peak strength. (3) The peak strength of the macroscopic stress-strain relation is underestimated without considering the effective fibre modulus, and the influence of the effective FGVI modulus is larger than that of the effective fibre. (4) CNTs of the large diameter bring the stress drop at a very small strain, especially for the large volume fraction of CNT. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

With the Green&#039;s function solution technique, the deflection of a circular plate with an arbitrary circular/ring electrode geometry is explicitly solved for axisymmetric vibration modes. For a PMUT with one center electrode covering ≈60% of the plate radius, the Green&#039;s function solution compares well with existing piece-wise and energy-based solutions with errors of less than 1%. The Green¿s function solution is also simpler than them requiring no numerical integration, and applies to any number of axisymmetric electrode geometries. Experimentally measured static deflection data collected from a fabricated piezoelectric micro ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) is further used to validate the Green&#039;s function model analysis. The center deflection and deflection profile data agree well with the Green&#039;s function solution over a range of applied bias voltages (5 to 21 V) with the average error between the experimental and Green&#039;s function data less than 9%.",

          "abstract": "The local resonances of an elastic plate with a free edge are investigated using laser ultrasonic techniques. It is known that the long wavelength vibrations of a plate can be interpreted in terms of Lamb modes. Low-frequency vibrations can be ascribed to the flexural A0 mode, while high-frequency shear or stretch vibrations occur at the cutoff of higher order Lamb modes. These thickness resonances correspond to an in-phase motion of the whole plate, associated to vanishing Lamb wave number. An elastic plate can also support local vibrations at nonzero values of the wave number for which Lamb mode dispersion curves undergo a minimum. Recently, experiments using laser ultrasonic techniques demonstrated that the local resonance of an infinite elastic plate is entirely governed by these zero group velocity (ZGV) Lamb modes. For a semi-infinite plate, ZGV modes can be observed at a distance as close as two thicknesses from the edge. Coming toward the edge, ZGV resonances slowly vanish, whereas the edge mode resonance appears, whose frequency depends on the thickness and on the bulk velocities of the plate. Using a laser excitation on the edge, the amplitude profile of the normal displacement of the edge was determined.",

The closed-form solution allows to describe the displacement of a rigid nugget when an axial orthogonal load is applied on the plate while plasticity and large deflections are present. The goal is to reach a reliable spot weld region model which can be used as the basis to develop a spot weld element in FE analysis even when plasticity and large deflections are in effect. The procedure is as completely original as no other can be found in the technical literature, and it has been applied to some examples of plates usually employed for spot weld analysis.

The energy release rate (G) was determined from stress intensity factors calculated from the crack flank displacements. The results show dominant mode III crack loading. The mode III component of the energy release rate (GIII) was nearly uniform along the central region of the crack front and mode II contribution was only significant near the load introduction and support pins. The measured and calculated compliance for the sandwich panels examined agreed reasonable.

The SMA wires were tested in the austenitic or martensitic states to study and decouple the elastic moduli from martensite transformation or reorientation stresses in the analysis of debond loads. The results reveal that the SMA wires that were in the austenite phase consistently produced higher debond loads as compared to that of those wires that started in the martensite phase, likely due to differences in the Poisson&#039;s ratio. Additionally, there appears to be a relationship between the elastic modulus and debond load where reinforcements with a higher elastic modulus displayed lower debond loads. Lastly, for SMA reinforcements that underwent a martensitic phase transformation or reorientation, the debond load was equivalent to the martensite transformation or reorientation load.

Here it is applied for the first time to solid mechanics. Von Kármán’s nonlinear plate equations are solved for uniform loading of a circular plate by expanding in powers of the maximum deflection to 110 terms. Analysis of the load-deflection series shows that convergence is limited by a non-physical square-root singularity. Mapping it away to infinity extends the range of convergence to infinity, and it is then possible to extract the asymptotic solution for extreme deflection, which agrees with the membrane solution.",

The beam is assumed to carry a torsional, a quasi-longitudinal and bending wave and the transmission is obtained with the help of the admittances of the beam and the plate. The analysis is restricted to the case of low frequencies but is otherwise general; thus due regard is given not only to the bending wave of the plate but also to the other propagating waves and to the local reactions. An interesting result from the study is that a bending wave on the beam will transfer a substantial part of its power into quasi-longitudinal and transverse waves in the plate, especially if the plate is thin compared with the beam. This is thought to be a factor that is important and not so easily quantifiable in the analysis of a complex structure. The local reactions on the other hand are of small importance for the power transmission from a torsional and quasi-longitudinal wave on the beam but may be important for the transmission of a bending wave, especially if the Young&#039;s modulus of the beam is larger than that of the plate. ?? 1985.",

This analysis provides also expressions for the global mode mixities.

Finite element modelling issues are first discussed, with particular attention on stress singularities in such beams and appropriate finite element meshes for the accurate determination of interfacial stresses. Finite element stresses are then carefully examined and compared with the predictions from a closed-form solution recently derived by the authors. The finite element results show that stresses vary strongly across the adhesive layer, with the stresses along the adhesive-to-concrete (AC) interface being very different from those along the plate-to-adhesive (PA) interface. In particular, near the end of the plate, the interfacial normal stress is tensile along the AC interface but compressive along the PA interface, offering a plausible explanation for the fact that PA interfacial failure in tests has rarely been if at all reported. The closed-form solution, being based on the assumption of uniform stresses in the thickness direction in the adhesive layer, is incapable of predicting such complex stresses, but nevertheless provides a reasonably close prediction of stresses along the middle-thickness section of the adhesive layer, particularly when the adhesive layer is not very thin. This and other similar closed-form solutions are therefore believed to still form a useful basis on which design rules against debonding failures can be built, with appropriate tuning using experimental data. Finally, the effect of spew fillets on interfacial stresses is examined. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

These crack-surface displacement equations are required for several reasons. For example, these solutions are useful to develop fracture analysis under monotonic load based on crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD). Also, these can be employed to develop the crack-closure models to study the growth of cracks originating from a hole under cyclic loading.",

Emphasis is given to the characterization of structural coupling and boundary conditions. These are incorporated into the model by means of continuous distributions of springs along the shell and the plate interface. A general formulation based on a variational principle is used. This formulation allows a wide spectrum of boundary conditions and coupling conditions between the shell and the plate, an issue the importance of which is clearly shown by a literature review. Very good accuracy of the method is demonstrated by solving test problems for lower order modes of the plate and of the shell, for which some results are available in the literature. Comparisons are also made using finite element analysis on a plate-ended shell, showing that the proposed approach is a convenient, effecient and accurate one for determining the modal behavior of such a complex structural system. Other numerical results are then presented for a shell rigidly attached to a plate, to illustrate the coupling phenomena between the shell and the plate. It is shown that there exist three different types of modes for this combined structure; they are termed plate-controlled modes, shell-controlled modes and strongly coupled modes, respectively. It is also shown that each type is closely related to the modal character of each of uncoupled elements. ?? 1992.",

This implies that the excitation may have an arbitrary lateral spatial distribution. The photoluminescence, probing the total minority-carrier content, turns out to be a nonexponential function of time when the surface/interface recombination velocity differs from zero. A practical method is developed to deduce accurate values of the bulk lifetime and the interface recombination velocity from such a nonexponential decay curve, based on a special way of plotting. Moreover, the analytical expressions are derived for the photoluminescence decay in the case of finite slab thicknesses and finite interface recombination velocities.

It allows to solve some complex 2D and 3D problems involving the specific thermal boundary conditions examined in this survey. Analytical solutions for fast transient conduction in infinite plate subject to sudden and violent thermal effects on its surface are presented in this paper. The numerical solutions are presented in the form of simple diagrams that can be easily and readily used in some engineering applications. These data are useful for the optimization of numerical codes in fluid mechanics in association with heat transfer and inverse methods for the determination of thermal characteristics of the surface phenomena in various cases. These diagrams are for specific ranges of Fo and Bi numbers corresponding to the fast transient problems characterized by low Fourier numbers, associated with a large combination of dimensions of the body and values of thermal surface conductance (large range of Bi). These diagrams constitute a substantial improvement (especially for violent and sudden thermal effects) of the well known Heisler&#039;s charts. A numerical solution is proposed. It overcomes the problems due to a too slow convergence. The main difficulty is encountered when solving characteristic equations based on a combination of the parameters involved in the particular equations of temperature and energy which may take asymptotic values for the specific phenomena addressed in this study. The results are successfully compared to those based on a different calculation procedure.

This simple, one dimensional problem allows computation of configurational volume forces analytically to validate the finite element (FE) results. The second example is Galin&#039;s problem that involves an infinite plate with a circular hole loaded by biaxial tension at the infinity. This is a two dimensional problem for which the analytical solution is known with some restrictions for elastic-ideally plastic case when Tresca yield criterion is considered.

For this, a new analytical solution is presented for plane stress state using von Mises yield criterion with a uniform shear loading along the boundary. R-, h-, and combined adaptive procedures are demonstrated on the above examples.

The relative importance of free convection due to gravity and forced convection due to viscosity is discussed, and a solution is obtained, with μr Tr, for the free convection current set up near a plate that is at rest in a gas at a temperature different from that of the plate, dissipation being neglected.",

Based on the technique of conformal mapping and the method of analytical continuation in conjunction with alternating technique, the solutions to plane elasticity problems for three dissimilar media are derived explicitly in a series form. For a limiting case when the thickness of the interphase layer is uniform, the derived analytical solutions of this paper are reduced to exactly the same results available in the literature. The image force acting on the dislocation is then determined by using the Peach–Koehler formula. It is found that the combination of material constants and nonuniformity of the interphase thickness will exert a significant influence on the dislocation force.",

The critical load for debond propagation is measured and is used with a fracture mechanics analysis to determine the interface fracture toughness. The analysis considers also friction between the fiber and matrix in the debonded region. To obtain the necessary data for calculation of residual radial stress at the F/M interface due to matrix cure shrinkage, simultaneous measurements of dynamic modulus and cure shrinkage were conducted on the matrix (vinylester) during cure.

This paper presents an analytic solution for circular logics in which the systems are linearly interrelated with each other. To formulate the analytic solution, the relations among systems in the fault tree structure are described by the Boolean equations. The solution is, then, obtained from the successive substitutions of the Boolean equations, which is equivalent to the attaching processes of interrelated system&#039;s fault tree to a given fault tree.

The rings are prevented from collapsing by rotation, and they create a field analogous to a dipole, with no net charge measured at infinity. They can have a regular horizon, and we show that this implies the existence of an infinite number of black rings, labeled by a continuous parameter, with the same mass and angular momentum as neutral black rings and black holes. We also discuss the solution for a rotating loop of fundamental string. We show how more general rings arise from intersections of branes with a regular horizon (even at extremality), closely related to the configurations that yield the four-dimensional black hole with four charges. We reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a large extremal ring through a microscopic calculation. Finally, we discuss some qualitative ideas for a microscopic understanding of neutral and dipole black rings.",

The accuracy and convergence of the present formulation are assessed on the basis of solutions corresponding to the special case of material isotropy; and one such existing, manually-derived, result is shown to be incorrect.",

Concrete lining and the surrounding rock mass were assumed as linearly elastic materials. Due to complexity of the problem for non-circular geometric configurations, complex variable method introduced by Muskhelishvili and conformal mapping functions were used to determine stress components within concrete lining and the surrounding rock mass. Finally, the solution was validated by ABAQUS finite element software through an example. Very good agreement was demonstrated between semi-analytical and numerical solution although some discrepancies were found at tunnel corners where large curvature existed. It was demonstrated that the solution predicted stress components more accurately around the tunnels, especially the corners with large stress concentration. Practical significance of the solution was placed in the fact that it could be used as a quick-solver with high accuracy. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Adding three denatured-protein spectra and one oligopeptide spectrum to 16 reference protein spectra markedly improved the correlation coefficients (r) between CD calculations and X-ray determinations for the unordered form and, to a lesser extent, for beta-turn, but the r-values for alpha-helix and beta-sheet decreased slightly. With 20 reference proteins the estimates of the unordered form of denatured proteins were significantly improved. Thus, we suggest that as a compromise the new set of reference proteins be used for estimating the changes in conformation for unfolding proteins. However, the current use of 16 reference native proteins appears to be adequate for CD analysis of native proteins and the expansion to 20 reference proteins including denatured ones may not enhance the analysis of native proteins.",

Three displacement components along with electrical potential field of the plate are expressed by a set of Chebyshev polynomials multiplied by geometry boundary functions. Both open-circuit and closed-circuit surface conditions are taken into account. The mechanical properties of the FG plates are assumed to vary continuously through the thickness of the plate and obey either exponent or power law distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents. The effect of thickness-to-radius ratio, inner-to-outer radius ratio, piezo-to-host thickness ratio and gradient index on the natural frequencies of coupled piezoelectric FG circular/annular plates is investigated for different electrical and mechanical boundary conditions. It is observed that, unlike isotropic homogeneous circular/annular plates, frequency parameters of their piezoelectric coupled FG counterparts significantly increase with an enhancement in the host plate thickness to radius ratio. Results also show that the frequency parameters for open-circuit condition are higher than those for closed-circuit condition. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Two types of imperfect interface, the spring-type interface with electromechanical coupling and the membrane-type interface, are considered. The former type is often used to model the electromechanical damage along the interface while the latter is largely employed to simulate surface/interface effect of nano-sized inhomogeneity. By using the Bessel function expansions, explicit solutions for the electromechanical fields induced by a time-harmonic anti-plane line force and line charge located in an unbounded matrix as well as the circular inhomogeneity are respectively derived. The present solutions can recover the anti-plane Green&#039;s functions for some special cases, such as the dynamic or quasi-static Green&#039;s functions of piezoelectricity with perfect interface as well as the dynamic or quasi-static Green&#039;s functions of pure elasticity with imperfect interface.

          "abstract": "In this work a technique for analyzing mixed mode delamination problems in laminated composite plates under general loading conditions is developed. The technique adopts the first-order shear deformable laminated plate theory and the interface methodology, which in turn is based on fracture and contact mechanics. In the thickness direction, an assembly of laminated plate and interfaces models the laminated structure. Delamination may occur along these interfaces, which otherwise perfectly connect the plate models by considering the limit case of interface stiffness coefficients approaching infinity. Lagrange and penalty methods are adopted in order to simulate adhesion and contact effects. Analytical expressions for total energy release rate and its mode components along the delamination front are given in terms of interface variables and of plate stress resultant discontinuities. By means of these expressions the influence of transverse shear on interface fracture analysis is investigated and comparisons with other plate-based delamination models adopted in the literature are established. Numerical results for the energy release rate distributions are given for typical mixed mode delamination problems by implementing the method in a 2D finite element analysis, which utilizes shear deformable plate elements and interface elements. Comparisons with full 3D finite element models show the accuracy and the computational efficiency of the proposed procedure. Some applications are proposed to point out the influence of delamination faces interaction on delamination analysis and the convergence of the mode partition procedure as the delamination front element size decreases, also when oscillatory singularities exist. On the basis of the latter result it transpires that the proposed interface model may represent the physical situation of a very thin adhesive layer. ?? 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.",

We first develop, using mechanical vibration theories, a mathematical model that simulates the output signals derived from sensors mounted on a physical surface such. Utilizing this model, we show that the profile of the output signals is unique not only in time but also in the frequency domain. We then exploit this important property to localize finger taps by developing a source localization algorithm based on infinite impulse response filter model for location template matching. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing approaches and verified both in a synthetic as well as a real environment for the localization of a finger tap on a touch interface.",

The goals of the study were to determine if early cementing of stems increased the debond energy of grit blasted stem-cement interfaces and if debond energy was dependent on mold type. Early (2 min) and late (6 min) times of cementation were considered for two different grit blasted surface finishes (16 and 60 grit, Ra=5.7 or 2.3 ??m). Specimen fabrication was performed using a relatively simple, unconstrained rectangular mold and a mold that more closely simulated in vivo conditions. The rectangular mold was used with all components at room temperature whereas the in vivo simulated mold had a body that resembled the femoral canal in shape and was warmed to body temperature. Early cementing did not increase the debond energy using the in vivo simulated mold. Extensive porosity was found at the interface, and porosity had a strong negative effect on debond energy. When the simpler, rectangular mold was used, early cementing did result in higher debond energies, but few voids were found at the interface. It appears that porosity at the interface was the major factor affecting the debond energy. The results from this study do not support the concept that improved stem-cement interface strength can be obtained by application of the cement while it is in a low viscosity state. ?? 2004 Orthopaedic Research Society.

It is also shown that antisymmetric vibrations (of the bending wave type) are usually of predominant importance for thin plates. Generally, the symmetric vibrations become more important for increasing wavenumbers.

Plane strain analyses are carried out for a doubly periodic array of circular cylindrical particles. The particles are taken to be rigid and the elastic-plastic deformations of the matrix are described in terms of continuum crystalline plasticity, using a planar crystal model that allows for three slip systems. Comparison is made with void-nucleation predictions based on a corresponding flow theory of plasticity with isotropic hardening. The crystal model can give rise to shear localization at the particle-matrix interface and shear localization, which leads to large localized strains in the matrix, is found to inhibit decohesion. The role of the triaxiality of the stress state in determining whether decohesion or localization occurs first is investigated. A parameteric study is also carried out for a crystal matrix using two descriptions of the interface shear behaviour; one is periodic in the shear displacement across the interface, while the other allows for shear decohesion.",

The UTST releases the shear-free condition on the top and bottom surfaces of plate which can be particularly useful when the plate is subjected to contact friction or presented in a flow field where the boundary layer shear stress is substantial. The solutions for deflections, force and moment resultants and critical buckling loads in bending and bucking analysis of functionally graded circular plates using UTST are presented in terms of the corresponding quantities of the homogeneous plates based on the classical plate theory (CPT). It is assumed that the non-homogeneous mechanical properties of plate, graded through the thickness, are described by a power function of the thickness coordinate. Resulting equations are employed to obtain the closed-form solutions.

The analysis is based on a solution of a complex singular integral equation with the unknown tractions at each circular boundary approximated by a truncated complex Fourier series.

Finite-element numerical models are used to extend the analysis to that of a power-law viscous matrix. The general behaviour of a deformable elliptical inclusion is not dramatically changed by power-law viscous rheology, but the effective viscosity is now a function of the orientation and axial ratio of the inclusion. Overall, the effect is similar to a markedly increased viscosity ratio for a stronger inclusion, or a decreased ratio for a weaker inclusion, when compared to the linear viscous case. As a result, rather low reference state viscosity ratios between inclusion and matrix (e.g., 2 to 3, determined at the same effective strain rate for both materials) can produce marked differences in behaviour for the range of power-law stress exponents established experimentally for many minerals and rocks (typically 3-6). Even for very high strain within a shear zone (?? &gt; 100), initially nearly circular inclusions (R &lt; 2) can maintain low axial ratios (R &lt; 2-3) and widely variable orientations.

Finite element models of symmetric three-point bend configurations are implemented in conjunction with a stiffness degradation method and the maximum tensile stress criteria to investigate the influence of debonding on crack tip parameters. The geometry considered is a single edge cracked beam having a symmetrically positioned stiff or soft cylindrical inclusion ahead of the crack tip. The numerical model is first validated by interferometric measurements on an edge cracked epoxy specimen with a glass inclusion. The measured quantities namely, the crack mouth opening displacement, crack mouth compliance, energy release rate, dominant strain, are all successfully captured by the adopted numerical methodology, before and after the inclusion debonds from the matrix. Subsequently, the effects of parameters such as the distance between the crack tip and inclusion center (L), the inclusion diameter (d), and the Young&#039;s modulus ratio between the inclusion and the matrix, are studied using the model. A stiff inclusion of constant (d/L) ratio debonds from the matrix at higher load levels when the inclusion interface is farther away from the crack tip. The increase in the crack driving force due to debonding is the highest when the inclusion proximity parameter ?? is approximately 0.4 and it decreases when ?? is increased or decreased relative to this value. However, when d/L ratio is varied, higher crack driving forces due to debonding are observed for larger size inclusions due to a greater loss of crack tip shielding and reinforcement. The influence of the modulus ratio (Ei/Em) due to debonding is most prominent in the range 0-1 for fixed d/L and ?? values. Additionally, a stiffer inclusion tends to debond from the matrix at lower loads for a constant interfacial strength. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Achieving the increasingly stringent\nperformance requirements for and strict restrictions size limitations\nhindered by strict weight restrictions size limitations, and subjected\nhostile environments. There has been considerable attention in\ndeveloping lightweight adaptive optics where piezoelectric sheet\nactuators are attached on the back of optical mirrors to achieve a high\nprecision surface shape with minimum additional weight. Vibration\ncontrol of such large flexible space structures is continually\nchallenging to engineers due to the large number of actuators and\nsensors and the large number of vibration modes within the operational\nbandwidth. For these structures, any disturbed modes are likely to\nremain vibrating for an extended period of time due to the small amount\nof damping available. As a result, controller spillover should be\nminimized as much as possible to avoid exciting the residual modes. In\nrecent investigations of circular plate shape control by {[}Philen and\nWang, Int. Soc. Opt. Eng. 4327, pp. 709-719]. It was demonstrated that\ndirectional decoupling of the two-dimensional actuator (meaning that the\nactuation in one of the two directions is eliminated) improves the\nsystem performance when correcting for the lower order Zernike static\ndeformations. This directional decoupling effect can be achieved through\nan active stiffener (AS) design. In this research, analytical and\nexperimental efforts are carried out to examine the effect of the active\nstiffener actuators in reducing the controller spillover through the\nstiffeners&#039; decoupling characteristics. It is shown that significant\nreductions in controller spillover can be achieved in systems using the\nactive stiffener actuators when compared to systems having direct\nattached (DA) actuators, thus resulting in improved vibration control\nperformance.

A visual analogue scale-based questionnaire was completed pre-debond to determine pain experience during treatment and expectations of pain during debond. The appliances were debonded and those in the wafer group bit on a soft acrylic wafer. A second questionnaire was completed post-debond to assess the pain experienced.\n\nRESULTS: Biting on an acrylic wafer significantly reduced the pain experienced when debonding the posterior teeth (P≤0·05). Thirty-nine per cent found the lower anterior teeth the most painful. The expected pain was significantly greater than that actually experienced (P≤0·0001). Greater pain during treatment correlated with increased expectations and increased actually experienced pain (P≤0·0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Biting on a soft acrylic wafer during debond of the posterior teeth reduces the pain experienced. The lower anterior teeth are the most painful. The pain expected is significantly greater than actually experienced.

The inclusion and matrix are linear elastic and isotropic, but have different elastic moduli, and a remote stress represents tectonic loading. A prescribed uniform strain within the inclusion accounts for inelastic compaction for a porosity change from 25to 10%. Differences in elastic moduli between the matrix and inclusion are based on laboratory data. We generalize earlier results, limited to 2D and axisymmetric geometries, by considering ellipsoids with different intermediate and greatest axial lengths, consistent with field observations.Stiffness contrasts and non-circular tip-line shapes produce modest concentrations of the remote stress, but compaction strains of 1-10% produce significant triaxial compressive stress concentrations, which presumably are responsible for band propagation. The plastic strain is triaxial, but dominated by the normal strain across the inclusion. The stress diminution on the band flank is easily overcome by minor increases in the tectonic loading, enabling bands to be closely spaced. For the shear-enhanced band, if the plastic shear and normal strains are approximately equal, the ratio of shear to normal stress is about 1.3 at the tip. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

The effects of tension-bending coupling and third-order shear deformation were included in these equations.

Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, we analyze stacked LFE waveforms and compare them with the waveforms of nearby earthquakes of known mechanism within the subducting Philippine Sea Plate. Analysis of both the focal mechanism using P-wave first-motions and the moment tensor using S waveforms indicates that LFEs represent shear slip on a low-angle thrust fault dipping to the northwest, namely the plate interface. Together with reports that deep tremor consists of a swarm of LFEs, our results suggest that deep tremor is generated directly by shear slip on the plate interface, and as such represents a seismic signature of the accompanying slow slip events.",

The presence of a shallow water table can lead to sustained water loss that is dependent on porous media hydraulic properties and water table depth among other factors. In this paper, an exact analytical solution to steady state evaporation from porous media is developed using the Brooks-Corey hydraulic conductivity model. The solution is presented in terms of a set of infinite series. An advantage of this solution compared to previous derivations is that the infinite series can be very closely approximated using a closed-form solution (i.e., excluding integrals or series). The novel solution shows excellent agreement with the exact solution for a broad range of soil texture from sand to clay. The applicability of the solution to predict the location of the drying front was also verified using experimental data taken from the literature. The solution may be used for directly modeling steady state evaporation or for inverse determination of the Brooks-Corey hydraulic parameters.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: To review the clinical and radiographic results of scaphoid excision and four-corner arthrodesis using a circular plate and screws compared with traditional fusion techniques (wires, staples, screws). Methods: Fifty-eight patients with four-corner arthrodesis (plate fixation, n = 27; traditional fixation, n = 31) were evaluated for radiographic and clinical success using wrist radiographs and functional assays. Patients were subjectively surveyed using the standardized Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire and classification scales for pain and satisfaction. Objective measurements included grip-strength and range-of-motion measurements. Results: Radiographic analysis showed 26% nonunion with loose hardware in the plate group compared with 3% in the traditional group and 22% hardware impingement in the plate group compared with 3% in the traditional group. Clinical evaluation yielded a mean grip strength of 31 kg (70% of opposite side) for plate fixation and 33 kg (79% of opposite side) for traditional fixation. The mean flexion-extension arc was 48% and 50% of the opposite wrist for plate and traditional patients, respectively. The mean adjusted Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire scores were 27 out of 100 for plate patients and 8 out of 100 for traditional patients. Pain classification scores showed that only 2 patients in the plate group were pain free whereas there were 8 patients in the traditional group who were pain free. Overall patient satisfaction was 60% for the plate group whereas the traditional patient group reported 100% satisfaction. Conclusions: The rate of major complications (nonunion or impingement) was much greater with circular plate fixation (48%) versus traditional fixation techniques (6%). With the plate procedure the grip strength and arc of motion decreased approximately 30% and 52%, respectively, compared with decreases of 21% and 50%, respectively, for traditional fusion methods. Additionally, subjective patient dissatisfaction was 40% in the plate group compared with 0% in the traditional group. We postulate that the increased complication and dissatisfaction rates associated with plate fixation may be attributable to possible biomechanical imperfections or increased technical demands with this fusion system.

The pMUT is modelled as a clamped, circular diaphragm consisting of a stack of structural and piezoelectric material actuated by an arbitrary number of circular electrodes. From classic plate theory, the equation of motion for axisymmetric bending is derived based on residual stress considering external pressure, voltage applied across the piezoelectric material, and electrode geometry. With Green&#039;s function, the equation of motion is analytically solved where the plate impedance shows a considerable increase in bandwidth and center deflection for a plate under compressive stress. The static zero-bias deflection of a microfabricated pMUT with a center electrode covering ≈60% of the plate radius agrees well with the model prediction. Based on the model and confirmed by experiment, it is suggested that an outer dummy electrode extending to the plate edge should be added to the pMUT design to prevent zero-bias deflection.",

Using a spring-mass model, the differential equations of motion corresponding to loading and unloading stages of impact are derived and solved numerically. Internal damage due to delamination is taken into account. Previously published analytical formulas 1,2 concerning the indentation of circular GLARE plates are used during the loading stages of impact. In this study, an equation for the unloading path is derived and used during the unloading impact stage. The load-time, position-time, velocity-time, and kinetic energy-time history responses are calculated. In this regard, the position where delamination occurs, the maximum plate deformation and the position where the impact load becomes zero are predicted. Also, the maximum impact load and the total impact duration are determined.

The shape of an abrupt interface between moving fresh water and stagnant saline water appearing at the bottom corner of the aquifer is determined in an explicit analytical form depending on the values of the incident flow, hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, its thickness, slope angle and densities of the two waters. The hodograph domain in this problem is an infinite curvilinear triangle. Its conformal mapping on an auxiliary half-plane and the mappings of the physical domain and a priori unknown complex potential domain are obtained by the method of PolubarinovaKochina based on the analytic theory of ordinary differential equations. The solution shows that, at small values of the incident flow, sea water intrudes deeply landward into the aquifer. Comparisons with special cases of a horizontal bottom and vertical beach are presented.",

The exact solutions for torsional vibrations in circular and annular plates are first reviewed. Then, an approximate method is developed to analyze torsional vibrations of circular plates with thickness steps. The method is based on an approximate plate theory for torsional vibrations derived from the variational principle following Mindlin&#039;s series expansion method. Approximate solutions for the zeroth- and first-order torsional modes in the circular plate with one thickness step are presented. It is found that, within a narrow frequency range, the first-order torsional modes can be trapped in the inner region where the thickness exceeds that of the outer region. The mode shapes clearly show that both the displacement and the stress amplitudes decay exponentially away from the thickness step. The existence and the number of the trapped first-order torsional modes in a circular mesa on an infinite plate are determined as functions of the normalized geometric parameters, which may serve as a guide for designing distributed torsional-mode resonators for sensing applications. Comparisons between the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements show close agreements in the resonance frequencies of trapped torsional modes.",

In this study, we present an analytical solution for a finite domain and a time-varying boundary condition. The solution was found using the Classic Integral Transform Technique (CITT) in combination with a filter function having separable space and time dependencies, implementation of the superposition principle, and using an algebraic transformation that changes the advection–dispersion equation for each species into a diffusion equation. The analytical solution was evaluated using a test case from the literature involving a four radionuclide decay chain. Results show that convergence is slower for advection-dominated transport problems. In all cases, the converged results were identical to those obtained with the previous solution for a semi-infinite domain, except near the exit boundary where differences were expected. Among other applications, the new solution should be useful for benchmarking numerical solutions because of the adoption of a finite spatial domain.",

Interval analysis methods are used to construct finite nonlinear, or mixed-integer nonlinear, reformulations of the original semi-infinite program under relatively mild assumptions on the problem structure. In certain cases the finite reformulation is exact and can be solved directly for the global minimum of the semi-infinite program (SIP). In the general case, this reformulation is over-constrained relative to the SIP, such that solving it yields a guaranteed feasible upper bound to the SIP solution. This upper bound can then be refined using a subdivision procedure which is shown to converge to the true SIP solution with finite e-optimality. In particular, the method is shown to converge for SIPs which do not satisfy regularity assumptions required by reduction-based methods, and for which certain points in the feasible set are subject to an infinite number of active constraints. Numerical results are presented for a number of problems in the SIP literature. The solutions obtained are compared to those identified by reduction-based methods, the relative performances of the nonlinear and mixed-integer nonlinear formulations are studied, and the use of different inclusion functions in the finite reformulation is investigated.",

We consider two general models for dynamic contact angle: the uncompensated Young force on the contact line depends on the capillary number in the form of either (1) a power law with exponent ?? or (2) a power series. By considering the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the velocity of the gas-liquid interface instead of the ODE for the interface position, we are able to derive new analytical solutions. For both dynamic contact angle models, we derive analytical solutions for the travel time of the gas-liquid interface as a function of interface velocity. The interface position as a function of time can be obtained through numerical integration. For the power law and ?? = 1 (an approximation of Cox&#039;s model for dynamic contact angle), we obtain an analytical solution for both interface position and velocity as a function of time. For the power law and ?? = 3, we can express the interface velocity as a function of time. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

The formation of inclusion complexes of RO-Subpc with beta-CD in DMSO and at the toluene/water interface was investigated by UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy, induced circular dichroism (ICD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Interfacial tension measurements suggested that beta-CD adsorbed as a monolayer at the toluene/water interface and probably orientated towards the toluene phase with its primary face. The 1:1 composition of beta-CD.RO-Subpc inclusion complexes was confirmed in DMSO and at the toluene/water interface for BzO-Subpc, PhO-Subpc, MeBzO-Subpc, and MePhO-Subpc. A 2:1 inclusion complex of AnO-Subpc formed in DMSO. The observed ICD spectra of beta-CDRO-Subpc inclusion complexes are discussed with respect to molecular modeling and the simulation based on Tinoco-Kirkwood theory. Interestingly, the ICD spectra of beta-CD.BzO-Subpc and beta-CD.MeBzO-Subpc inclusion complexes exhibited a negative sign in DMSO and a positive sign at the toluene/water interface. This reversal of the ICD sign strongly suggests a difference in the structure of the inclusion complexes: beta-CD at the interface formed the inclusion complex with its primary face, whereas the secondary face of beta-CD bound favorably to RO-Subpc in DMSO.",

In the scheme, the analytic solutions of 3D wave equations in cylindrical coordinates are employed. The vibration at any specific location on half-space medium is obtained analytically by a semi-infinite integration with respect to wave number k from 0 to ???. Because of decaying nature of integrand with respect to wave number k, the numerical integration can only be performed up to a certain upper limit ku instead of ??? without loosing accuracy. The choosing of the integration upper limit ku is dependent upon the factors of nondimensional vibration frequency and nondimensional distance between vibration source and receiving location. From the numerical results, one finds that some components of vibration on the surface may not attenuate monotonically along the distance from source. Some verification for the accuracy of the presented scheme will be made, and selected numerical results will be shown and discussed. Comments on the presented scheme will be given, and the presented scheme is proved to be effective and efficient for accurately predicting the vibrations on the surface induced by harmonic loadings applied at rigid circular plate. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Our solution relies on the Dupuit approximation and explicitly accounts for the buoyancy effects.

Commonly, the role of a trenchward moving continental plate for the growth of topography is neglected in both modelling and field studies. Instead, forces exerted by the downgoing plate on the continental plate as well as interplate coupling are thought to be responsible for the deformation of the upper plate. Our model set-up includes an oceanic plate, which is in contact with a continental plate along a frictional plate interface and driven by slab pull. Both lithospheres have an elasto-visco-plastic rheology. The models demonstrate that friction along the plate interface can only lead to a high topography if the upper plate is moving toward the trench. Without such a trenchward advance, no high topography is generated, as the upper plate subsides owing to the drag exerted by the subducting plate. Increasing the coefficient of friction only amplifies the drag and increases the amount of subsidence. Our findings imply that trenchward motion of the continental plate plays a key role for the development of mountain belts at convergent margins; subduction of an oceanic plate even with high interplate coupling cannot explain the formation of Andeantype orogens.",

E 23, 25 (2007)) that the c-director profile of a two-dimensional chiral smectic-C (SmC) film around a circular inclusion adopts dipolar rather than quadrupolar configuration observed in achiral SmC films. We give an analytical argument on how spontaneous bend inherent in chiral SmC liquid crystals influences the configuration of a SmC liquid crystal film around a circular inclusion imposing tangential anchoring. We find how the angle alpha between two surface defects seen from the center of the inclusion depends on the radius of the inclusion R and the strength of the spontaneous bend q . We show, however, that the contribution of the spontaneous bend to the free energy suffers from mathematical ambiguity; it depends on the mathematical treatment of the outer boundary even when it is at infinity. This might indicate that the shape as well as the treatment of the outer boundary of the film can significantly influence the equilibrium configuration of the c -director and the position of the surface defects.",

The benefits of this configuration are that &#039;antagonistic&#039; operation of SMAs on the plate allows the significantly longer cooling time constant of previously activated elements to be shortened by means of active elements working against them during that phase. This concept dramatically shortens the cooling time constant and brings it into the same order of magnitude of the heating phase. The paper examines the mathematical modelling of such a plate, and offers an approximate analytical solution by means of a hybrid WKB-Galerkin method. The antagonistic operation of the system is represented mathematically by terms in which the stiffness and damping are both time dependent. Therefore the equation of motion contains terms with time variant coefficients and is impossible to solve without recourse to specialised methods. Comparisons with numerical methods are given and it is shown that good similarity can be obtained for judicious choice of practical values for the time variant stiffness and damping functions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The electric and magnetic fields on excited ports are usually assumed to be isotropic. This assumption may not hold in certain scenarios such as vias in very close proximity, where anisotropic modes can be excited. This paper first extends voltage and current definitions of circular ports to account for the non-uniform field distribution along the port perimeter and the anisotropic propagating modes. The effect of these modes on the parallel-plate impedance can be captured in the contour integral method (CIM) by discretizing the port perimeter with line segments. However, the computation time grows rapidly as the number of modeled ports increases. Therefore, the CIM is extended here to incorporate analytical modal expressions to improve the computational efficiency based on the new port definition. The derivation starts with solutions under the assumption of infinite planes, and then is expanded to take finite plane boundaries into consideration. Application examples using the extended CIM will be demonstrated and validated against the conventional CIM with ports modeled numerically. The significance of anisotropic propagating modes for dense via arrays will also be discussed.",

          "abstract": "The moir?? hole drilling method in a biaxially loaded infinite plate in plane stress is an inverse problem that exhibits a dual nature: the first problem results from first drilling the circular hole and then applying the biaxial loads, while the other problem arises from doing the opposite, i.e., first applying the biaxial load and then drilling the circular hole. The first problem is hardly ever addressed in the literature but implies that either separation of stresses or material property identification may be achieved from interpreting the moir?? signature around the hole. The second is the well-known problem of determination of residual stresses from interpreting the moir?? fringe orders around the hole. This paper addresses these inverse problem solutions using the finite element method as the means to model the plate with a hole, rather than the typical approach using the Kirsch solution, and a least-squares optimization approach to resolve for the quantities of interest. To test the viability of the proposed method three numerical simulations and one experimental result in a finite width plate are used to illustrate the techniques. The results are found to be in excellent agreement. The simulations employ noisy data to test the robustness of this approach. The finite-element-method-based inverse problem approach employed in this paper has the potential for use in applications where the specimen shape and boundary conditions do not conform to symmetric or well-used shapes. Also, it is a first step in testing similar procedures in three-dimensional samples to assess the residual stresses in materials. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A solution for the finite-domain Eshelby-type inclusion problem of a finite elastic body containing an anti-plane strain inclusion of arbitrary cross-sectional shape prescribed with a uniform eigenstrain and a uniform eigenstrain gradient is derived in a general form using a simplified strain gradient elasticity theory (SSGET). The formulation is facilitated by an extended Betti&#039;s reciprocal theorem and an extended Somigliana&#039;s identity based on the SSGET and suitable for anti-plane strain problems. The disturbed displacement field is obtained in terms of the SSGET-based Green&#039;s function for an infinite anti-plane strain elastic body. The solution reduces to that of the infinite-domain anti-plane strain inclusion problem when the boundary effect is not considered. The problem of a circular cylindrical inclusion embedded concentrically in a finite cylindrical elastic matrix undergoing anti-plane strain deformations is analytically solved by applying the general solution, with the Eshelby tensor and its average over the circular cross section of the inclusion obtained in closed forms. This Eshelby tensor, being dependent on the position, inclusion size, matrix size, and a material length scale parameter, captures the inclusion size and boundary effects, unlike existing ones. It reduces to the classical linear elasticity-based Eshelby tensor for the circular cylindrical inclusion in an infinite matrix if both the strain gradient and boundary effects are suppressed. Numerical results quantitatively show that the inclusion size effect can be quite large when the inclusion is small and that the boundary effect can dominate when the inclusion volume fraction is high. However, the inclusion size effect is diminishing with the increase of the inclusion size, and the boundary effect is vanishing as the inclusion volume fraction becomes sufficiently low.?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a theoretical and experimental investigation of the scattering behavior of extensional and flexural plate waves by a cylindrical inhomogeneity. Exact solutions are obtained by using the wave function expansion method, while the Born first approximation has been employed to derive explicit solutions that form the basis for efficient parametric inversion and eigenfunction back-propagation. To verify the analytical methods, experiments have been performed on a metallic plate, with a cylindrical mass being bonded to one side of the plate to simulate damage. Circular piezoelectric transducers were surface mounted on the plate to generate and measure stress waves. A good correlation has been observed between the analytical solutions and the experimental data. The present results reveal that the scattering pattern is strongly dependent on the ratio of wavelength to the size of the inhomogeneity, indicating the importance of selecting the appropriate diagnostic frequency as well as the optimal placement of sensors to achieve maximum sensor response. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Empirical analyses of CD data rely on the availability of reference datasets comprised of far-UV CD spectra of proteins whose crystal structures have been determined. This paper reports on the creation of a new reference dataset which eﬀectively covers both secondary structure and fold space, and uses the higher information content available in synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectra to more accurately predict secondary structure than has been possible with existing reference datasets. It also examines the eﬀects of wavelength range, structural redundancy, and diﬀerent means of categorizing secondary structures on the accuracy of the analyses. In addition it describes a novel use of hierarchical cluster analyses to identify protein relatedness based on spectral properties alone. The databases are shown to be applicable in both conventional CD and SRCD spectroscopic analyses of proteins. Hence, by combining new bioinformatics and biophysical methods, a database has been produced that should have wide applicability as a tool for structural molecular biology.",

The numerical results of stress concentration factors are compared with analytical results and a satisfactory agreement is found. The mesh configurations and the finite/infinite element (FIE) interface locations are systematically varied to establish a numerical modelling criterion for the most effective use of this approach.

However, interfacial friction tends to stabilize the crack and increase the peak load as compared to a friction-free crack with the same interface toughness. Nevertheless, for a constant friction shear stress both the interface toughness and friction stress can be approximately determined from load vs. crack length or load vs. displacement hysteresis curves (including energy dissipation, residual displacement or compliance measurements). A friction-free crack is used as a reference solution, and friction is taken into account in the reduced crack-tip fiber load and debonded fiber elongation. When expressed in terms of these two quantities, the energy release rate and fiber end displacement are almost independent of the amount of friction.

All the kernels in the indirect formulation are expanded into degenerate form. By uniformly collocating points on the boundary, a linear algebraic system can be constructed. The direct searching approach is adopted to determine the natural frequency through singular value decomposition (SVD). After determining the unknown Fourier coefficients, the corresponding mode shape is obtained by using the indirect boundary integral formulations. The results of the annular plate, as a special case, are compared with the analytical solution to verify the validity of the present method. For the cases of circular plates with multiple circular holes, the results are also compared with those of finite element method (FEM) using ABAQUS. Besides, the effect of eccentricity of the hole on the natural frequencies is also considered. Good accuracy, high rate of convergence and computational efficiency are the main features of the present method due to the semi-analytical procedure. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Aquifers at natural coasts can also be influenced by tidal waves in nearby estuaries, resulting in a more complex behaviour of head fluctuations in the aquifers. We present an analytical solution to the two-dimensional depth-averaged groundwater flow equation for a semi-infinite aquifer subject to oscillating head conditions at the boundaries. The solution describes the tidal dynamics of a coastal aquifer that is adjacent to a cross-shore estuary. Both the effects of oceanic and estuarine tides on the aquifer are included in the solution. The analytical prediction of the head fluctuations is verified by comparison with numerical solutions computed using a standard finite-difference method. An essential feature of the present analytical solution is the interaction between the cross- and along-shore tidal waves in the aquifer area near the estuary&#039;s entry. As the distance from the estuary or coastline increases, the wave interaction is weakened and the aquifer response is reduced, respectively, to the one-dimensional solution for oceanic tides or the solution of Sun (Sun H.

In this study, a micro-indentation fiber push-out test was applied to measure the interfacial shear properties of a model TRISO-coated tube. Of particular emphasis is that this study developed a non-linear shear-lag model for a transversely isotropic composite material due to insufficiency in the existing isotropic models as applied to layered TRISO-coating systems. In the model, the effects of thermal residual stresses and the roughness-induced clamping stress were identified as particularly important. The rigorous model proposed in this study provides more reasonable data on two important interfacial parameters: the interfacial debond shear strength and the interfacial friction stress. The modified model coupled with experiments yields an interfacial debond shear strength of 240 ?? 40 MPa. This high interfacial strength, though slightly lower than that obtained by the existing isotropic model (???280 MPa), allows significant loads to be transferred between inner PyC and SiC in application. Additionally, an interfacial friction stress of 120 ?? 30 MPa was determined. This high friction stress is attributed primarily to the roughness at the cracked interface rather than clamping effects due to differing coefficients of thermal expansion.",

          "abstract": "We present an investigation of the acoustic scattering due to the presence of a flat plate in the vicinity of a turbulent subsonic jet. Experiments have been performed to measure changes in the velocity and sound fields for Mach numbers ranging from 0.4 to 0.6, and for distances between the plate and the jet axis ranging from 1 to 2 jet diameters. Results show only very slight changes in the mean flow induced by the plate, and no differences in the velocity fluctuation amplitudes on the jet centreline, suggesting that wave-packet models derived for jets without installation effects may be representative of the installed case, at least for the jet-plate distances considered here. The acoustic results, on the other hand, include a significant increase in the low-frequency sound radiation, and phase opposition between the shielded and unshielded sides of the plate. There is an exponential decay of the scattered sound with increasing jet-plate distance, suggesting that low-frequency radiation is due to the scattering of evanescent hydrodynamic wavepackets in the jet near field. To model this phenomenon, we calculate sound generation from wave-packet sources in two ways: on one hand we use a tailored Greens function that accounts for the presence of a semi-infinite, rigid flat plate; and, on the other, we solve numerically the Helmholtz equation, with boundary conditions representative of a finite flat plate, using a fast multipole boundary element method. In agreement with the experimental measurements, numerical calculations capture the phase opposition between shielded and unshielded sides, and the scattered sound depends exponentially on the position of the plate. This exponential dependence is related to non-compact effects associated with wavepackets, as compact sources would lead to an algebraic dependence. Acoustic pressure directivities computed for the finite and semi-infinite flat plates agree well where acoustic reflection and diffraction from the trailing edge of the plates are concerned. However, additional diffraction effects associated with the leading and lateral edges of the finite plate, and which take the form of multiple lobes in the directivity, are illustrated by the comparison. As the plate dimensions are increased, i.e. the Helmholtz number is increased, the solution approaches that obtained for the semi-infinite plate.",

This equation is linearized and transformed to the standard two-dimensional diffusion equation using a simple mapping function. The analytical solution is then obtained using Green&#039;s function. The solution thus obtained adds an additional term ?? to the damping and spring force expressions derived by Blech for compressible squeeze flow through non-perforated plates. This additional term contains several parameters related to perforations and rarefaction. Setting ?? = 0, one recovers Blech&#039;s formulae. We compute the squeeze film forces using these new formulae and compare the computed forces with the solution of 3D Navier-Stokes equation solved using ANSYS for different perforation ratios (ratio of hole to cell dimensions). The results match very well. The approximate limit of maximum frequencies under which the formulae give reasonable results is also discussed. Although the main result is derived for a rigid plate under transverse motion, we discuss the effect of flexibility of the structure by deriving results for a flexible plate under a specified set of boundary conditions and comparing the results with that of a suitably modified rigid plate result. For small amplitude motion, the results show that a suitably modified rigid plate model can capture the effect of flexibility through a simple scaling factor. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Reynolds numbers from about 50 to 4 104 were investigated. Different aspect ratios, at low blockage ratios, were achieved by varying the distance between circular end plates (end plate diameter ratios between 10 and 30). It was not possible, by using these end plates in uniform flow and at very large aspect ratios, to produce parallel shedding all over the laminar shedding regime. However, parallel shedding at around mid-span was observed throughout this regime in cases when there was a slight but symmetrical increase in the free-stream velocity towards both ends of the cylinder. At higher Re, the results at different aspect ratios were compared with those of a quasi-infinite cylinder and the required aspect ratio to reach conditions independent of this parameter, within the experimental uncertainties, are given. For instance, aspect ratios as large as L/D = 6070 were needed in the range Re approximate 4 103104. With the smallest relative end plate diameter and for aspect ratios smaller than 7, a bi-stable flow switching between regular vortex shedding and irregular flow was found at intermediate Reynolds number ranges in the subcritical regime (Re approximate 2 103).",

The inclusion and matrix are separated by a homogeneously imperfect interface that characterizes a spring type interaction between the elastic and electric interfacial boundary conditions. Furthermore, the boundary conditions for a mechanically compliant, weakly conducting and mechanically compliant, highly conducting interface are incorporated into the analysis. Using complex variable techniques the potential function inside the inclusion is formulated as a Faber Series expansion and a system of linear algebraic equations for a closed form solution is developed for the corresponding Faber coefficients under a finite number of terms. Under this approach, expressions for both the elastic and electric fields are developed for the inclusion and matrix. The results are presented in exact form for an elliptic inclusion and numerically simulated for a finite number of terms for purposes of verification. Additionally, the cases of a square and star inclusion geometry are analyzed and results are presented numerically. The results clearly demonstrate that not only is the stress distribution inside the inclusion interface non-uniform, but that the magnitude of the peak stresses are highly dependent on the inclusion shape and imperfect interface condition.",

The second part of this paper explores the use of equivalent linear soil properties in analytical solutions as an approximate way of simulating nonlinearity. The results of equivalent linear site response analyses are used as an input for the analytical solutions. The comparison of the analytical predictions with nonlinear numerical analysis results is very satisfactory.

The interface behavior is modeled from a thin interphase of constant thickness by taking a proper limit process. In the formulation the deformation of the thin interphase is approximated by the Kirchhoff-Love assumption of thin shell. To incorporate the higher-order interface stresses, we consider the bending effects resulting from the non-uniform surface stress across the layer thickness. The stress equilibrium conditions is fulfilled by consideration of balance for forces as well as stress couples. Depending on the difference in stiffness and length scales of the interphase, we show that the interfaces can be classified into four different types. This findings, upon suitable definitions of material parameters, agree with a rigorous asymptotic analysis proposed by Benveniste and Miloh [Benveniste, Y., Miloh, T., 2001. Imperfect soft and stiff interfaces in two-dimensional elasticity. Mech. Mater. 33 309-323]. To illustrate the higher-order effects, we derive analytically the stress concentration factor of an infinite plate containing a circular cavity with interface stresses of different orders subjected to a remote transverse shear loading. The closed-form expressions show how the orders of interface stresses influence the concentration factor in a successive manner. In addition, we examine the effective shear modulus of composites with circular inclusions with higher-order interface effects. The effective transverse shear modulus is derived based on the generalized self-consistent method. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brackets were bonded to human premolars with different etching protocols. In the control group (conventional method [CM]) teeth were etched with 37% phosphoric acid. In the study group, a self-etching primer (SEP; Transbond Plus Self Etching Primer; 3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) was applied as recommended by the manufacturer. Brackets were bonded with light-cure adhesive paste (Transbond XT; 3M Unitek) and light-cured for 20 seconds in both groups. The shear bond test was performed at the different debond times of 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes and 24 hours. RESULTS: Lowest SBS was attained with a debond time of 5 minutes for the CM group (9.51 MPa) and the SEP group (8.97 MPa). Highest SBS was obtained with a debond time of 24 hours for the CM group (16.82 MPa) and the SEP group (19.11 MPa). Statistically significant differences between the two groups were not observed for debond times of 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes. However, the SBS values obtained at 24 hours were significantly different (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Adequate SBS was obtained with self-etching primer during the first 60 minutes (5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes) when compared with the conventional method. It is reliable to load the bracket 5 minutes after bonding using self-etching primer (Transbond Plus) with the light-cure adhesive (Transbond XT).",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we establish sensitivity results that are relevant for imaging stiffness in tissue but may also be useful in other contexts. The data are the displacement at a single frequency throughout the imaging domain. The goal is to determine how the quantities -(1) amplitude of displacement, or alternatively (2) the displacement itself, the average displacement, the phase or the phase gradient-change within a homogeneous background. The results are easily interpreted formulas that show the dependence on the radius of the inclusion, the frequency and the stiffness contrast between the inclusion and the background. Our assumptions are: (1) the displacement satisfies the Helmholtz equation with the variable stiffness parameter; (2) the experiment produces a plane wave in the absence of any inclusions; (3) in {3D}, the inclusion is spherical; (4) in {2D} the inclusion is a circular disk; and alternatively in {3D} the inclusion is an infinite circular cylinder. Our method of analysis is to use series expansions of the solution expanded about the center of the inclusion.",

In the experiments, tin droplets (2.1 mm diameter) were formed and dropped onto a stainless steel surface whose temperature was varied from 25 to 240°C. Impact of droplets was photographed, and evolution of droplet spread diameter and liquid-solid contact angle measured from photographs. Substrate temperature variation under an impinging droplet wa:s measured. A complete numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations, based on a modified SOLA-VOF method, was used to model droplet deformation and solidification and heat transfer in the substrate. Measured values of liquid-solid contact angle were used as a boundary condition for the numerical model. The heat transfer coelficient at the droplet-substrate interface was estimated by matching numerical predictions of the variation of substrate temperature with measurements. Comparison of computer generated images of impacting droplets with photographs showed that the numerical model correctly modelled droplet shape during impact as it simultaneously deformed and solidified. A simple analytical model was developed to predict the maximum spread diameter of a droplet freezing during impact.",

          "abstract": "The aerodynamic forces on a flat plate accelerating from rest at fixed incidence in two-dimensional power-law flow are studied analytically and numerically. An inviscid approximation is made in which separation at the two plate edges is modelled by growing spiral vortex sheets, whose evolution is determined by the Birkhoff– Rott equation. A solution based on a similarity expansion is developed, valid when the scale of the separated vortex is much smaller than the plate dimension. The leading order is given by the well-known similarity growth of a vortex sheet from a semi-infinite flat plate, while equations at the second order describe the asymmetric sweeping effect of that component of the free-stream parallel to the plate. Owing to subtle cancellation, the unsteady vortex force exerted on the plate during the starting motion is independent of the sweeping effect and is determined by the similarity solution, to the order calculated. This gives a mechanism for dynamic stall based on a combination of unsteady vortex lift and pure added mass; the incidence angle for 1 maximum vortex lift is arccos√3/8≈52.2◦ independent of the acceleration profile. Circulation on the flat plate makes no direct contribution. Both lift and drag force predictions from the unsteady inviscid theory are compared with those obtained from numerical solutions of the two-dimensional unsteady Navier–Stokes equations for an ellipse of high aspect ratio, and with predictions of Wagner’s classical theory. There is good agreement with numerical results at high incidence and moderate Reynolds number. The force per unit span predicted by the vortex theory is evaluated for parameters typical of insect wings and is found to be in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. Estimates for the shed circulation and the size of the start-up vortices are also obtained. The significance of this flow as a mechanism for insect hovering flight is discussed.",

A finite element model is used to examine the flow potential distribution in a truncated bounded region close to the spherical cavity. In order to give an appropriate artificial boundary condition at the truncated boundary, a transient infinite element, that is developed to describe transient flow in the exterior unbounded domain, is coupled with the finite element model. The coupling procedure of the finite and infinite elements at their interface is described by means of the boundary integro-differential equation rather than through a matrix approach. Consequently, a Neumann boundary condition can be applied at the truncated boundary to ensure the C1-continuity of the solution at the truncated boundary. Numerical analyses indicate that the proposed finite element-infinite element coupling approach can generate a correct artificial truncated boundary condition to the finite element model for the unbounded flow transport problem.

The deformed configuration and volume are updated followed by the pressure update through the ideal gas law. The analytical solutions presented in the literature for this problem consider only the presence of small strains. In the present study the solutions given by Hencky, Fichter and Campbell are studied. A novel finite strain solution is derived, as an extension of Fichter׳s solution. The numerical solution is based on the finite element method and also considers finite strain kinematics. The results of numerical and analytical models for an enclosed circular membrane are compared, where the effects of small and finite strains with or without the consideration of the pressure–volume coupling are highlighted.",

It is shown that the scaling laws provide a good description of the flow behavior for start-up, transition and fully developed steady state.

The CD spectra of the J-aggregate of protonated 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin formed at the toluene/sulfuric acid interface in the rotating cell have been measured.

The plate can be laminated or consist of a continuously inhomogeneous material in the thickness direction. Two systems of problems of the plate under non-self-equilibrated loads are solved. The first is associated with discontinuous in-plane displacements and slopes, in-plane concentrated forces and out-of-plane concentrated moments. The second is associated with a transverse concentrated force. The Green functions for an infinite plate with a crack or an anticrack and the surface Green functions for an infinite plate with a crack are obtained in an exact closed form. The surface Green functions and associated stress resultants at any point throughout the line where the crack is located are presented in a real form. The intensity factor of membrane stress resultants and bending moments are obtained in a real form for the Griffith crack subjected to concentrated loads. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this study, an analytical approach is presented for the prediction of temperature during the solidification in a two-dimensional rectangular latent heat storage using a phase change material (PCM) with internal plate fins. The basic energy equation is formulated accounting for the presence of a heat thermal fluid (HTF) on the walls. A two-dimensional numerical model is developed based on the enthalpy method to predict the distribution temperature of the fin and solid-liquid interface in storage. Results from the analytical solution and numerical model show a good agreement. The developed analytical model estimates satisfactorily the solidification time of PCM in storage, which is useful in the design of PCM-based thermal energy storages and cooling systems. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

The solution allows for general radial- and time-dependent inlet/outlet conditions, complex boundary conditions on the duct wall including adsorption and decay, and arbitrary velocity profiles of the transporting fluid. The only numerical step of the solution is the inverse Laplace transform in the time variable. Therefore, the approach also produces fully analytical steady-state solutions. The solution is verified against computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations under various boundary conditions and velocity profiles (Newtonian and power-law), and in all cases good agreement is obtained. Although theoretically applicable to all regimes, the solution is computationally difficult at very high Peclet numbers and very early times due to numerical instabilities as a result of finite precision arithmetic of computers. A convergence analysis is conducted to delineate the boundaries of this limit for two important cases. The solution was derived using a new approach for solving two-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) with non-constant coefficients which parallels the Frobenius and power series methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The approach reduces the original PDE to a single infinite-order ODE with constant coefficients. The approach is suspected to provide solutions to a large class of PDEs of this type. The solution may find applications in a number of engineering and/or biomedical fields, it can be used to verify numerical simulators, and serve as a simple and easy-to-implement alternative where access to numerical simulators is not available. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The models predict the diffuse reflectance of both (i) semi-infinite homogeneous and (ii) two-layer media exposed to normal and collimated light. The two-layer medium consisted of a plane-parallel slab of finite thickness over a semi-infinite layer with identical index of refraction but different absorption and scattering properties. The model accounted for absorption and anisotropic scattering, as well as for internal reflection at the medium/air interface. All media were assumed to be nonemitting, strongly forward scattering, with indices of refraction between 1.00 and 1.44 and transport single-scattering albedos between 0.50 and 0.99. First, simple analytical expressions for the diffuse reflectance of the semi-infinite and two-layer media considered were derived using the two-flux approximation. Then, parameters appearing in the analytical expression previously derived were instead fitted to match results from more accurate Monte Carlo simulations. A single semiempirical parameter was sufficient to relate the diffuse reflectance to the radiative properties and thickness of the semi-infinite and two-layer media. The present model can be used for a wide range of applications including noninvasive diagnosis of biological tissue.",

So this study focuses on finding the natural frequency for isotropic composite plates with crack considering the size of the crack (crack length and depth through plate thickness) an crack position in the plate in x, y directions, also slant of the crack. The natural frequency is studied for composite material strengthen by powder, and short fibers with the effect of crack size and position, plate thickness, aspect ratio, the type of plate fixing where three type of fixing used (SSSS, SSCC, SSFF). Two methods are used to find the natural frequency of composite plate: First method is supposed analytical solution to solve the equation of motion considering the effect of size, and position crack on the natural frequency of the composite plate. Second method is finite element solution using ANSYS (ver. 14) program. A comparison made between the two methods and the error percentage is not exceeds of 3.5%. The results shows that the natural frequency decreases as crack size (length or width) increases. The natural frequency decreases when the crack in the middle of the plate over any position of the crack. The effect of crack when it reaches the middle is higher than when it&#039;s in the other places.

By using the complex potential function method, the image force and the stress intensity factor at the tip of the crack produced by the screw dislocation are obtained under an applied remote load. The results indicate that the shielding effect on the stress intensity factor due to the screw dislocation is enhanced (abated) by the negative (positive) interface stress, and increases (decrease) with an increase of the ratio of the shear modulus of the matrix over that of the inclusion (the relative length of the inclusion). The soft (stiff) inclusion promotes (suppresses) the crack extension. In addition, the surface of the nano-inclusion forms a tensional (compression) image force for the positive (negative) interface stress. It is also found that the interface stress generates strong size-dependence of the image force, comparing with the classical solution where this force is always constant. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These waves, which are first generated at the edges of the crack, travel along the surfaces and are diffracted/reflected at the opposite edge. By iteratively taking into account the contribution to the total field of these travelling waves, an infinite series with a known limit is constructed, leading to an approximate analytical solution for the case of a finite plane crack. This solution is virtually exact for large frequencies and it is very good for incoming wavelengths of up to four times the size of the crack.

For one item of the series of the load, we assume the distributions of the displacements in the radial direction and therefore only the distributions of the displacements in thickness direction are required to find.

It is assumed that the deformation due to a static transverse load is similar to that occurred in a low velocity impact. It is found that the model, despite its simplicity, is in good agreement with finite element (FE) predictions and experimental data for the deflection of the composite plate and gives a good estimate of the number of failed plies due to fibre breakage.

          "abstract": "Two current theories [11, 17] of interfacial debonding and fibre pull-out, which have been developed on the basis of fracture mechanics and shear strength criteria, respectively, are critically compared with experimental results of several composite systems. From the plots of partial debond stress, sdp, as a function of debond length, three different cases of the interfacial debond process can be identified, i.e. totally unstable, partially stable and totally stable. The stability of the debond process is governed not only by elastic constants, relative volume of fibre and matrix but more importantly by the nature of bonding at the interface and embedded fibre length,L. It is found that for the epoxy-based matrix composite systems, Gaoet al.&#039;s model [17] predicts the trend of maximum debond stress, sd*, very well for longL, but it always overestimates sd* for very shortL. In contrast, Hsueh&#039;s model [11] has the capability to predict sd* for shortL, but it often needs significant adjustment to the bond shear strength for a better fit of the experimental results for longL. For a ceramic-based matrix composite, sd* predicted by the two models agree exceptionally well with experiment over almost the whole range ofL, a reflection that the assumed stable debond process in theory is actually achieved in practice. With respect to the initial frictional pull-out stress, sf, the agreement between the two theories and experiments is excellent for all range ofL and all composite systems, suggesting that the solutions for sf proposed by the two models are essentially identical. Although Gaoet al.&#039;s model has the advantage to determine accurately the important interfacial properties such as residual clamping stress,qo, and coefficient of friction, µ, it needs some modifications if accurate predictions of sd* are sought for very shortL. These include varying interfacial fracture toughness,Gic with debond crack growth, unstable debonding for very shortL and inclusion of shear deformation in the matrix for the evaluation ofGic and fibre stress distribution. Hsueh&#039;s model may also be improved to obtain a better solution by including the effect of matrix axial stress existing at the debonded region on the frictionless debond stress, so.",

          "abstract": "Rigid splitter plates in the wake of bluff bodies are known to suppress the primary vortex shedding. In the present work, we experimentally study the problem of a flexible splitter plate in the wake of a circular cylinder. In this case, the splitter plate is free to continuously deform along its length due to the fluid forces acting on it; the flexural rigidity (EI) of the plate being an important parameter. Direct visualizations of the splitter plate motions, for very low values of flexural rigidity (EI), indicate periodic traveling wave type deformations of the splitter plate with maximum tip amplitudes of the order of 1 cylinder diameter. As the Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter is varied, two regimes of periodic splitter plate motions are found that are referred to as mode I and mode II, with a regime of aperiodic motions between them. The frequency of plate motions in both periodic modes is found to be close to the plane cylinder Strouhal number of about 0.2, while the average frequencies in the non-periodic regime are substantially lower. The measured normalized phase speed of the traveling wave for both periodic modes is also close to the convection speed of vortices in the plane cylinder wake. As the flexural rigidity of the plate (EI) is increased, the response of the plate was found to shift to the right when plotted with flow speed or Re. To better capture the effect of varying EI, we define and use a non-dimensional bending stiffness, K*, similar to the ones used in the flag flutter problem, K*=EI/(0.5??U2L3), where U is the free-stream velocity and L is the splitter plate length. Amplitude data for different EI cases when plotted against this parameter appear to collapse on to a single curve for a given splitter plate length. Measurements of the splitter plate motions for varying splitter plate lengths indicate that plates that are substantially larger than the formation length of the plane cylinder wake have similar responses, while shorter plates show significant differences. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The properties of the plate interface region influence plate coupling and rupture behaviour during large earthquakes. Plate coupling varies greatly along the Hikurangi subduction zone in the southern half of the North Island, New Zealand, and heterogeneous material properties can be examined with the well-recorded seismicity. For this study, we have used a modified velocity inversion to incorporate earthquake differential times from selected groups of distributed earthquakes, which improves the spatial resolution of features in the lower crust, and sharpens velocity gradients. Data are selected from temporary deployments and the permanent GeoNet network, which has expanded in the last decade. The resulting 3-D velocity model shows that the overlying plate exhibits patterns related to geologic terranes. The Rakaia terrane has low Vp/Vs and high Vp, and is spatially related to the zone of strong plate coupling. Seismicity occurs throughout the overlying plate, and extends to the plate interface without a lower crustal aseismic zone. The WairarapaWaewaepa fault zone may form the updip limit of strong coupling in future plate interface earthquakes. The crust of the subducting plate is characterized by abundant seismicity and is bounded by strong velocity gradients. Low-velocity zones above the plate interface are indicated from 30 to 50 km depth. Seismic velocities near the plate interface show an excellent correlation with the distribution of plate coupling, and provide insight into what controls such coupling. The plate interface has the highest Vp/Vs (&gt;1.85) and sharpest Vp/Vs gradient in the region of strongest coupling, consistent with the suggestion that strong coupling is related to the inability of fluid to cross the plate interface. In regions of recurrent slow slip, Vp/Vs is still high, but the gradient of Vp/Vs near the plate interface is much broader, suggesting movement of fluid across the plate interface. The area of deep slow slip corresponds to the most extensive high Vp/Vs mantle region above the slab.",

          "abstract": "Since the late seventies of the 20th century, several analytical models for combined heat and mass transfer in laminar falling film absorption have been proposed. Nevertheless the analytical solutions obtained with the Fourier method for the coupled process are complex and for short flow length a certain instability occurs which have been explained with the inconsistency of the initial and boundary conditions. Therefore boundary layer models have been justified in order to solve the transfer problem for short flow length. Moreover a linear approximation of the phase equilibrium is required. The analytical solutions for heat and mass transfer presented in this paper are obtained by using the Laplace transform to solve the partial differential equations for an isothermal as well as impermeable wall. An originally unknown constant temperature and mass fraction boundary condition at the interface are set. The temperature and mass fraction profile across the film are obtained formally independently. In order to determine the yet unknown interface temperature and mass fraction the phase equilibrium and the interface energy balance are applied, using averaged gradients with regard to the streamwise coordinate. The interface temperature and mass fraction obtained with this procedure are interpreted and treated as mean values. From the known evolution of the mean interface temperature and mass fraction, the local values are derived by inverting the first mean value theorem for integration. The results show very good agreement to the established analytical solutions. The solving procedure does not depend on the input parameters such as the Lewis number for instance, which is needed in order to determine the eigenvalues within the Fourier method. Moreover arbitrary correlations for the phase equilibrium are applicable. The present solution is mathematically stable and offer explicit expressions in order to calculate the mean heat and mass fluxes directly. Therefore this solution is favourable to implement entire absorption process simulation, yet describing the coupled heat and mass transfer process comprehensively.",

In the scattering matrix method, the amplitudes of the structural waves impinging on a junction are separated into incident, reflected, and transmitted components. The energy flow due to each of these waves is obtained using a wave impedance method, which is subsequently used to determine the transmission coefficient. Transmission coefficients for semi-infinite and finite L-shaped plates are investigated for single and multiple point force excitations, and for controlled incident wave sources. It is shown that the transmission coefficients can also be calculated from details of the modal transmission coefficients and the modal composition of the energy incident on the junction. Results show that the modal transmission coefficients are largely independent of whether the plates have finite or semi-infinite boundary conditions, and are only dependent on the details of the coupling. Finally, frequency averaged transmission coefficients are compared for semi-infinite and finite structures. In the cases considered, it is found that the semi-infinite system is a good approximation for finite systems after frequency averaging, especially if the system is excited with multiple point force excitation.",

Although particle motion is similar to that for radiation into air, the circulatory motion below the critical frequency still results in energy loss from the plate due to dissipation within the medium. As radiation is area dependent at all frequencies, a simpler model based on radiation from an infinite plate is also developed. This gives the same answer as radiation from a finite plate to leading order.

          "abstract": "A mathematical model is developed to investigate the effects of tidal fluctuations and leakage on the groundwater head of leaky confined aquifer extending an infinite distance under the sea. The leakages of the offshore and inland aquitards are two dominant factors controlling the groundwater fluctuation. The tidal influence distance from the coast decreases significantly with the dimensionless leakage of the inland aquitard (ui). The fluctuation of groundwater level in the inland part of the leaky confined aquifer increases significantly with the dimensionless leakage of the offshore aquitard (uo). The influence of the tidal propagation parameter of an unconfined aquifer on the head fluctuation of the leaky confined aquifer is comparatively conspicuous when ui is large and uo is small. In other words, ignoring water table fluctuation of the unconfined aquifer will give large errors in predicting the fluctuation, time lag, and tidal influence distance of the leaky confined aquifer for large ui and small uo. On the contrary, the influence of the tidal propagation parameter of a leaky confined aquifer on the head fluctuation of the leaky confined aquifer is large for large uo and small ui. ?? 2006.",

          "abstract": "The boundary integral equation (BIE) method is applied for the thermal analysis of fiber-reinforced composites, particularly the carbon-nanotube (CNT) composites, based on a rigid-line inclusion model. The steady state heat conduction equation is solved using the BIE in a two-dimensional infinite domain containing line inclusions which are assumed to have a much higher thermal conductivity (like CNTs) than that of the host medium. Thus the temperature along the length of a line inclusion can be assumed constant. In this way, each inclusion can be regarded as a ‘‘rigid line’’ (the opposite of a crack) in the medium. It is shown that, like the crack case, the hypersingular (derivative) BIE can be applied to model these rigid lines. The boundary element method (BEM), accelerated with the fast multipole method, is used to solve the established hypersingular BIE. Numerical examples with up to 10,000 rigid lines (with 1,000,000 equations), are successfully solved by the BEM code on a laptop computer. Effective thermal conductivity of fiber-reinforced composites are evalu-ated using the computed temperature and heat flux fields. These numerical results are compared with the analytical solution for a single inclusion case and with the experimental one reported in the literature for car-bon-nanotube composites for multiple inclusion cases. Good agreements are observed in both situations, which clearly demonstrates the potential of the developed approach in large-scale modeling of fiber-reinforced",

To facilitate recombinant production of such proteins for structural and engineering studies, we have produced circular messenger RNAs with infinite open reading frames. We show that a circular mRNA containing a simple green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame can direct GFP expression in Escherichia coli. A circular mRNA with an infinite GFP open reading frame produces extremely long protein chains, proving that bacterial ribosomes can internally initiate and repeatedly transit a circular mRNA. Only the monomeric forms of GFP produced from circular mRNA are fluorescent. Analysis of the translation initiation region shows that multiple sequences contribute to maximal translation from circular mRNA. This technology provides a unique means of producing a very long repeating-sequence protein, and may open the way for development of proteinaceous materials with novel properties.",

Seismic observations from small-aperture array data on the Olympic Peninsula of the Cascadia subduction zone show uncharacteristically stable linear particle motion coincident with the passage of tremor sources beneath the array. The azimuth of this horizontal ground motion matches expected polarizations from slip on the plate interface.

The effectiveness of this technique hinges heavily on the performance of the bond between the strengthening plate and the substrate, which has been the subject of many existing studies. In particular, the interfacial stresses between a beam and a soffit plate within the linear elastic range have been addressed by numerous analytical investigations. Surprisingly, none of these investigations has examined interfacial stresses in members with a curved soffit, despite that such members are often found in practice. This paper presents an analytical model for the interfacial stresses between a curved member of uniform section size and a thin plate bonded to its soffit. The governing differential equations for the interfacial shear and normal stresses are formulated and then solved with appropriate simplifying assumptions. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effect of the curvature of the member on the interfacial stress distributions in a simply supported curved beam for the two cases of a point load and a uniformly distributed load. The analytical solution is verified by comparing its predictions with those from a finite element model. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

As a first step a simplified stent architecture consisting of a bi-layered composite elastic arch is considered. The variations of normal and shear stress at the interface as functions of the boundary conditions at the base of the arch are explored. Depending on applied displacement and rotation, very distinct distributions of stress occur along the interface: dominant shear or dominant normal stress, compressive or tensile normal stress. A bi-layered composite elastic strut is then added to the composite elastic arch in order to create a realistic coated stent geometry. A displacement is applied to the bottom of the strut to simulate stent deployment. The addition of the strut is found to increase the normal stress and decrease the shear stress at all points on the interface. The influence of the various geometrical and material parameters on interface stress is explored using the analytical procedure developed in the paper, providing practical insight for stent-coating design. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The energy-harvesting structure is composed of a circular piezoelectric plate and a paralleled synchronized switch harvesting inductor (SSHI). A large capacitor is applied to store the energy scavenged by the piezoelectric structure. A full-bridge rectifier is employed to convert ac out from the piezoelectric structure to dc for storage.

The problem under consideration is a hydraulic fracture propagating in an infinite impermeable elastic medium under plane strain conditions. The fracture is driven by an incompressible Newtonian fluid injected, at a constant rate, from a source located at the center of the fracture. There are some differences between the two models in regard to the modeling of the near tip processes. The semi-analytical solution is built on the assumptions that the fracture is completely filled by the injection fluid and that the solid has zero toughness, while the numerical model explicitly accounts for the existence of a priori unknown lag between the fluid and crack front. It is shown that the numerical results exhibit self-similarity; in particular the predicted power law dependence on time of the net pressure, aperture and fracture length is well observed in the numerical results. Also, a very good agreement between the self-similar and the numerical solution is observed under conditions of &#039;small&#039; toughness. The results of this study actually suggest that the self-similar zero toughness solution is a good approximation to cases where the rock has a non-zero fracture toughness and a fluid lag develops, provided that the ratio θ of the rate of energy dissipation in the solid over the viscous dissipation in the fluid is less than 10-2.",

The objective of the paper is to predict time-dependent displacement of the tunnel wall, after stopping the excavation or after installing the support system. The rock mass is assumed to be isotropic and homogenous and incompressible. The tunnel is assumed to be circular and driven in a hydrostatic stress field. The rate of excavation is considered to be infinitely large. The Burger&#039;s body which is able to model the primary and secondary creep regions of the rock mass is applied.

In the domain, there can exists an interface across which the source term, the flux, and therefore the solution may be discontinuous. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are also discussed. To deal with the discontinuity in the source term and in the flux, the original problem is transformed to a new one with a smooth solution. Such a transformation can be carried out easily through an extension of the jumps along the normal direction if the interface is expressed as the zero level set of a three-dimensional function. An auxiliary sphere is used to separate the infinite region into an interior and exterior domain. The Kelvin&#039;s inversion is used to map the exterior domain into an interior domain. The two Poisson equations defined in the interior and the exterior written in spherical coordinates are solved simultaneously. By choosing the mesh size carefully and exploiting the fast Fourier transform, the resulting finite difference equations can be solved efficiently. The approach in dealing with the interface has also been used with the artificial boundary condition technique which truncates the infinite domain. Numerical results demonstrate second order accuracy of our algorithms. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The approach considers a polarized short pulse of light incident on the scattering medium, and uses an analytical cumulant solution of the vector radiative transfer equation with the phase matrix obtained from the Mie theory to calculate the temporal profile of scattered polarized photons for any position and any angle of detection. The general expression for the scattered photon distribution function is an expansion in spatial cumulants up to an arbitrary high order. Truncating the expansion at the second-order cumulant, a Gaussian analytical approximate expression for the temporal profile of scattered polarized photons is obtained, whose average center position and half width are always exact. The components of scattered light copolarized and cross polarized with that of the incident light can be calculated and used for determining the degree of polarization of the scattered light. The results show that circularly polarized light of the same helicity dominates the backscattered signal when scatterer size is larger than the wavelength of light. For the scatterers smaller than the wavelength, the light of opposite helicity makes the dominant contribution to the backscattered signal.

          "abstract": "This paper investigated the interaction of a piezoelectric screw dislocation with a nonuniformly coated circular inclusion in an unbounded piezoelectric matrix subjected to remote antiplane shear and electric fields. In addition to having a discontinuous displacement and a discontinuous electric potential across the slip plane, the dislocation is subjected to a line force and a line charge at the core. The alternating technique in conjunction with the method of analytical continuation is applied to derive the general solutions in an explicit series form. This approach has a clear advantage in deriving the solution to the heterogeneous problem in terms of the solution for the corresponding homogeneous problem. The presented series solutions have rapid convergence which is guaranteed numerically. The image force acting on the piezoelectric screw dislocation is calculated by using the generalized Peach-Koehler formula. The numerical results show that the varying thickness of the interphase layer will exert a significant influence on the shear stress and electric field within the circular inclusion, and on the direction and magnitude of the image force. This solution can be used as Green&#039;s function for the analysis of the corresponding piezoelectric matrix cracking problem. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

It is found that the stress and strain concentration factors of the finite thickness plate are different even if the plate is in elasticity state except at notch root of plate surface. The maximum stress and strain do not always occur on the mid plane of plate. They occur on the mid plane only in thin plate. The maximum stress and strain concentration factors are not on mid plane and the locations of maximum stress and strain concentration factors are different in thick plate. The maximum stress and strain concentration factors of notch root increase from their plane stress value to their peak values, then decrease gradually with increasing thickness and tend to each constant related to Poisson&#039;s ratio of plate, respectively. The stress and strain concentration factors at notch root of plate surface are the same and are the monotonic descent functions of thickness. Their values decrease rapidly and tend to each constant related to Poisson&#039;s ratio with plate thickness increasing. The difference between maximum and surface value of stress concentration factor is a monotonic ascent function of thickness. The thicker the plate is or the larger the Poisson&#039;s ratio is, the larger the difference is. The corresponding difference of strain concentration factor is similar to the one of stress concentration factor. But the difference magnitude of stress concentration factor is larger than that of strain concentration factor in same plate. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Subduction proceeds as thrust movements at the boundary between the subducting plate and the rigid overlying plate. At depth below this mechanically decoupling plate interface, the subducting plate couples with the overlying mantle, and flow is induced in the mantle wedge. This induced flow is the main factor that controls thermal structure under arcs. Depth of this decoupling to coupling transition at the plate interface is estimated from observed surface heat flow in the northeastern Japan arc using a two-dimensional numerical simulation of thermal structure. The estimated depth is about 70 km. The termination depth of thrust earthquakes agrees well with the depth of the coupling transition, which indicates that these earthquakes occur at the decoupling plate interface. The mechanism of this decoupling plate interface is discussed in this paper. It is believed that water associated with the subducting oceanic crust reduces the frictional stress at the plate interface and thrust movement thus becomes possible. Petrological studies show that dehydration reaction in the subducting oceanic crust terminate at about 2.0 GPa and have little temperature dependence. Termination depths of thrust earthquakes estimated from seismic studies are nearly the same (60 approximately 80 km) for various arcs. This indicates that depth of the decoupling to coupling transition is controlled by the termination depth of dehydration reaction in the subducting oceanic crust. Across-arc heat flow profiles observed in various subduction zones show similar features; heat flow is very low in the forearc region and increases steeply at the volcanic front. Considering that the depth of the slab is about 100 km at the volcanic front for various arcs, this heat flow feature is closely related to the depth of the slab. Thus it is concluded that thermal structure under arcs is mainly controlled by the depth of the pressure dependent dehydration reactions in the subducting oceanic crust.",

Both fully bonded (attached), and &quot;vented&quot; (no suction on rear face), anchors were considered. The current numerical results were compared with existing laboratory test data, finite-element results, and analytical solutions. This study showed that, in small strain analysis, the scatter of existing data was mainly due to the effect of soil stiffness. In large deformation analysis, when soil and anchor base were attached with suction, the pullout capacity factor formed a unique curve independent of the soil strength (s(u)), soil effective unit weight (gamma(&#039;)) and anchor size (B=width of strip anchor and D=diameter of circular anchor). The transitional embedment depth ratio, H-SD/B or H-SD/D, (where H-SD=transition depth between shallow and deep embedment) was 1.4 for a strip anchor and 0.75 for a circular anchor. The ultimate pullout capacity factors (N-c) for deep embedment were 11.6 and 11.7 for smooth and rough strip anchors and 13.1 and 13.7 for smooth and rough circular anchors, respectively. However, when the anchor base was vented, the soil stayed attached to the anchor base for deep embedment, and the pullout capacity was therefore the same as for the attached anchor. The separation depth ratio, H-s/B or H-s/D, (where H-s=embedment depth at which the soil and anchor base separated) was found to increase linearly with the normalized strength ratio, s(u)/gamma B-&#039; or s(u)/gamma D-&#039;.",

The turbulent eddies are replaced by a volume distribution of quadrupoles, and the reciprocal theorem used to transform the quadrupole scattering problem into one of the diffraction of a plane acoustic wave. This problem is solved by the Wiener–Hopf technique for the case when elastic forces in the plate are negligible, so that a local impedance condition relates the plate velocity to the pressure difference across the plate. Strong scattering of the near-field into propagating sound occurs when certain types of quadrupole lie sufficiently close to the plate edge, and we derive explicit expressions for the scattered fields in various cases. When fluid loading effects are small, and the plate relatively rigid, the results of Ffowcs Williams &amp; Hall (1970) are recovered, in particular the U5 law for radiated intensity. A quite different behaviour is found in the case of high fluid loading, when the plate appears to be relatively limp. The radiated intensity then increases with flow velocity U according to a U6 law. In aeronautical situations, surface compliance is negligible in its effect on the scattering process, and the U5 law must then apply provided the surface is sufficiently large. On the other hand, the effect of appreciable surface compliance is to greatly inhibit the near-field scattering from the surface edge. This weaker scattering is likely to be observed in underwater applications, where fluid loading effects are generally so high as to render unattainable the condition for a plate to be effectively rigid.",

          "abstract": "Loading and structural response models were developed to estimate the elastic deformation of a circular plate due to near field explosions. The loading model generates the nonuniform loading characteristic of a near field explosion on a circular plate. This loading model is unique as it uses the TNT equivalence factors for pressure and impulse separately when deriving the pressure profile. Most loading models either average the two factors together or use only one of them. An analytical model and two finite element models were developed to capture the response of the circular plate due to this nonuniform loading. The analytical model utilizes the von K??rm??n thin plate equations with a new assumed deformation profile. The typical deformation profile for a circular plate uses two constants to satisfy the boundary conditions. By adding torsional springs to the boundary of the plate and equating the springs&#039; moment to the plate&#039;s internal moment, as well as carrying through with the von K??rm??n model, a new assumed profile is derived which has one parameter representing the boundary. This allows for a sensitivity analysis to be performed on the boundary condition parameter. In addition, this parameter has physical meaning, as it represents the stiffness of the torsional springs. The plate center deflections for the three structural models were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The results show that the loading becomes less accurate at very small scaled distances because the loading model is more phenomenological than physics-based. The sensitivity of the maximum plate center deflection to parameter changes was estimated. The maximum deflection was found to be most sensitive to plate thickness. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The origin of our plate-consistent reference frame is the center of plate rotation (CP) rather than the center of mass of the entire Earth&#039;s system (CM) as in recent versions of ITRF. We estimate plate rotations and CP by minimizing the misfit between the horizontal velocities predicted by the plate model and the observed GPS velocities. If any version of ITRF is used as the reference frame, the drift of the ITRF origin relative to CP cannot be neglected in estimation of plate rotation vectors and plate-residual station velocities. The model of the plate kinematics presented here addresses the problem debated since the beginning of the space geodesy: how big are disagreements between the current plate motions and the motions averaged over several million years? We compare the vectors of relative plate rotations estimated here with the published vectors from GPS and geologic models. We also discuss the integrity of individual plates as exhibited by plate-residual station velocities. For seven largest plates, the RMS value of plate-residual station velocities in stable plate interiors is 0.5-0.9 mm/a; this value is an upper bound on deviation of real plates from infinite stiffness.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, a fast running crack in an elastic matrix with an inclusion is studied by using the time domain boundary element method (BEM). The bi-material system is divided into two parts along the interface between the inclusion and the matrix. Each part is linear, elastic, homogeneous and isotropic. For the crack surfaces, the non-hypersingular traction boundary integral equations are applied; while for the interface and external boundaries, traditional displacement boundary integral equations are used. In the numerical solution procedure, square root shape functions are adopted as to describe the proper asymptotic behavior in the vicinity of the crack-tips. The integrations over time are analytically computed via linear or constant temporal interpolation functions. The crack growth is modeled by adding new elements of constant length to the moving crack tip, which is controlled by the fracture criterion based on the maximum circumferential stress. The fracture criterion is evaluated to determine the direction and the speed of the crack advance in each time step. As an example, a rectangular plate with a pre-existing edged crack and a circular inclusion under the action of wedged impact loading is computed in details. The numerical results of the crack growth path, running speed, dynamic stress intensity factors (DSIFs) and dynamic interface tractions are presented for various material combinations and geometries. The effects of the inclusion on the fast crack propagation are discussed.",

The instrument is a design extension of a commercially available back scattering circular polarization (SCP) ROA spectrometer. Circular polarization of the incident beam is introduced with a quarter-wave plate, and a half-wave plate alternately positioned in and out of the beam controls the modulation between right circular polarization (RCP) or left circular polarization (LCP) states. Combining this modulation with the simultaneous detection of RCP and LCP scattered Raman radiation allows the measurement of incident circular polarization (ICP), SCP, in-phase dual circular polarization(DCPI) and out-of-phase DCPII-ROA. In addition, three different forms of backscattered Raman spectra, namely unpolarized, highly polarized, and depolarized Raman spectra, as well as a degree of circularity spectrum are obtained. The performance of the new all-CP ROA spectrometer is evaluated with neat α-pinene and aqueous hen lysozyme solution. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

The series solution developed in this study is not only very stable but also exhibits rapid convergence. To demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of the present method, several examples with various sector angles are selected and analyzed. Deflections and moments of example sector plates by the proposed solution are compared with those obtained by other analytical studies and then verified by numerical values evaluated by a commercial finite element analysis program, ABAQUS.

It is found that the maximum value of the recharging infiltration does not exceed the hydraulic conductivity allowing stating a criteria for recharge intervention to ensure the stability of the aquifer. In addition to the main results, two aspects of the water inflow are treated. These are the necessary modifications that are to be considered in the case of an inclined water table and in the case of a lined tunnel that develops a constant internal pressure. It is also found that under an inclined water table a tunnel may cease to drain on its complete circumferential edge and a limiting condition is stated.

Although the solution was first given, in cylindrical coordinates by Sneddon, it was part of a more general treatise on mixed boundary value problems and appears to be unknown to much of the physics community. We present here a dedicated derivation of the solution to the boundary value problem for parallel disks, in cylindrical coordinates. The resulting expressions for potential and capacitance are in closed form, but depend on a function f(t) which is determined from an integral equation of the Fredholm type, known as Love’s equation. By adopting an orthogonal series approach to the solution of Love’s equation, we have calculated the capacitance for a number of plate separation to plate radius ratios. A quantitative measure of the close plate approximation is then presented by comparing these values to those one would obtain using the elementary capacitanceequation ε0 A/d.",

The displacement degrees of freedom are assigned to each of the displacement nodes. The method is evaluated using the fully clamped and simply supported rectangular, circular and elliptic plates subjected to uniformly distributed transverse load as examples for which the exact results are given in the monograph of Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger.

Plates with eccentric square and circular openings are analyzed by this method using the full plate model and the results compare extremely well with those obtained by finite element methods.

The inhomogeneity and matrix have different material properties. The rate-dependent slip and mass transport by stress-driven diffusion concurrently occur on the inhomogeneity/matrix interface. For the remote uniform stress case, it is observed that the internal stresses within the inhomogeneity are quadratic functions of the coordinates x and y, and decay with two relaxation times. Interestingly the average mean stress within the circular inhomogeneity is in fact time-independent. As time approaches infinity, the internal stress field within the inhomogeneity becomes uniform and hydrostatic. In addition the change of strain energy due to the introduction of the circular elastic inhomogeneity is derived, containing various existing results as special cases. Furthermore, a simple condition leading to an internal uniform stress state within the inhomogeneity is found. This condition, which is independent of the elastic properties of the inhomogeneity and matrix, gives a simple relationship between the interface drag and diffusion parameters. For the remote heat flow case, the internal thermal stresses are linear functions of the coordinates x and y and decay only with a single relaxation time. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the obtained solution and the corresponding physics. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The splitter plate has a fixed length which is equal to the diameter of the cylinder, D = 50 mm. The effect of plate thickness, T, was examined using three plates with different thicknesses, T/D = 0.016, 0.04 and 0.08. The gap between the base of the cylinder and the leading edge of the splitter plate was increased successively from 0 to 100mm with 12.5mm increments. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the instantaneous velocity vector field in the wake region at Reynolds number Re = 5000 based on the cylinder diameter. The mean velocity vector field, corresponding vorticity field and streamline topology and turbulence statistics were obtained using 200 instantaneous images. The water height was kept constant at 25mm during the experiments. The splitter plate has a substantial effect on the suppression of the vortex shedding for the gap ratio (G/D) between 0 and 1.75D. For 1.75, the normalized Reynolds stress has a peak value of 0.0158, which is approximately 8.5 times smaller than the concentrations occurring for the bare cylinder.

Five-hundred-and-seven brackets were debonded using either bracket removing pliers or a lift off debonding instrument (LODI). By a system of random allocation contralateral opposing quadrants were debonded with a 0.019 x 0.025-inch archwire either in place or removed. After debond brackets were tested for slot closure by the fit of rectangular test wires from 0.016 x 0.022 to 0.021 x 0.025 inch in size. The LODI produced few slot closures sufficient to affect the fit of all but the largest test wire. Bracket removing pliers used after removal of the archwire produced significantly greater numbers of distorted brackets in response to testing with all but the largest wire. With the 0.021 x 0.025 inch wire in place the presence or absence of the archwire at the time of debond made no difference to the number of slot closures. Ten per cent of the brackets debonded using bracket removing pliers had distorted bases, no base damage was produced by the LODI. The use of bracket removing pliers at debond caused significantly more slot closures than use of the LODI. When bracket removing pliers are used the archwire should be left in place at the time of debond since this reduces the number of distortions.",

In this study, the main flow velocity, stream\nfunction of lateral velocities (secondary flows), and flow resistance\nratio in rectangular curved ducts are obtained analytically. The\neffect of duct curvature and aspect ratio on flow field is investigated\nas well.

The problem is shown to have an analytical solution for an arbitrary wave vector and frequency dependent bulk dielectric function ε(q,ω). The explicit surface energy-loss function and the surface plasmon dispersion relation are derived, which extend the conventional ones (Ls(ω)=-Im1/[ε(ω)+1] and ε(ω)=-1, respectively) to the spatially dispersive case. These solutions are applied to the models with hydrodynamic, Lindhard, and Lindhard-Mermin dielectric functions. The results obtained give the deeper insight into the analytical structure of the surface dielectric response, in particular, showing that the coupling of the bulk plasmon with a charge outside a solid corresponds not to a pole, as is the case for a charge inside a solid, but to the branching point singularity in the energy-loss function. Comparison with Ritchie-Marusak theory of specular reflection shows that while retaining all the advantages of an analytical solution, the diffuse scattering model yields the more realistic description of the dynamical response of metal surfaces. The results are illustrated by the application to the medium with aluminum parameters and discussed in conjunction with charged particles energy losses.",

          "abstract": "This paper addresses the interpretation of plate load tests bearing on double-layered systems formed by an artificially cemented compacted top soil layer (three different top layers have been studied) overlaying a compressible residual soil stratum. Applied pressure-settlement behavior is observed for tests carried out using circular steel plates ranging from 0.30 to 0.60 m diameter on top of 0.15 to 0.60-m-thick artificially cemented layers. The paper also stresses the need to express test results in terms of normalized pressure and settlement-i.e., as pressure normalized by pressure at 3% settlement (p/p(3%)) versus settlement-to-diameter (delta/D) ratio. In the range of H/D (where H=thickness of the treated layer and D=diameter of the foundation) studied, up to 2.0, the final failure modes observed in the field tests always involved punching through the top layer. In addition, the progressive failure processes in the compacted top layer always initiated by tensile fissures in the bottom of the layer. However, depending on the H/D ratio, the tensile cracking started in different positions. The footing bearing capacity analytical solution for layered cohesive-frictional soils appears to be quite adequate up to a H/D value of about 1.0. Finally, for a given project, combining Veacutesic&#039;s solution with results from one plate-loading test, it is possible (knowing of the demonstrated normalization of p/p(3%)-delta/D, where the pressure-relative settlement curves for different H/D ratios produce a single curve for all values of H/D) to estimate the pressure-settlement curves for footings of different sizes on different thicknesses of a cemented upper layer.",

Using a fourth-order shear deformation theory, the solutions for deflection and rotation functions of FG plates are presented in terms of the corresponding quantities for a homogeneous plate using the classical plate theory (CPT), from which solutions one can easily obtain the FOST solutions for axisymmetric bending of FG circular plates. It is assumed that the effective mechanical properties of the functionally graded plates through the thickness are continuous functions of the volume fractions of the constituent parts which are themselves defined by a power-law function. Numerical results for maximum deflection and shear stress are presented for various percentages of ceramic-metal volume fractions. These results are also compared with those obtained from the first-order shear deformation plate theory of Mindlin (FST), the third-order shear deformation plate theory of Reddy (TST) as well as the exact three-dimensional elasticity solution. It is found that although the maximum deflections obtained using FOST and TST are close to each other, the through-thickness shear stress is predicted more accurately by the FOST formulation than by the TST. ?? 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Our demonstrations are based upon a class of linear phase diagrams with constant coefficients in the four parabolic Fick equations involved. For a given set of coefficients it is found that couple terminal compositions that may lead to multiple velocities are confined to a zone close to the two-phase domain in the Gibbs isotherm. When the composition of one terminal point is fixed, a map can be drawn for the position of the other terminal point and this allows us to predict the multiplicity of the solution: single, double or triple. We show how this map is related to an interface instability map. As an application, multiple paths in the Zn-Ni-Cu system are predicted and compared with experiment. The difficult problem of removing the degeneracies is discussed.",

The literature review shows that almost all analytical models for adhesively bonded lap joints are two-dimensional. This is generally sufficient because the stresses in the width direction are significantly lower than in the direction of the loading. Most of the analyses are linear elastic for both adherends and adhesive because the inclusion of material non-linearity renders the solution too complex. As the degree of complexity and the number of stress components in the adhesive and the adherends increase, the initial analytical problem must be solved numerically. A summary of the main analyses is presented indicating the conditions of applicability and the stress components considered.

          "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the development of a numerical procedure for solving complex boundary value problems in plane elastostatics. This procedure - the displacement discontinuity method - consists simply of placing N displacement discontinuities of unknown magnitude along the boundaries of the region to be analyzed, then setting up and solving a system of algebraic equations to find the discontinuity values that produce prescribed boundary tractions or displacements. The method is illustrated by comparing computed results with the analytical solutions of two boundary value problems; a circular disc subjected to diametral compression, and a circular hole in an infinite plate under a uniaxial stress field. In both cases the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the exact solutions. In part II the displacement discontinuity method is generalized to incorporate automatically a traction-free boundary condition for a semi-infinite region. This modification makes the general displacement discontinuity method suitable for analyzing &#039;cavity-type&#039; problems for the elastic half-space.",

The method is based on the Green functions technique and the concept of the interior and exterior-point Eshelby tensors for an ellipsoidal inclusion. The proposed formulation is general and can be successfully applied to ellipsoidal coated inclusion in the case of anisotropic elasticity. For the particular case of spherical coated inclusion and isotropic behaviour, the exact analytic solution in terms of strain localisation tensors inside inclusion and in the coating is obtained. Using the generalized self-consistent scheme, we determine the effective elastic properties of a material containing spherical inclusions.

An asymptotic analysis for a plate with small-amplitude sinusoidal corrugations is carried out to first order with respect to the corrugation amplitude, and a boundary-value problem is formulated and solved by a shooting method to determine the meniscus shape and elevation of the contact line. The meniscus attached to a corrugated plate with rounded corners produced by a Schwarz-Christoffel mapping function for a triangular wave is considered by numerical methods. The Laplace-Young equation determining the meniscus shape is solved in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates generated by conformal mapping using a finite-difference method. The numerical results are successfully compared with the predictions of the perturbation expansion for small amplitudes and discussed with reference to the rise of a meniscus inside a dihedral angle for large amplitudes. A companion asymptotic analysis is presented for a meniscus outside a vertical circular cylinder with small-amplitude sinusoidal corrugations.

The pMUT is modelled as a clamped, circular diaphragm consisting of a stack of structural and piezoelectric material actuated by an arbitrary number of circular electrodes. From classic plate theory, the equation of motion for axisymmetric bending is derived based on residual stress considering external pressure, voltage applied across the piezoelectric material, and electrode geometry. With Green&#039;s function, the equation of motion is analytically solved where the plate impedance shows a considerable increase in bandwidth and center deflection for a plate under compressive stress. The static zero-bias deflection of a microfabricated pMUT with a center electrode covering ≈60% of the plate radius agrees well with the model prediction. Based on the model and confirmed by experiment, it is suggested that an outer dummy electrode extending to the plate edge should be added to the pMUT design to prevent zero-bias deflection.",

The experimentally determined debond length versus applied load was used as an input parameter in the finite element analysis of both stitched and unstitched configurations. The strain energy release rates at the debond front were calculated using plate elements. Discrete nonlinear spring elements were used to model the stitches and multipoint constraints were used to model the contact problem. Models of the unstitched configuration showed significant values of mode I and II strain energy release rates across the width of the joint and showed that mode III is zero at the centerline but increases near the free edge.

A 3D approach is used where the wave fields in the outer part outside the hole and in the inner part beneath the hole are expanded in the possible Lamb modes and the horizontally polarized shear modes. Both propagating modes and evanescent modes are included in the expansions. The expansion coefficients are obtained by utilizing the boundary conditions at the hole boundary and the continuity conditions below the hole. A linear system of equations for the expansion coefficients is obtained by projecting the different boundary conditions onto an orthogonal set of projection functions. A second approach is also presented, mainly for validation of the 3D model. This approach is based on the lowest order plate theories for extensional and flexural motion. Consequently, this model is only valid for very low frequencies. The two plate theories are combined and the wave fields in the different regions of the plate are obtained from the boundary conditions at the hole. Comparisons are made between the two different models for low frequencies and they show good agreement. A few examples are also given from the 3D model for higher frequencies where the plate theory model is not valid. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

This involves a solution of the reduced wave equation which does not satisfy the Sommerfeld radiation condition. The solution is obtained by requiring a geometrical-optics limiting condition as the wavelength λ goes to zero. Two cases of self-imaging are considered. The first case, called weak, deals with the faithful imaging of objects whose spatial frequencies are all much smaller than the (1/λ) value of the illuminating source. The conditions for this case demand that the two-dimensional Fourier spectrum of the object lies on the circles of a Fresnel zone plate. The second case, called strong, deals with the faithful imaging of objects for spatial frequencies up to the natural cutoff of 1/λ. Both doubly- and singly-periodic and nonperiodic objects are considered. For periodic objects the results are shown to agree well with the experimental and theoretical work to date, the latter of which has always employed the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction integral with the parabolic approximation appropriate to Fresnel diffraction.",

However, at moisture contents lower than the critical moisture content, the model predictions seem to overestimate the experimental results.

It is not easy to measure the temperature on the keyhole of electron-beam welding. Therefore it is essential to develop an analytical model that can accurately predict the temperature in the keyhole. In this study, the keyhole produced by an electron beam is assumed to be a paraboloid of revolution and the intensity of electron beam is supposed to be Gaussian profile. In order to obtain an analytical solution, the parabolic coordinate system is utilized to analyze the temperature in the keyhole and the parameter approximating convection is proposed to account for the effect of convection of molten metal. Considering the momentum balance at the bottom of the keyhole but neglecting the absorption in the plume, an analytical solution is developed for semi-infinite workpieces. As compared with other analytical solutions, the analytical solution obtained by this model provides the temperature distribution more consistent with the experimental data. The effects of various parameters on the temperature distribution in the keyhole are also discussed in this study.",

The use of graphene in nanoscale devices plays an important role in achieving more accurate and faster devices. Although there are lots of experimental studies in this area, there is a lack of analytical models. Quantum capacitance as one of the important properties of field effect transistors (FETs) is in our focus. The quantum capacitance of electrolyte-gated transistors (EGFETs) along with a relevant equivalent circuit is suggested in terms of Fermi velocity, carrier density, and fundamental physical quantities. The analytical model is compared with the experimental data and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is calculated to be 11.82. In order to decrease the error, a new function of E composed of α and β parameters is suggested. In another attempt, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is implemented for optimization and development of an analytical model to obtain a more accurate capacitance model. To further confirm this viewpoint, based on the given results, the accuracy of the optimized model is more than 97% which is in an acceptable range of accuracy.",

First, flow over a corner, whose vertex is either a stagnation point or point of infinite Darcian velocity, is analysed as a transition from one &quot;normal&quot; regime upstream to another downstream. The hodograph domain is a circular triangle, which is mapped onto a complex potential strip via an auxiliary half-plane. Parametric equations (backwater curves) for the phreatic surface are obtained. For the same flow problem, a depth-averaged 1-D nonlinear ODE for the thickness of the saturated zone (a generalized Dupuit-Fawer model) is numerically solved showing a perfect match with the potential (2-D) solution. Second, a non-planar aquifuge boundary is reconstructed as a streamline, along which an additional &quot;control&quot; boundary condition holds in the form of pore pressure as a function of an auxiliary variable (a relation between the hydraulic head and vertical Cartesian coordinate). The free surface is found in terms of Cauchy&#039;s integrals for the Zhukovskii function, with explicit integrations for selected &quot;controls&quot;. Third, a confined flow in a two-layered aquifer having a lens-type semi-circular inclusion in the subjacent stratum and incident velocity parallel to the interface between two aquifers is examined. The conjugation conditions along all four boundaries, across which the hydraulic conductivity jumps, are exactly met. The three velocity fields are explicitly presented, with examination of the flow net, including separatrices (&quot;capture zone&quot; boundaries), demarcating suction/barriering of the lens, and evaluation of the lens-induced cross-flow (commingling) between the two strata.",

The models presented depict expected trends in the behavior of both the force of adhesion and the interaction energy between different geometric configurations. These results are also used to demonstrate the impact of contact time on the adhesion force for cylindrical fibers in contact with a disk-shaped particle. After long time intervals where the disk-like particles have remained in contact with the cylinder, the adhesion force may lead to significant deformation of the attached particle. Hence, the adhesion force for a fourth geometric set which represents the most likely scenario for attached particles with long contact times is developed. As will be shown, this scenario results in the highest values of adhesion force and interaction energy. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.",

Bone cubes were obtained from different proximal regions of four resurfaced cadaveric tibiae. Three different porous-surfaced metal plates (one fiber mesh and two bead) and a smooth-surface metal plate were used. In the presence of a constant normal contact pressure (0.10, 0.15, or 0.25 MPa), a variable tangential load up to the maximum resistance of the interface was applied and both relative normal and tangential displacements were recorded. Repetitive and fatigue loadings were also considered. Measured results show that the interface friction curve is highly nonlinear, exhibiting large relative tangential displacements in the range of 50-400 microns before the maximum load is reached. Relative displacements in the normal direction remain below 10 microns. The maximum resistance in friction is independent of the bone excision site, type of porous-surfaced metal plate, magnitude of normal load, placement of bone cubes on metal plates or vice versa, repetition of applied load, and conservation period of bone cubes in saline solution. The smooth-surfaced metal plate has significantly smaller friction resistance than porous-coated ones. The fatigue loading of up to 4000 cycles at 1 Hz, in the presence of 0.25 MPa contact pressure, slightly decreases the interface friction coefficient. Finally, the initial secant stiffness of the interface at 75% of the maximum resistance load is found to be larger for the bone cubes from the lateral and medial regions and for the metal plate with smooth surface.",

Inclusion impact at the interface is considered under the concept of energy balance, with buoyancy forces, fluid dynamic forces, interfacial adhesion, and rebound forces determining whether the particle will pass through the interface or be retained by it. The effects of the inclusion, slag, and steel properties, as well as the effect of inclusion impact velocity, are considered at the interface. The interfacial tension between the slag and the inclusion should be smaller than that between the steel and the inclusion (negative wettability), so that the inclusions can pass into the slag layer and avoid re-entrainment. The inclusion particles that reach an equilibrium state at the steel-slag interface are subject to re-entrainment back into the steel, due to lift forces applied to them by the turbulent boundary layer at the interface. A removal criterion dependent upon the shear stress is introduced, and then the removal rates are calculated from the turbulent burst theory. It is found that the smaller diameter inclusions are trapped at the interface. Of the particles that remain at the interface, it is the larger ones that are more easily removed by the lift forces due to the turbulent shear stress. High slag viscosity is desirable, since it makes inclusion re-entrainment into the casting product more difficult.",

A new set of boundary conditions is proposed to improve the representation of the infinite flow domain, especially in the far wake area. It is shown that the resulting accuracy of the computed flow allows its use as a reference solution for code validation. This reference solution is reachable at any location up to 50 cylinder diameters far from the cylinder centre through spectral interpolation with a user-friendly script provided in appendix. It is shown how this solution offers the opportunity to perform a convergence study and to investigate the spatial distribution of numerical errors. The main goal of this study is to propose this reference solution as an helpful tool for numerical validation and development, especially for the improvement of immersed boundary methods toward high-order accuracy.",

The specific objective of the study was to examine the ways in which the user interfaces of social tagging systems encourage and provide users with features to assign, explore, browse and make use of tags during their interaction with social tagging sites. Design/methodology/approach – The user interface features and functionalities of ten social tagging sites (six social bookmarking and four social media sharing sites) are examined. A categorisation of tag-related features is developed for analysis. The sites are selected based on such criteria as popularity, variety of site type, and inclusion of tagging features and content type. Findings – The findings of this study show that there is an emerging interface design paradigm with respect to social tagging sites that reflects a particular focus on exploratory search and browsing features and services. Some of the key areas discussed are: user tagging features; exploratory and tag browsing features; and interface layout. Practical implications – The findings of this study of the user interface features of social tagging sites provide a comprehensive picture of the possible and potential features that can be incorporated into new social tagging systems. Based on the evidence found in the examined social tagging interfaces, recommendations are made on the design of tag posting, tag use, tag browsing, tag lists and tag clouds. The design recommendations offer ideas for the development of more sophisticated exploratory and interactive user interfaces for social tagging systems. Originality/value – This is the first paper that reports on a comparative and exploratory examination of social tagging user interface features and functionalities. Keywords",

There were two impingement plates manufactured with brass and stainless steel respectively used in the present study. The integrated effects of Reynolds number and equivalence ratio of the air/fuel jet, and distance between the nozzle and the plate (i.e. nozzle-to-plate distance) on heat transfer characteristics of the flame jet system had been investigated. The influence in using impingement plate with different thermal conductivities, surface emissivities and roughnesses on heat flux received by the plate was examined via comparison, which had not been reported in previous literatures. A higher resistance to heat transfer had been encountered when the stainless steel impingement plate of lower thermal conductivity was used, which led to a significantly lower heat flux at the stagnation region. However, the heat flux distribution in the wall-jet region of the plate was only slightly affected by using different impingement plates. Because of the significantly lower heat transfer, more fuel was not required to consume and existed at the stagnation region of the stainless steel impingement plate, which would be burned latter in the wall-jet region to release its chemical energy and enhance the local heat flux there. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of horizontal (G/D) and vertical (Z/D) distances between the cylinder and the plate on the near wake is studied via Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) in a water channel for Reynolds numbers of 200, 400 and 750, based on the cylinder diameter D. It is shown that the interaction of wake with the plate of length D can be categorized depending on the horizontal and the vertical distances between the cylinder and the plate. For the vertical distance range of Z/D a parts per thousand currency sign 0.7, there is a critical horizontal spacing before which the shear layers from the cylinder are inhibited to form vortices in front of the plate. Resulting elongated recirculation region between the plate and the cylinder suggests modification of the absolutely unstable near wake of free circular cylinder in favor of convective instability. Z/D = 0.9 provides a passage from Z/D a parts per thousand currency sign 0.7 to a parts per thousand yen1.1 and is associated with a dominant effect on the near-wake characteristics of interaction of shear layers from the cylinder with those from the downstream plate. For Z/D a parts per thousand yen 1.1, there is again, yet a smaller critical horizontal spacing after which vortices interact with decreased downstream plate interference. In this vertical separation distance range, a gap flow between the plate and the cylinder plays a determining role on the formation length and St number of vortices for small horizontal spacing values.",

These results are consistent with the slip mechanism of slow earthquakes, indicating that a locally serpentinized plate interface could trigger slow earthquakes, assisted by pore pressure build-up, whereas unaltered dry patches that remain strongly coupled are potential sites of regular earthquakes.",

          "abstract": "In the present paper, the stress field of an infinite bicrystal with a planar boundary that undergoes plastic distortion variations along the normal to its interface is first considered. It is shown that the stress field of the classic Eshelby-Kröner spherical inclusion problem can be retrieved by applying an appropriate superposition method to these bicrystal stress solutions. The methodology is explained for interior and exterior points (i.e.; inside and outside the inclusion). Such a superposition method provides a convenient geometrical interpretation of Eshelby-Kröner results. Besides, this method makes it also possible to handle spherical inclusion (or grain) problems with spatially non-uniform plastic strain in the inclusion. In particular, it is suited to handle easily intra-crystalline polynomial plastic strains with even exponents or any plastic strain that can be written as a power series representation with even exponents like cosx,coshx,sinxx,sinhxx. The analytical expression of the interior stress tensor for the problem of a plastic strain in the inclusion that varies as a power law with a general even exponent is given. Internal stresses and stored energy are also derived analytically for the problem of a plastic strain in the inclusion that varies as sinhrlrl (r being the polar distance to the inclusion centre and l a characteristic length), chosen to describe realistically the accumulated plastic strain gradients within grains. Remarkably, a tanh-shape is found for the evolution of the stored energy as a function of la in a log-log scale (a being the radius of the grain), resulting in very similar size effects as those derived from generalized continuum models. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides, we illustrate that even though a non-linear problem has one and only one solution, the sole solution might have an infinite number of expressions. Finally, to show the validity of the HAM, we apply it to give an explicit, purely analytic solution of the 2D laminar viscous flow over a semi-infinite flat plate. This explicit analytic solution is valid in the whole region η=[0,+∞) and can give, the first time in history (to our knowledge), an analytic value f″(0)=0.33206, which agrees very well with Howarth’s numerical result.

The present study has developed a relatively simple procedure to predict the interfacial performance of two bonded solid bodies using a simple beam theory and equilibrium conditions. It explicitly considers the interface slip effect on the structural performance. The results agree reasonably well with those from more complicated theories, finite element predictions and test measurements. Simplifications are proposed that do not sacrifice accuracy for beams of common proportions.

Unlike existing density-dependent model benchmarks, these problems have well-defined stability criteria that are determined analytically. These analytical stability indicators can be compared with numerical model results to test the ability of a code to accurately simulate buoyancy driven flow and diffusion. The basic analytical solution is for a horizontally infinite fluid-filled porous layer in which fluid density decreases with depth. The proposed test problems include unstable convection in an infinite horizontal box, in a finite horizontal box, and in an infinite inclined box. A dimensionless Rayleigh number incorporating properties of the fluid and the porous media determines the stability of the layer in each case. Testing the ability of numerical codes to match both the critical Rayleigh number at which convection occurs and the wavelength of convection cells is an addition to the benchmark problems currently in use. The proposed test problems are modelled in 2-D using the SUTRA [SUTRA-A model for saturated-unsaturated variable-density ground-water flow with solute or energy transport. US Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report, 02-4231, 2002. 250 p] density-dependent groundwater flow and solute transport code. For the case of an infinite horizontal box, SUTRA results show a distinct change from stable to unstable behaviour around the theoretical critical Rayleigh number of 4??2 and the simulated wavelength of unstable convection agrees with that predicted by the analytical solution. The effects of finite layer aspect ratio and inclination on stability indicators are also tested and numerical results are in excellent agreement with theoretical stability criteria and with numerical results previously reported in traditional fluid mechanics literature. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The duodecapole term in the potential is found to be absent when the ratio of pole diameter to throat diameter is 1.14511; the contributions from multipoles of higher order are found to be small. The method is extended to permit the calculation of the effects of placing the exciting coils near the poles, of allowing the permeability to be finite (but uniform), and of adding a yoke. THe distribution of flux density on a pole surface is calculated. It is recommended that circular arcs replace hyperbolic arcs as the basis for the design of quadrupole lenses. ?? 1971.",

It is shown that the solution for finite cylinders does not converge to the solution for infinitely long cylinders if the aspect ratio increases. This is due to differences in the treatment of diffraction for finite and infinite cylinders. (B) Finite cylinders have sharp edges, so their scattering properties differ from those of spheroids having the same aspect ratio. To illustrate these differences we present scattering matrix elements of cylinders and spheroids for a large set of aspect ratios. To handle the large amount of data, the scattering matrix elements as functions of aspect ratio and scattering angle are presented in so-called three-dimensional figures.",

          "abstract": "A model is presented for solute transport in rivers including transient storage in hyporheic zones. The model consists of an advection-dispersion equation for transport in the main channel with a sink term describing diffusive solute transfer to the hyporheic zone. This system of equations is solved analytically for instantaneous injection of a conservative tracer in an infinite uniform river reach with steady flow. The solution enables to estimate the temporal and spatial evolution of tracer concentrations downstream of the injection point with fewer parameters than any other model before. The solution is linked to a non-linear least squares optimisation algorithm to analyse breakthrough curves and estimate solute transport parameters. The model is applied to tracer experiments conducted in the Chill??n River, Chile, which were previously analysed with a model including mass exchange between the river and a stagnant storage zone. The fit between observations and model results is good, except for some experiments where the tailing of the fitted curves is more pronounced than observed. Estimates of the water flow velocity are practically identical with previous findings, but the estimates of the cross-sectional area and the dispersion coefficient are markedly different. Estimated values for the diffusion coefficient in the hyporheic zone agree with values cited in literature and with the magnitude of chemical diffusion coefficients in porous media. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "The paper presents a numerical method for solving the problem of an infinite, isotropic elastic plane containing a large number of randomly distributed circular elastic inclusions with uniform interphase layers. The bonds between the inclusions and the interphases as well as between the interphases and the matrix are assumed to be perfect. In general, the inclusions may have different elastic properties and sizes; the thicknesses of the interphases and their elastic properties are arbitrary. The analysis is based on a numerical solution of a complex singular integral equation with the unknown tractions at each circular boundary approximated by a truncated complex Fourier series. The Galerkin technique is used to obtain a system of linear algebraic equations. The resulting numerical method allows one to calculate the elastic fields everywhere in the matrix and inside the inclusions and the interphases. Using the assumption of macro-isotropic behavior in a plane section one can find the effective elastic moduli for an equivalent homogeneous material. The method can be viewed as an extension of our previous work (Int. J. Solids Struct. 39 (2002) 4723) where simpler spring-like interface conditions were modeled. The problem of overlapping of the fibers and matrix inherent to spring type interface is discussed in the context of the present model. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Using Kirchhoff thin plate theory, an axisymmetric ring is formulated, which takes into account geometric and material non-linearities as well as strain-rate effects. The fluid pressure field due to the fluid-structural interaction is calculated by solving the integral equations in the context of an element discretization method. Velocity function of the plate is interpolated by nodal velocity using Lagrange polynomials. The time-dependent solution of the coupled fluid-structure system is solved by applying a staggered solution algorithm at each time step in a direct time-integration procedure. To verify the method, results are compared with the hydro code LS-DYNA and good agreement is obtained. Furthermore, the influence of media density on the final deformation is analyzed. It is shown that the damping effect of the fluid reduces the deformation and stress of the plate greatly, especially for thin plates. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In order to improve the 1D solution, the end correction is also determined by using the 3D analytical approach. The effect of neck offset on the resonance frequency of circular asymmetric Helmholtz resonators is investigated. Predictions of resonance frequency and transmission loss from the present 3D and corrected 1D analytical approaches are, respectively, identical and close to the BEM results, while the corrected 1D approach provides a better accuracy compared to the 1D solutions with Ingard&#039;s correction.

          "abstract": "Using Fuji Prescale Pressure Sensitive Film we evaluated the influence of screw torque, object radius of curvature, mode of bone plate application (compression of neutral loading) and bone plate design on bone-plate interface mechanics. Testing was performed using 4.5 mm and 3.5 mm dynamic compression (DC) (stainless steel) and limited contact-dynamic compression (LC-DC) plates (titanium). Plexiglass tubing, having different radii of curvature, was used to simulate bone but having more uniform geometric and structural properties. With the film interposed between the bone plate and the plexiglass, bone plates were applied at predetermined levels of screw torque. The resultant image was digitized and then underwent computer-assisted analysis to yield the interface contact area (%) and the average force (in Newtons N) between the bone plate and the object to which it was applied. In any given object, screw torque had the most significant influence on both interface contact area (P = 0.0001) and average force (P = 0.0001) at the interface. The bone plates responded differently to dynamization. The DC plate, when applied in compression loading mode, was lifted off the object between the two central screws when compared to the same plate applied in neutral loading mode (P = 0.0001). Conversely, in the LC-DC plate, an increase in the overall interface contact area was observed when applied in compression loading mode (P = 0.0002). At a given level of applied screw torque, the object radius of curvature appeared to be a major determining factor for interface contact area and average force (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0001). We conclude that variables other than bone plate design also influence the interface contact area and average force between a bone plate and object to which it is applied.",

The fluid is assumed to be incompressible, inviscid and irrotational, and the effect of surface waves is neglected. An analytical-Ritz method is developed to study the vibratory characteristics of the plate in contact with the fluid. First of all, the exact expression of the motion of the fluid is obtained, in which the unknown coefficients are determined by using the method of separation of variables and the method of Fourier series expansion. Then, the Ritz approach is used to obtain the frequency equation of the system. The vibrating beam functions are adopted as the admissible functions for the wet-mode expansion of the plate, and the added virtual mass incremental (AVMI) matrices are obtained for plates with arbitrary boundary conditions. Finally, a convergence study is carried out and some numerical results are given. The accuracy of AVMI factor solutions is discussed by comparing with the more accurate analytical-Ritz solutions presented in this paper. Furthermore, It is seen that the present method is also suitable for the vibration analysis of rectangular plates in contact with infinite fluid by taking the finite, but larger size fluid domain as an approximation in the computation.

Remarkable effect of shear deformations of adherends has been noted in the results. Indeed, the resulting interfacial stresses concentrations are considerably smaller than those obtained by other models which neglect adherent shear deformations. It is shown that both the normal and shear stresses at the interface are influenced by the material and geometry parameters of the composite beam.

Early results of 4-corner arthrodesis with scaphoid excision using dorsal circular plate fixation are compared with reported results in the literature. Methods: We reviewed retrospectively the first 18 four-corner arthrodeses performed with this system by 4 hand surgeons. Two patients had revision surgery for nonunions before the study that were considered failures. Eight patients returned for final radiographs, objective examination, and functional questionnaire. The average follow-up period was 20 months (range, 13-33 mo). These results were compared with reported results in the literature using alternate fixation methods. Results: Radiographic union was achieved in only 3 wrists. Range of motion was 46% that of the opposite normal wrist and grip strength compared with the opposite wrist was 56%. Five patients would have the procedure again and 6 of 8 have returned to their original employment. Conclusions: Four-corner arthrodesis with scaphoid excision using a circular internal fixation plate produced a high number of nonunions. Grip strength and range of motion results also were inferior to those reported in the literature. Copyright ?? 2005 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.",

          "abstract": "Analytical solutions of contaminant transport in multi-dimensional media are significant for theoretical and practical purposes. However, due to the problems for which the solutions are sought which are complex in most of the cases, most available analytical solutions in multi-dimensional media are not given in their closed forms. Integrals are often included in the solution expressions, which may limit the practitioners to use the solutions. In addition, available multi-dimensional solutions for the third-type sources in bounded media are fairly limited. In this paper, a stepwise superposition approach for obtaining approximate multi-dimensional transport solutions is developed. The approach is based on the condition that the one-dimensional solution along the flow direction is known. The solutions are expressed in their closed forms without integrals. The transport media to the solutions are flexible and can be finite, semi-infinite, or infinite in the transverse directions. The solutions subject to the first- and third-type boundary conditions at the inlet with a distributed source over the domain are obtained. The integrals in some known solutions can also be evaluated by the approach if they can be derived to include known longitudinal integrals with respect to time. The accuracy and efficiency of the solutions proposed in this paper are verified through test problems and calculation examples. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

To ensure that the results are accurate and reliable, a global–local layerwise plate theory is employed instead of the traditional equivalent single-layer theories. The governing equations are derived based on Hamilton’s principle and solved using a Taylor transform whose center is located at the outer radius of the plate. Due to this hint, the resulting semi-analytical solution can be employed for both circular and annular sandwich plates. After investigation of vibration behavior of a single-layer annular auxetic plate, a comprehensive parametric study including evaluation of effects of the auxeticity for sandwich plates with isotropic and orthotropic face sheets, symmetric and asymmetric layups, different core to sheet thickness, radius to thickness, and inner to outer radius ratios, and various boundary conditions, is carried out. Results show that unlike the single-layer auxetic plates that exhibit a transition state, the auxeticity may considerably increase the natural frequencies and rigidities of the circular/annular sandwich plates, especially when the boundary conditions induce higher rigidity in the plate or when the fibers are along the radial direction. Accuracy of results of the employed layerwise theory and the proposed semi-analytical solution is verified by comparing the results with those of the three-dimensional theory of elasticity extracted from the ABAQUS software",

This classic solution is observed actually to be for uniform lateral loading because the radial component of the pressure acting on the deformed membrane is neglected. An algebraic error in Hencky&#039;s solution is corrected, additional terms are retained in the power series to assess convergence, and results are obtained for two additional values of Poisson&#039;s ratio. To evaluate the importance of the neglected radial component of the applied pressure, the problem is reformulated with this component included and is solved, with escalating algebraic complexity, by a similar power-series approach. The two solutions agree quite closely for lightly loaded membranes and diverge slowly as the load intensifies. Differences in maximum stresses and deflections are substantial only when stresses are very high. The more nearly spherical deflection shape of the membrane under true pressure loading suggests that a near-parabolic membrane reflector designed on the basis of the more convenient Hencky theory would not perform as well as expected. In addition, both theories are found to yield closed-form, nonuniform membrane-thickness distributions that produce parabolic middle-surface deflections under loading. Both distributions require that the circular boundary expand radially in amounts that depend on material and loading parameters.",

The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral for a plane circular curtain is solved analytically as fast-converging expansions, assuming an ideal continuous array, to speed up computations and provide insight. By reversing the time sequence of the recording (or reversing the direction of propagation of the incident wave so that the point source becomes an &quot;ideal&quot; point sink), the curtain becomes a time reversal mirror and the analytical solution for this is given simultaneously. In the case of an infinite planar array, it is demonstrated that either a monopole or dipole curtain will reproduce the diverging sound field of the point source on the far side.

All results are in a non-dimensional form and contain as few parameters as possible. Graphs and curves are added which provide results for any aluminium or steel plate coupled with water, whatever the subsonic velocity of loading.

In the proposed control design, the energy management problem, that by its very nature is a finite-time optimal control problem, is reformulated as a nonlinear-nonquadratic infinite-time optimization problem, leading to a family of state-feedback based control laws providing optimality with respect to an infinite time horizon performance functional while guarantee asymptotic stability. The analytical solution is obtained through a Lyapunov-based dissipative approach. The proposed optimal energy management control law is implemented in a pre-transmission parallel hybrid heavy duty truck and its performance is compared to the benchmark solution provided by the Pontryagin&#039;s Minimum Principle (PMP). Reduced computational efforts and lower sensitivity of the control parameter, while maintaining performances within 2% from the optimal value, makes the novel control design a breakthrough in energy management control research.",

The current paper presents new analytical results for CTOD for the through-the-thickness crack in infinite plates with various thicknesses. These results are based on a recently developed solution for an edge dislocation in infinite plate of arbitrary thickness. The analytical predictions of the CTOD and the constraint factor are compared with the three-dimensional FE results. It is shown that the analytical and the. numerical. results are in good agreement when the numerical calculations are-not affected by the size of the FE mesh and by the boundaries of the FE model.",

          "abstract": "The physics of a two-dimensional vortex dipole impinging on the tip of a semi-infinite rigid plate is numerically examined. The dipole trajectory is initially orthogonal to the plate and aligned with its tip. The impact behavior is examined for three dipole Reynolds numbers. As the dipole approaches, vorticity is induced along the plate, as in the case of a dipole approaching a full wall, and is additionally shed from the tip. Upon impact, the dipole effectively splits, with half of it interacting with the vorticity induced on the plate and the other half with the vorticity shed from the tip. Each half of the original dipole forms a new secondary vortex pair whose behavior depends upon the Reynolds number of the original dipole. Contingent upon the rate of momentum diffusion, these secondary (and tertiary) vortex pairs may return and impact the plate again. Herein, we detail the interaction of the dipole impact at various Reynolds numbers, with a focus on the vortex dynamics and the distributed load imposed on the rigid plate by the fluid.",

The closed-form solution is in the form of a double expansion, which is valid for distances from the observation point to the center of the source that are greater than its radius. However, for the remaining immediate near field, the King integral is solved using a combination of Gegenbauer&#039;s summation theorem and the Lommel expansion, resulting in a solution which is in the form of a triple expansion, reducing to a double expansion along the source&#039;s axis of symmetry. These relatively compact solutions in analytic form do,not require numerical integration and therefore present no numerical difficulties except for a singularity at the rim. As an example of a monopole source with an arbitrary velocity distribution, equations describing the radiation characteristics of a resilient disk in an infinite baffle are derived.

Such quakes occurred in 1853, 1900 and 1950, so another large earthquake had been anticipated1,2. Land-based Global Positioning System3,4 (GPS) and seismic5–7 measurements revealed a region where the plate interface was locked and hence accumulated seismic strain that could be released in future earthquakes. On 5 September 2012, the long- anticipated Nicoya earthquake occurred in the heart of the previously identified locked patch. Herewe report observations of coseismic deformation from GPS and geomorphic data along the Nicoya Peninsula and show that the magnitude 7.6 Nicoya earthquake ruptured the lateral and down-dip extent of the previously locked region of the plate interface.We also identify a previously locked part of the plate interface, located immediately offshore, that may not have slipped during the 2012 earthquake, where monitoring should continue.By pairing observations of the spatial extent of interseismic locking and subsequent coseismic rupture, we demonstrate the use of detailed near-field geodetic investigations during the late interseismic period for identifying future earthquake potential.",

Both phases are linear elastic but the interface traction-separation law is non-linear. A semi-analytical incremental model is developed which is suitable for any type of loading. For computational efficiency, the model relies on two simplifying assumptions: (i) the eigenstrain is uniform inside the inhomogeneity and (ii) the interface compliance is averaged over inhomogeneity&#039;s surface when computing the average strain within the inhomogeneity. An extensive parametric study is conducted for three loading modes and 144 combinations of non-dimensional parameters. The predictions are assessed against full-field finite element solutions based on two error measures of the mean stress field inside the inhomogeneity. The results show that the mean error value is acceptable in all cases and indicate the parameter ranges for which the model is most accurate. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The particle roughness is modeled as hemispherical asperities of fixed radius, in agreement with SEM micrographs of polystyrene latex spheres. The van der Waals energy is calculated using a pairwise summation technique for both nonretarded and retarded cases. The electrostatic energy is calculated using the linear superposition approximation and assuming the asperity-plate and particle-plate interactions are additive. We find that at large separations, the increased electrostatic repulsion produced by the roughness results in a shallower secondary potential well. At closer separations, however, the increased van der Waals attraction produces a dramatically lower repulsive barrier (as much as two orders of magnitude smaller in the example presented). This lower barrier would yield much larger capture rates than predicted by DLVO theory for smooth surfaces, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations.",

The wet dynamic displacement of the plate is approximated by combining the orthogonal modal functions of a dry circular plate with a clamped boundary condition. The liquid displacement potential satisfying the boundary conditions is derived and the wet dynamic modal functions of the plate are derived by using a compatibility requirement along the contacting surface between the plate and the liquid. The eigenvalue equation for the system is obtained by using the Rayleigh–Ritz method in order to calculate the wet natural frequencies and the mode shapes for the symmetric and the asymmetric modes.

A subsequent M L 5.5 earthquake in January 2005 occurred on a separate, deeper fault, sub-parallel to that of the 2004 swarm, but separated from it by about 1 km. This suggests a rapid decrease in mechanical damage in the slab with depth below the plate interface.

          "abstract": "A microscope was constructed for imaging circular dichroism of heterogeneous anisotropic media. To avoid linear biases that are common with electronic circular polarization modulation, we chose a retrogressive solution: mechanical light modulation by rotating a linear polarizer with respect to a quarter wave plate continuously tuned by tilting to the operating wavelength. Our comparatively slow technique succeeds with near-perfect circular input and signal averaging using a CCD camera. We have applied the method to anomalously birefringent crystals of 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone that are shown to have intergrown mirror image domains, undetected by X-ray diffraction because the twinning complexity renders differences in anomalous dispersion, already small, unreliable. The origin of the anomalous birefringence and the assignment of the absolute configuration are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Publisher Summary Plates and shells are a particular form of three-dimensional solid, the treatment of which presents no theoretical difficulties in the case of elasticity. The thickness of such structures is very small when compared with other dimensions. Their complete three-dimensional numerical treatment is costly and often leads to serious numerical ill-conditioning problems. To ease the solution, even long before numerical approaches became possible, several classical assumptions regarding the behavior of such structures were introduced. Such assumptions result in a series of approximations. Therefore, numerical treatment concerns itself with the approximation to an already approximate theory, the validity of which is restricted. The shape functions for rectangular elements are the simplest to form for thin plates. The thick-plate theory is simpler to implement in the finite element method; however, in the early days of analytical treatment, it presented more difficulties. This chapter discusses non-conforming shape functions. The solution with conforming shape functions give bounds to the energy of the correct solution; however, on many occasions, yields inferior accuracy to that achieved with non-conforming elements.",
