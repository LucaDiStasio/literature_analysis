          "abstract": "Natural fiber reinforced polymer composites are lightweight, economical and available in a variety of forms. They have low densities, comparable material properties, high molding flexibility and are environmentally friendly, making them a conceivable alternative to traditional fillers like mica, calcium carbonate and glass. By modifying either the resin system or the natural fiber, biocomposites can be designed for different applications ranging from products of commodity to aerospace, examples including electroactive papers, fuel cell membranes, controlled drug release mech- anisms and biosensors. This review aims to analyze the advancement in the application of cellulose based materials in different sectors with a discussion of fundamental research in these areas.",

          "abstract": "Use of eco friendly composites gains attraction due to its lightweight and moderate strength in the recent years. Palmyra fiber is a natural fiber obtained from Palmyra (Borassus flabellifer) tree. Mechanical properties of randomly mixed short fiber composites are studied and optimum fiber length and wt% are estimated. This paper deals with the properties of (randomly mixed) palmyra fiber, glass fiber hybrid composites. Two types of specimens are prepared, one by mixing the palmyra and glass fiber and the other by sandwiching palmyra fiber between the glass fiber mats. Composite plates are prepared for different palmyra/glass fiber weight ratio. Rooflite resin is used as matrix. Tensile, impact, shear and bending properties are studied. The mechanical properties of the composites are improved due to the addition of glass fiber along with palmyra fiber in the matrix. The glass fiber skin-palmyra fiber core construction exhibits better mechanical properties than dispersed construction. Moisture absorption studies are conducted and the results are presented as a function of square root of time. Addition of glass fiber with palmyra fiber in the matrix decreases the moisture absorption of the composites. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Composites of polypropylene (PP) reinforced with short glass fibers (SGF) and short carbon fibers (SCF) were prepared with extrusion compounding and injection molding techniques. The tensile properties of these composites were investigated. It was noted that an increase in fiber volume fraction led to a decrease in mean fiber length as observed previously. The relationship between mean fiber length and fiber volume fraction was described by a proper exponential function with an offset. The tensile strength and modulus of SGF/PP and SCF/PP composites were studied taking into account the combined effect of fiber volume fraction and mean fiber length. The results about the composite strength and modulus were interpreted using the modified rule of mixtures equations by introducing two fiber efficiency factors, respectively, for the composite strength and modulus. It was found that for both types of composites the fiber efficiency factors decreased with increasing fiber volume fraction and the more brittle fiber namely carbon fiber corresponded to the lower fiber efficiency factors than glass fiber. Meanwhile, it was noted that the fiber efficiency factor for the composite modulus was much higher than that for the composite strength. Moreover, it was observed that the tensile failure strain of the composites decreased with the increase of fiber volume fraction. An empirical but good relationship of the composite failure strain with fiber volume fraction, fiber length and fiber radius was established.",

The effect of stacking sequence and unidirectional glass fiber relative volume fraction (V fU/V fT) on the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of the manufactured composites has been investigated experimentally and theoretically. The laminates were fabricated by hand lay-up technique with 5 plies. Two non-hybrid composite laminates [R] 5 and [U] 5 were fabricated using the same fabrication technique for the comparison purpose. The average thickness of the manufactured laminates is 5.5 ?? 0.2 mm and the total fiber volume fraction (V fT) is 37%. Failure modes of all specimens were investigated. Experimental results indicated that the ILSS of [U] 5 is higher than those of hybrid and [R] 5 composite. Hybrid composites have higher ILSS than that of random composites.

The resulting material maintains structural integrity as is, providing a possible means of electrical power generation from a dynamically loaded structure. The hollow glass fibers are manufactured in-house using a bespoke fiber drawing facility. Hard magnetic powder materials are introduced into the hollow fiber cores to provide an active ferromagnetic function. The first part of this article discusses the ongoing work to manufacture, characterize, and optimize active magnetic fiber reinforced composite materials. Recent advances in smart material actuators have led to the development of piezoceramic ‘patches’ that utilize the piezoelectric effect of individual fibers encased in a protective environment. Previously, these patches have been either positioned on the surface or embedded within the structure, disrupting the composite lay-up. The second part of the article outlines a study of the feasibility of embedding piezoelectric fibers directly into a composite lay-up, thereby allowing a composite laminate to deform due to internal actuation. Potential improvements to the work have been identified and future work has been proposed to further understand and maximize the performance of integrated piezoelectric fiber composites.",

Advances of infrared, upconversion, and supercontinuum ZBLAN fiber lasers are addressed in detail. Finally, constraints on the power scaling of ZBLAN fiber lasers are analyzed and discussed.

These materials are presently limited by shrinkage and polymerization-induced shrinkage stress, limited toughness, the presence of unreacted monomer that remains following the polymerization, and several other factors. Fortunately, these materials have been the focus of a great deal of research in recent years with the goal of improving restoration performance by changing the initiation system, monomers, and fillers and their coupling agents, and by developing novel polymerization strategies. Here, we review the general characteristics of the polymerization reaction and recent approaches that have been taken to improve composite restorative performance.",

Methods: Five groups of FRC with increased fiber-density were fabricated and two additional groups were prepared by adding silanated barium-silicate glass fillers (0.7 ??m) to the FRC. The unidirectional E-glass fiber rovings were impregnated with light-polymerizable bisGMA-TEGDMA (50-50%) resin. The fibers were pulled through a cylindrical mold with an opening diameter of 4.2 mm, light cured for 40 s and post-cured at elevated temperature. The cylindrical specimens (n = 12) were conditioned at room temperature for 2 days before testing with the three-point bending test (Lloyd Instruments Ltd.) adapted to ISO 10477. Fiber-density was analyzed by combustion and gravimetric analyzes. Results: ANOVA analysis revealed that by increasing the vol.% fraction of E-glass fibers from 51.7% to 61.7% there was a change of 27% (p &lt; 0.05) in the modulus of elasticity, 34% (p &lt; 0.05) in the toughness, and 15% (p &lt; 0.05) in the load bearing capacity, while there was only 8% (p &lt; 0.05) increase in the flexural strength although it was statistically insignificant. The addition of particulate fillers did not improve the mechanical properties. Significance: This study showed that the properties of FRC could be improved by increasing fibervolume fraction. Modulus of elasticity, toughness, and load bearing capacity seem to follow the law of ratio of quantity of fibers and volume of the polymer matrix more precisely than flexural strength when high fiber-density is used. ?? 2010 Academy of Dental Materials.",

Finite element analysis (FEA) has been used to predict the fatigue life of composite drive shaft (CDS) using linear dynamic analysis for different stacking sequence. Experimental program on scaled woven fabric composite models was carried out to investigate the torsional stiffness. FEA results showed that the natural frequency increases with decreasing fiber orientation angles. The CDS has a reduction equal to 54.3% of its frequency when the orientation angle of carbon fibers at one layer, among other three glass ones, transformed from 0?? to 90??. On the other hand, the critical buckling torque has a peak value at 90?? and lowest at a range of 20-40?? when the angle of one or two layers in a hybrid or all layers in non-hybrid changed similarly. Experimentally, composite tubes of fiber orientation angles of ??45?? experience higher load carrying capacity and higher torsional stiffness. Specimens of carbon/epoxy or glass/epoxy composites with fiber orientation angles of ??45?? show catastrophic failure mode.

Starting from a measured distribution of fiber diameter, a Monte Carlo procedure was employed to generate periodic computer models with unit cells comprising of random dispersion of a hundred non-overlapping parallel fibers of different diameter. The morphology generated in this way showed excellent agreement with that of the actual composite studied. An ultrasonic velocity method was used to measure a complete set of composite elastic constants and those of the epoxy matrix. On the basis of periodic three-dimensional meshes, the composite elastic constants of the Monte Carlo models were calculated numerically. Numerical and measured elastic constants were in good agreement. It was shown numerically that the randomness of the composite microstructure had a significant influence on the transverse composite elastic constants while the effect of fiber diameter distribution was small and unimportant. The predictive potential of the Halpin-Tsai and some other models commonly employed for predicting the elastic behavior of undirectional composites was also assessed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Due to harsh growth conditions, the CNT-grafted fibers often exhibit degraded tensile properties. In the current study we explore an alternative approach to deliver CNTs to the fiber surface by dispersing CNTs in the fiber sizing formulation. This route takes advantage of the developed techniques for CNT dispersion in resins and introduces no damage to the fibers. We focus on unidirectional glass fiber/epoxy macro-composites where CNTs are introduced in three ways: (1) in the fiber sizing, (2) in the matrix and (3) in the fiber sizing and matrix simultaneously. Interfacial shear strength (IFSS) is investigated using single-fiber push-out microindentation. The results of the test reveal an increase of IFSS in all three cases. The maximum gain (over 90%) is achieved in the composite where CNTs are introduced solely in the fiber sizing. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

This paper deals with the mechanical properties of the composites made up of palmyra fiber waste [pfw] and the pfw/glass fiber hybrid composites. Composite plates were prepared with 30%, 38%, 45%, 50%, 58%, 65% and 70% wt of fiber, waste. Tensile, flexural, shear and impact properties were studied. Composites with 58-65-wt% fibers showed marginal improvement in flexural strength. Tensile strength was decreased and there was considerable improvement in shear and impact properties than that of resin. The properties of the natural fiber reinforced composites can be improved by hybridizing with high strength synthetic fibers such as glass. In this study, the palmyra fiber waste was hybridized with glass fiber in the polyester matrix. Samples were prepared by sandwiching the fiber waste between chopped strand glass fiber mats by varying both glass fibers and waste material content, keeping total fiber content as 60% by weight. Specimens were cut as per ASTM standards and tested in Instron universal testing machine. Mechanical properties of the composites were found to be increased with increase in the amount of glass fiber in the hybrid. Hybrid composites containing 48% waste, 10% glass fiber showed good reinforcement effect than the composites reinforced with 11 wt % glass fiber.

          "abstract": "Objectives: The visco-elastic behavior of a pre-impregnated reinforced glass fiber composite (everStick??) was compared with a resin-based particulate composite (Filtek??? P60) by using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to determine their storage modulus (E???) and damping ratio (tan ??). Methods: These materials were subjected to three-point bend tests using a PerkinElmer DMA7. In temperature mode, the temperature was increased from 26 to 140 ??C at 1 Hz. In frequency mode, the range was 1-10 Hz at a constant temperature of 37 ??C. Results: In both temperature and frequency modes, E??? for everStick?? was significantly higher and tan ?? was significantly lower than those for Filtek??? P60, indicating that the stiffness of the pre-impregnated glass fiber composite was higher and its damping property was lower than those for resin-based particulate composite. Significance: The glass fiber restorative composite appears to absorb less energy in repeated stress and is less likely to retain external energy as residual stress. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.",

          "abstract": "Objective Although metal implants have successfully been used for decades, devices made out of metals do not meet all clinical requirements, for example, metal objects may interfere with some new medical imaging systems, while their stiffness also differs from natural bone and may cause stress-shielding and over-loading of bone. Methods Peer-review articles and other scientific literature were reviewed for providing up-dated information how fiber-reinforced composites and bioactive glass can be utilized in implantology. Results There has been a lot of development in the field of composite material research, which has focused to a large extent on biodegradable composites. However, it has become evident that biostable composites may also have several clinical benefits. Fiber reinforced composites containing bioactive glasses are relatively new types of biomaterials in the field of implantology. Biostable glass fibers are responsible for the load-bearing capacity of the implant, while the dissolution of the bioactive glass particles supports bone bonding and provides antimicrobial properties for the implant. These kinds of combination materials have been used clinically in cranioplasty implants and they have been investigated also as oral and orthopedic implants. Significance The present knowledge suggests that by combining glass fiber-reinforced composite with particles of bioactive glass can be used in cranial implants and that the combination of materials may have potential use also as other types of bone replacing and repairing implants.",

This paper presents an experimental study of using carbon nanofibers (CNF) to improve the interlaminar fracture properties of polyester/glass fiber composites. Surfactant-treated CNF were dispersed in polyester resin and then the CNF-resin suspension was infused to impregnate a glass fiber preform using vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM). The manufacturability of using VARTM for thick and large CNF toughened composite parts has been experimentally investigated. The influence of CNF concentration on the CNF filtration in the glass fiber preform, the resin viscosity, and the micro-void formation has been examined. By choosing appropriate manufacturing parameters, we were able to use VARTM process to infuse the surfactant-treated CNF/resin matrix into the glass fiber preform and successfully manufactured the CNF toughened polyester/glass fiber composite specimens for mode-I delamination tests. The critical energy release rates of mode-I delamination (GIC) were characterized for several composite specimens with 1 wt% CNF concentrations and for those with pure resin. Significant improvement in the GIC was consistently observed as 1 wt% CNF were added to toughen the polyester resin. Microscopy pictures showed that the fracture surfaces of the 1 wt% CNF toughened polyester/glass fiber composite samples were more complex than the fracture surfaces of regular polyester/glass fiber composites. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The experimental results are used for the validation of the results obtained by simulation using ANSYS software. The finite element (FE) model based on representative area element (RAE) approach is implemented in the finite element code ANSYS. The comparative analysis gives an acceptable error, indicating applicability of such simulation model studies in predicting material characteristics in advance. The elastic modulus evaluated both by Halpin-Tsai model and FE model are more close to experimental results as compared to the results obtained from rule-of-mixture. Similarly, the tensile strength of the composites evaluated both experimentally and by finite element method (FEM) shows close resemblance. An empirical relationship has been developed and reported for the calculation of effective thermal conductivity for two-phase composite system (i.e. fiber and matrix interface). It is observed that the order of composites with effective thermal conductivity is 45 wt.% glass fiber based composite &gt;35 wt.% glass fiber based composite &gt;25 wt.% glass fiber based composite &gt;15 wt.% glass fiber based composite. The magnitude increases slightly in case of 45 wt.% glass fiber based composite, whereas it remains almost constant in case of 35 wt.% and shows slightly decrease in case of 25 wt.% and 15 wt.% glass fiber based composites.

          "abstract": "Bamboo fibers are an abundant natural material with mechanical properties comparable with those of glass fibers that are commonly used in fiber reinforced plastic composites. Bamboo fibers stand out from the group of natural fibers due to the fast growing and high yield of this plant. The advantage of bamboo fibers is in their high specific stiffness, high strength, low weight, low cost, biodegradability, non-abrasive nature and sound absorption. There is available considerable amount of studies on bamboo fiber reinforced composites especially fiber-reinforced thermoplastic polymers (polypropylene, polyethylene, polylactic acid and polybutylene succinate) and fiber reinforced thermosetting resins (polyvinylchloride, polyester, novolac, epoxy resins). In recent years researchers have focused on biodegradable composites made out of natural fibers and bio-resins. Investigations were carried out on bamboo fiber filled natural rubber composites and on properties of chemically modified soy protein resin reinforced by bamboo fibers. Resin on base of corn starch blended with bamboo fibers was also investigated as a fully biodegradable material. In an effort to solve problems with industry wastes the study on epoxy resin filled with bamboo fibers and red mud was made. Red mud is solid waste which remains after refining bauxite in process of fabrication of aluminum. Applications of bamboo fibers reinforcing cement, concrete and mortar matrix were also investigated. Results of all the above mentioned studies of applications of bamboo fibers reveal the suitability of bamboo fiber reinforced composites for non-structural applications as for example furniture, wall boards and panels, and other low-bearing components. However there are still problems such as poor resistance to moisture absorption, high heterogeneity in fiber properties, poor compatibility between bamboo fibers and polymer matrix caused by different polar nature of these materials. The present paper discusses recent advances and studies on bamboo fiber reinforced composites and reviews, as well, available investigations on the problems associated with fabrication of these composite materials.",

This study finds composites to have significant economic potential when considering emerging advances in the polymer composite body-in-white design against the mild-grade steel body currently on the road. With the significant implications of a polymer composite body for vehicle light-weighting and thereby improved fuel efficiency, these results come at a time when they are particularly pertinent. The results presented in this paper are based on a consortium-developed, 25-part unibody design not available to previous studies. Also presented for the first time are data on competing alternatives in fiber composite component assembly and implications of platform sharing across vehicle models. Finally, developments in process-based cost modeling capabilities are presented for (a) fiber-reinforced composite component production, (b) component assembly, and (c) design implications of glass versus carbon reinforcement. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Diagrams are presented to show the history of relevant kinematical, dynamic and energetic quantities, both to synthesize the dependency of the energy parameters and force threshold values on the impact velocity.

The corrugated struc- ture was stitched to 3D woven S2-glass fiber face sheets and infiltrated with a rubber toughened, impact resistant epoxy. The quasi-static compressive stress–strain response of the panels was experimentally investigated as a function of the strut width to length ratio and compared to micromechanical predic- tions. Slender struts failed by elastic (Euler) buckling which transitioned to plastic microbuckling as the strut aspect ratio increased. Good agreement was observed between experimental results and micro- mechanical predictions over the wide range of core densities investigated in the study.",

Recent advances in health monitoring technologies have resulted in the development of micro-dimensional devices that can be embedded into composite laminates. Notwithstanding their small size, such inclusions may affect the response of the composite. Damage induced by the peak values of stress concentration around the embedded inclusion is, in fact, one of the main concerns in smart structures technology. To address this specific issue, unidirectional S2 glass fiber/epoxy laminated composites are fabricated with embedded small implants that mimic potential sensors and microprocessors. Quasi-static tensile tests are then performed on those samples while monitoring them by the acoustic emission (AE) technique. Additionally, the microstructure of the material with and without implants is explored. The AE results show that early low-medium amplitude events are detected at the implant location and the micrographic inspections reveal that micro-cracks initiate at the device-composite matrix interface and grow around the implant causing the debond of the external component from the surrounding resin system. © The Author(s), 2009.",

Filament wound tubular composite specimens were immersed in distilled water at two different temperatures for approximately four months and their moisture absorption was recorded. The rate of moisture absorption was greater for the group of specimens immersed in distilled water at an elevated temperature (50 ??C) than those at room temperature (???20 ??C). Multi-axial tests were performed subsequently, and it was observed that for all biaxial stress ratios, strength and stiffness decreased to some extent with the presence of moisture and increasing temperature. Strains parallel and transverse to the fibers at functional failure (leakage) showed little variation in the presence of moisture and temperature with the exception of pure hoop loading. Microscopically, the greatest water damage was apparent in the matrix and at the fiber-matrix interface where there was less resin adhesion to the fibers with increasing water temperature. Fiber strength was also negatively affected, possibly due to either leaching out of the glass fibers interface layer or glass fiber embrittlement, and less effective bonding and load distribution at the fiber-matrix interface. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials and methods: Experimental composite resin was prepared by mixing short fibers (3 mm in length) with a fraction of 22.5 wt% and IPN-resin 22.5 wt% with silane treated silica filler 55 wt% using high speed mixing machine. Test specimens (2 mm ?? 2 mm ?? 25 mm) and (9.5 mm ?? 5.5 mm ?? 3 mm) were made from the experimental composite (FC) and conventional particulate composite resin (control, Z250, 3M-ESPE). The test specimens (n = 6) were either dry stored or water stored (37 ??C for 30 days) before the mechanical tests. Three-point bending test was carried out according to ISO 10477 and compression loading test was carried out using a steel ball (??3.0 mm) with speed of 1.0 mm/min until fracture. Degree of monomer conversion (DC %) of both composites was determined by FTIR spectrometry. Water sorption and solubility of specimens were also measured. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the microstructure of the composite. Results: ANOVA revealed that experimental fiber composite had statistically significantly higher mechanical performance of flexural strength (210 MPa) and compressive load-bearing capacity (1881 N) (p &lt; 0.05) than control composite (111 MPa, 1031 N). Degree of conversion of the FC (59%) and conventional composite (57%) was at the same range. Significance: The use of short fiber fillers with IPN-polymer matrix yielded improved mechanical performance compared to conventional restorative composite. ?? 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.",

Descriptions of the chemical and mechanical nature of the siloxane interphases that bond the polymer matrix to the reinforcing phase and their effects on the mechanical properties of fiber reinforced composites are described. While protection of the reinforcement from environmental damage and improvement of adhesion between phases have been well documented, neither the characterization of the properties of the interphase nor its consequences on the durability of a composite material have been definitively resolved. It is generally agreed, however, that synthetically created interphases are often mechanical weak links and a potential source for the initiation of defects in a structure. Recent research has focused on the attainment of monomolecular, reactive surface layers that form strong chemical bonds with both constituents. In this case, the polymeric ‘interphases’ are reduced in dimension to as close to a true ‘interface’ as molecular dimensions allow. Recent work in this area and speculation on the properties required are presented.",

          "abstract": "This chapter begins with a historical overview of carbon fiber-reinforced (CFR) ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) composites used in orthopedics (Poly II). One carbon-UHMWPE composite, commonly known as Poly II (Zimmer, Inc., Warsaw, Indiana, USA), was developed commercially and used clinically. The CFR-UHMWPE was reinforced by chopped, randomly oriented carbon fibers in a direct compression molded UHMWPE matrix. The chapter reviews recent advances in UHMWPE matrix and fiber composites for biomedical applications. However, many of the composite and fiber applications are sufficiently novel and proprietary that product information could only be obtained from commercial suppliers or by interviewing historical witnesses. It is necessary to interpret the nominal values provided by suppliers as such and independently verify key properties that are judged to be essential for biomedical implant performance. UHMWPE composite materials and fibers are widely used in military, industrial, and consumer applications. UHMWPE composite films blended with glass fibers are used as insulative barriers in lead automotive batteries, whereas porous UHMWPE materials find applications as water filters. UHMWPE fibers are used in military and personal protection equipment, such as body armor and cut-resistant gloves for kitchen use. Overall, the current commercial success for a wide range of UHMWPE fiber and matrix composites with nonmedical applications provides motivation for exploring these materials as candidate biomaterials. ?? 2009 Copyright ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The stages of the surface reaction layer formation were similar to those of 45S5 bioactive glass although the kinetics of the reaction layer formation were slower. We combined the bioactive glass fibers with a polymeric matrix to form a fiber-reinforced composite material and observed the formation of a calcium phosphate layer on the surface of the glass fibers within the composite material after immersion in both protein-free and protein-containing simulated body fluids.

This study newly proposes a developed methodology to manufacture a glass-fiber/epoxy resin composite blade of a small 1 kW wind generator system. The improved mechanical properties of the composite blade are verified in a series of systematic experiments. The study focuses on the responses of applying a torsional loading to a long straight member such as the root of the composite blade. The core aluminum shaft was wrapped in glass-fiber/epoxy to form the root of the composite blade and a composite shaft. The composite shaft is a sandwich structure combining glass-fiber/epoxy and an aluminum shaft. The composite shaft was placed in a torsional testing machine and a strain gage monitored the strain on the composite shaft. We considered the composite blade to have a circular cross section and determined both stress distribution within the member and the angle of twist. Finally, mechanical properties were obtained in torsional testing, including the relationship between applied torque and the angle of twist on the composite shaft. The torsional loading and failure locations of the blade root were measured experimentally. The experiments showed that the weakest location of the blade root is at the interface of the aluminum shaft and glass-fiber/epoxy lay-ups in the composite blade root. It is found that the quality of the aluminum shaft, the glass-fiber/epoxy layers around the shaft and the bonding at the interface between the shaft and the layers should be increased to improve the torsional strength of the composite blade. These results can provide a reference for analysts and designers of small wind turbine systems.",

Variables under investigation include the fiber weight percent added to the matrix as well as fiber length. Dental specimens with glass fiber content of 2, 5.1, 5.7, and 7.6 wt% with fiber length of either 1.5 or 3 mm, were prepared by mixing an activated dental resin with commercial glass fibers. The specimens were then tested on a pin on disc setup, where the antagonist disc was manufactured of a similar fiber-reinforced composite with 5.1 wt% fiber and fiber length of 3 mm. The volume loss and coefficient of friction of the specimens was monitored periodically throughout testing. In addition, the wear surfaces of all specimens were evaluated using a scanning electron microscope. The specimens with 5.7 wt% fibers and fiber length of 3 mm performed better in this study compared to all other fiber-reinforced specimens under all load conditions. In fact, this specimen had a comparable wear rate to a particle-filled dental composite. For the fiber lengths considered, increasing the length of the fibers increased the wear resistance of the specimen. The coefficient of friction showed a good correlation with the wear resistance of specimens. Fiber-reinforced composites demonstrated a high resistance to wear and may therefore be advantageous for dental applications, where high wear resistance is essential to functionality. ?? 2005 Academy of Dental Materials.

Tensile strength and elastic modulus of BFRP and BGRP samples have shown moderate reduction after aging at 25°C after 6 months, however, they were reduced considerably after aging at 75°C for 3 months.

BFRP and BGRP samples were also loaded cyclically at maximum cyclic load of 35, 50, 65, and 80% of their ultimate tensile stress. Results suggest that BGRP has better fatigue resistance than BFRP at all load levels tested. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

There is a lack of data regarding the clinical usefulness of such prostheses. PURPOSE: The clinical performance of 31 resin-bonded, glass fiber-reinforced composite fixed partial dentures was evaluated in a preliminary study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prostheses were made to replace 1 to 3 missing maxillary or mandibular teeth in each of 31 patients. The prostheses had a framework made of continuous unidirectional E-glass fibers with multiphase polymer matrix and light-polymerized particulate composite resin veneering. The prostheses were examined after 6-month periods for up to 24 months (mean follow-up time was 14 months). Partial or total debonding of the prostheses or the framework fracture was considered a treatment failure. RESULTS: Two prostheses debonded during the follow-up period; 1 debonding was related to improper occlusal adjustment and the other to unknown reasons. Kaplan-Meier survival probability at 24 months was 93%. No framework fractures were observed. CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary study suggest that the resin-bonded, glass fiber-reinforced FPDs may be an alternative for resin-bonded FPDs with a cast metal framework.",

Past studies show that only artificial fibers such as glass, carbon etc., have been used in fiber-reinforced plastics. Although glass and other synthetic fiber-reinforced plastics possess high specific strength, their fields of application are very limited because of their inherent higher cost of production. In this connection, an investigation has been carried out to make use of coir, a natural fiber abundantly available in India. Natural fibers are not only strong and lightweight but also relatively very cheap. In the present work, coir composites are developed and their mechanical properties are evaluated. Scanning electron micrographs obtained from fractured surfaces were used for a qualitative evaluation of the interfacial properties of coir/epoxy and compared with glass fiber/epoxy. These results indicate that coir can be used as a potential reinforcing material for making low load bearing thermoplastic composites. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

While no significant change in fatigue life was observed for both types of samples tested in air and in water when cyclically tested at 85% of average ultimate tensile strength (UTS), the detrimental effect of water becomes apparent at lower stress levels of 65 and 45% UTS. Compared to samples tested in air, cyclic loading in water results in shorter fatigue lives for both glass and hybrid samples. While all of the glass fiber composite samples did not survive to 106 cycles when loaded in water, hybrid samples showed better retention in structural integrity under environmental fatigue for lives up to 107 cycles, a consequence of the corrosion resistant of carbon fiber. Thus, by incorporating appropriate amount of carbon fibers in glass fiber composite, a much better performance in fatigue can be achieved for glass-carbon hybrid composite. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Two different architectures of the composite-laminate armor are considered: (a) a hybrid armor consisting of a 100 μm-thick high MWCNT-content PVEE-matrix MWCNT-reinforced lamina sandwiched between two PVEE-matrix/E-glass mat reinforced laminas and (b) a monolithic E-glass mat reinforced composite laminate with a low MWCNT-content MWCNT-doped PVEE-matrix. The projectile/armor interaction simulation results show that both armor architectures yield a minimal (∼6%) increase in the ballistic-protection as measured by the armor V50, a velocity at which the probability of armor penetration by a given fragment is 50%. The results obtained are rationalized using a simple analysis of the effect of MWCNTs on the in-plane and the through-the-thickness properties of the armor. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of fiber length distribution in the composite and fracture surface was performed to study fiber breakage fracture mechanism. The simultaneous compounding of polypropylene with two fillers was done to obtain a hybrid composite. The mechanical properties of hybrid, injection molded, chopped glass fiber/wollastonite/polypropylene composites have been investigated taking into account the effect of hybridization by these two types of fillers. This system is expected to have considerable mechanical properties, good surface finish and low cost. It has been found that the tensile, flexural, and impact properties of the filled polypropylene were higher than those of unfilled polypropylene.

The development of high-performance engineering products made from natural resources is increasing worldwide day by day. There is increasing interest in materials demonstrating efficient use of renewable resources. Nowadays, more than ever, companies are faced with opportunities and choices in material innovations. Due to the challenges of petroleum-based products and the need to find renewable solutions, more and more companies are looking at natural fiber composite materials. The primary driving forces for new bio-composite materials are the cost of natural fibers (currently priced at one-third of the cost of glass fiber or less), weight reduction (these fibers are half the weight of glass fiber), recycling (natural fiber composites are easier to recycle) and the desire for green products. This Review provides an overview of natural fiber reinfocred composites focusing on natural fiber types and sources, processing methods, modification of fibers, matrices (petrochemical and renewable), and their mechanical performance. It also focuses on future research, recent developments and applications and concludes with key issues that need to be resolved. This article critically summarizes the essential findings of the mostly readily utilized reinforced natural fibers in polymeric composite materials and their performance from 2000 to 2013. Recent economic and ecological issues have encouraged the development of new materials with less environmental impact, produced from renewable resources with a high level of biodegradability. Therefore, all over the world, there is rising acceptance in materials demonstrating efficient use of renewable resources. Natural fiber reinforced bio-based polymers can replace synthetic composites with cost equivalence and better properties.

The mechanical characterization of these composites is performed. The three body abrasive wear behavior of fabricated composites has been assessed under different operating conditions. Abrasive wear characteristics of these composites are successfully analysed using Taguchi&#039;s experimental design scheme and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results obtained from these experiments are also validated against existing microscopic models of Ratner-Lancaster and Wang. It is observed that quite good linear relationships is held between specific wear rate and reciprocal of ultimate strength and strain at tensile fracture of these composites which is an indicative that the experimental results are in fair agreement with these existing models. Out of all composites fabricated it is found that tensile strength of bi-directional E-glass fiber reinforced composites increases because of interface strength enhancement. Chopped glass fiber reinforced composites are observed to perform better than bi-directional glass fiber reinforced composites under abrasive wear situations. The morphology of worn composite specimens has been examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to understand about dominant wear mechanisms. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Machining processes are generally used to cut; drill, or contour composite laminates for building products. In fact, drilling is one of the most commonly used manufacturing processes to install fasteners for assembly of laminate composites. The material anisotropy resulting from fiber reinforcement heavily influences the machinability during machining. Machining of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) components is often needed in spite of the fact that most FRP structures can be made to near-net shape and drilling is the most frequently employed secondary machining process for fiber reinforced materials. Therefore, the precise machining needs to perform to ensure dimensional stability and to obtain a better productivity of the component. The drilling parameters and specimen parameters evaluated were speed, feed rate, drill size and specimen thickness. A series of experiments were conducted using TRIAC VMC CNC machining center to machine the composite laminate specimens at various cutting parameters and material parameters. The measured results of delamination at the entry and exit side of the specimen were measured and analyzed using commercial statistical software MINITAB14. The experimental results indicated that the specimen thickness, feed rate and cutting speed are reckoned to be the most significant factors contributing to the delamination. A signal-to-noise ratio is employed to analyze the influence of various parameters on peel up and push down delamination factor in drilling of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) composite laminates. The main objective of this study is to determine factors and combination of factors that influence the delamination using Taguchi and response surface methodology and to achieve the optimization machining conditions that would result in minimum delamination. From the analysis it is evident that among the all significant parameters, specimen thickness and cutting speed have significant influence on peel up delamination and the specimen thickness and feed have more significant influence on push down delamination. Confirmation experiments were conducted to verify the predicted optimal parameters with the experimental results, good agreement between the predicted and experimental results obtained to be of the order of 99%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The initial fiber lengths and glass fiber contents varied from 3, 6, and 12 mm, and 10, 20, and 30 phr, respectively, and the mechanical and morphological properties of the wood/PVC composites are then monitored. The results suggest that the tensile and flexural moduli and strengths of the wood/PVC composites increase with increasing glass fiber contents. The tensile and flexural moduli and strengths of the WPVC composites at 10--20 phr glass fiber loadings are more dependent on carbonyl (C=O) content on the fiber surface, but those at 30 phr glass fiber loadings are influenced by the average final length of glass fibers. The impact strength of the wood/PVC composites progressively increase with increasing glass fiber content. The elongation at break is found to slightly decrease with increasing glass fiber content due to increases in fiber-end effects and stress concentrations in the wood/PVC composites. The effect of initial fiber length on the degree of composite shrinkage is very small, the values ranging from 0.3 to 1.3%.",

The reversible Diels-Alder reaction between a furan-functionalized epoxy-amine thermosetting matrix with a maleimide-functionalized glass fiber was used to impart remendability at the polymer-glass interface for potential application in glass fiber-reinforced composites. At room temperature the Diels-Alder adduct is formed spontaneously and above 90 ??C the adduct breaks apart to reform the original furan and maleimide moieties. Healing of the interface was investigated with single fiber microdroplet pull-out testing. Following complete failure of this interface, significant healing was observed, with some specimens recovering over 100% of the initial properties. Healing efficiency was not affected by the distance of displacement, with an overall average of 41% healing efficiency. Up to five healing cycles were successfully achieved. It is expected that a glass fiber-reinforced composite of maleimide-sized glass within a furan-functionalized network will demonstrate extension of fatigue life. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Analyses based on US Department of Energy H2A cost and efficiency parameters and economic methodology indicate the potential for hydrogen delivery costs below $1/kg H2.

There are several tests to determine the interfacial strength between a fiber and resin, but all of them present difficulties in interpreting the results and/or sample preparation. In this study, we observed the influence of different aminosilanes fiber coatings on the resistance of epoxy-based composite materials using a very easy fractographic test. In addition, we tried a new fluorescence method to get information on a molecular level precisely at the interface. Strength was taken into account from two standpoints: (i) mechanical strength and (ii) the resistance to hydrolysis of the interface in oriented glass-reinforced epoxy-based composites. Three silanes: gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, gamma-Aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane, and gamma-Aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane were used to obtain different molecular structures at the interface. It was concluded that: (i) the more accessible amine groups are, the higher the interface rigidity is; (ii) an interpenetrating network mechanism seems to be the most important for adhesion and therefore to the interfacial strength; and (iii) the higher the degree of crosslinking in the silane coupling layer is, the higher the hydrolytic damage rate is.",

The reinforcement is a glass fibers fabric and the matrix is an acrylic polymer. Until very recently, this thermoplastic polymer family was not used in composite industry. It is therefore necessary to study if the existing fiber surface treatments are suitable for acrylic resins or if new ones have to be found. At the macroscale, composite materials corresponding to different fiber surface treatments were characterized with: (i) monotonic in-plane shear tests and (ii) heat-build up fatigue measurements on specimens with ±45° fiber orientations with respect to the tensile force. At the mesoscale (fabric scale), the development of damage was experimentally analyzed from (i) 3-D DIC (Digital Image Correlation) full-field strain measurements with spatial resolution smaller than the textile repeating unit and (ii) X-ray microtomography. We show that the analyzed composite materials exhibit linear viscoelastic behavior until a given stress threshold above which damage develops in the material. It was also found that the application on the fibers of a coupling agent specifically developed for promoting the bond between glass fibers and acrylic resins improves the composite mechanical properties, in particular the fatigue properties.",

Methods. Test specimens made of two indirect particulate composites (BelleGlass HP, Kerr, Orange, CA) or (Targis, Ivoclar Vivadent, Amherst, NY) were reinforced with ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber ribbon (Connect, Kerr, Orange, CA), woven E-glass fibers (Vectris Frame, Ivoclar Vivadent, Amherst, NY) or unidirectional R-glass fibers (Vectris Pontic, Ivoclar Vivadent, Amherst, NY). Fibers were placed with different positions, orientations or geometry into the rhombic test specimens (2??2??25 mm3). Control specimens did not contain fiber reinforcement. The test specimens (n=6) were stored in distilled water for 1 week at 37 ??C before testing in a three-point loading test to determine the initial and final fracture load values. Results. Initial failure loads varied from 22.6 to 172.1 N. The lowest value resulted from one UHMWPE reinforcement fiber located in diagonal orientation and the highest from two unidirectional glass fiber reinforcements, one located on the tension side and the second on the compression side. Significance. Position and fiber orientation influenced the load to initial and final failure, and specimen deflection. Tension side reinforcement was most effective in increasing the load to initial and final fracture. ?? 2004 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Glass fiber-reinforced composite materials are attractive because their properties can be tailored to meet the specific needs of a variety of applications. The mechanical and thermal properties of a composite generally follow the rule of mixtures. As glass fiber is the major component at 70-75% by weight (50-60% by volume), selection of the correct glass product is critical. Glass fiber reinforcement is available in many forms, including continuous rovings, chopped fibers, fabrics, and nonwoven mats. In addition to form, selection of a reinforcement product involves choosing a glass type, chemistry on the glass (sizing) filament diameter, and tex. Glass formulation or type governs mechanical, thermal, and corrosion properties, whereas sizing protects the glass during handling and gives compatibility with the resin system. Filament diameter and strand tex are chosen to balance physical properties and manufacturing efficiency. A significant amount of tensile strength, up to 50%, may be lost from a pristine single filament to a multi-filament roving. To minimize this degradation, the utmost care and consistency must be exercised in the fiber forming process. This, coupled with selection of a high-performance glass formulation, enables use of composites in highly demanding applications, such as pressure vessels and ballistic armor. © 2012 The American Ceramic Society and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

The fundamental importance of a special class of secondary relaxations called the Johari-Goldstein ??-relaxations becomes clear from the recent advances.

          "abstract": "Statement of problem. Different fiber types are available for reinforcing composite restorations. Little information exists regarding optimal fiber type/bonding agent combinations. Purpose. This in vitro study examined the influence of storage time and 2 fiber wetting agents on the flexural properties of an indirect dental composite reinforced by 3 fiber types. Material and methods. Three types of fiber (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, Kevlar, and Glass fiber) were used to reinforce samples of an indirect composite (Artglass) prepared to test flexural properties. Each fiber type was used to prepare 3 groups of 10 specimens after fiber wetting with an unfilled or a filled resin bonding agent. All fibers were weighed to an accuracy of 0.01 mg to standardize the amount of fiber placed in the base (tensile side) of the specimen preparation mold (2 X 2 X 25 mm). Fiber-reinforced samples wetted with the unfilled resin were stored for 24 hours before flexural testing, whereas separate groups of fiber-reinforced samples wetted with the filled resin were tested after both 24 hours and 6 months storage in water at 37??C. Two additional groups of unreinforced composite control specimens (10 samples per group) were prepared, one for each of the 2 storage times, resulting in 11 groups total. Mean flexural strengths (MPa) and flexural modulus (GPa) values were determined in a 3-point bend test at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min by use of a universal testing machine. Comparisons between means were performed with 2- and 1-way analysis of variance tests (??=.01) to demonstrate the influence of storage time, fiber wetting agent, and fiber type on the flexural properties of the indirect dental composite tested. Results. Significant increases (124% to 490%) in mean flexural strength (P&lt;.01) were found for all fiber-reinforced groups in comparison to the unreinforced controls at both storage time intervals. The silane containing unfilled bonding agent gave the greatest reinforcing effect (364%) when used with the glass fiber material. After 6 months storage in water, a significant decline (28%) occurred in the mean flexural strength of the glass fiber-reinforced specimens (P&lt;.01) when the filled bonding agent was used. Conclusion. Within the limitations of this study, the choice of fiber type and wetting agent was shown to have a significant positive influence on the flexural properties of the fiber-reinforced composite. When used with the silane containing unfilled bonding agent, the glass fiber increased the mean flexural strength of the unreinforced indirect composite by 364%.

Hemp fibers are found in the stem of the plant which makes them strong and stiff, a primary requirement for the reinforcement of composite materials. Themechanical properties of hemp fibers are comparable to those of glass fibers. However their biggest disadvantage is the variability in their properties.

Teeth were loaded and resistance of specimens was measured as the axial compressive load to cause fracture and macroscopic fracture patterns were observed. One way ANOVA revealed a significant difference in fracture resistance (p &lt; 0.001). Tukey post hoc test also revealed significant differences between groups as samples restored with fiber posts exhibited mostly restorable fractures.

          "abstract": "The vast reduction in the size and power consumption of sensors and CMOS circuitry has led to a focused research effort on the on-board power sources which can replace the batteries. The concern with batteries has been that they must always be charged before use. Similarly, the sensors and data acquisition components in distributed networks require centralized energy sources for their operation. In some applications such as sensors for structural health monitoring in remote locations, geographically inaccessible temperature or humidity sensors, the battery charging or replacement operations can be tedious and expensive. Logically, the emphasis in such cases has been on developing the on-site generators that can transform any available form of energy at the location into electrical energy. Piezoelectric energy harvesting has emerged as one of the prime methods for transforming mechanical energy into electric energy. This review article provides a comprehensive coverage of the recent developments in the area of piezoelectric energy harvesting using low profile transducers and provides the results for various energy harvesting prototype devices. A brief discussion is also presented on the selection of the piezoelectric materials for on and off resonance applications. Analytical models reported in literature to describe the efficiency and power magnitude of the energy harvesting process are analyzed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",

Purpose The survival rates of 29 resin-bonded, glass fiber-reinforced composite fixed partial dentures were evaluated in this clinical study for periods of up to 42 months. Material and methods FPDs were fabricated to replace 1 to 3 missing maxillary or mandibular teeth of 29 patients not able to be treated with conventional FPDs. Originally, there were 37 patients (the drop-out rate was 22%). The FPDs were retained with wings, inlays, complete coverage crowns, or combinations of these that were bonded to tooth structure. The FPD frameworks were made of continuous unidirectional E-glass fibers with a multiphase polymer matrix and light-polymerized particulate composite veneer. The patients were recalled for examinations, where a general dental examination was performed, 1 to 3 times per year for up to 63 months (minimum 24 months, mean 42 months). Partial or complete total debonding of the FPD or the framework fracture was considered a treatment failure. The data were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier survival test (??=.05). Results Two resin frameworks fractured, and 3 frameworks were debonded. Kaplan-Meier survival probability at 63 months was 75%. Three of the failed FPDs were rebonded or repaired in situ, producing a functional survival rate of 93% after rebonding or repairing (mean survival time was 55 months). Conclusion The results of this clinical study of 29 prostheses suggest that glass fiber-reinforced FPDs may be a possible alternative to cast metal resin-bonded FPDs. These restorations were successfully used as multiple-unit prostheses that employed a variety of abutment tooth preparation designs.",

Materials and methods: Experimental composite FC resin was prepared by mixing 22.5 wt.% of short E-glass fibers, 22.5 wt.% of IPN-resin and 55 wt.% of silane treated silica fillers using a high speed mixing machine. As control material, commercial particulate filler composite resin (PFC) was used. Polymerization shrinkage-strain and stress of the specimens (n = 5) were measured using the bonded-disc technique and tensilometer, respectively with respect to time. FC composite and PFC were placed incrementally in class II cavities sized 4 mm × 4 mm × 6 mm (n = 8/group) using total-etch adhesive system according to manufacturer&#039;s instructions. After the class II restorations were completed, the specimens were finished and polished, thermocycled, stained, sectioned, and viewed under a stereo-microscope for leakage at occlusal/enamel and gingival/dentin margins. The data were analyzed using ANOVA. Results: ANOVA revealed that restorations made from experimental FC composite had a significantly lower shrinkage stress and microleakage than those made from PFC (p &lt; 0.05). The data show that gingival margins had higher microleakage than that obtained from occlusal margins of restorations (p &lt; 0.05).

Recently, it was suggested that an interfacial energy parameter might constitute a valid alternative. From an overview of the literature regarding the single-fiber composite fragmentation test, it appears that energy-based approaches have already been proposed in the past, but were either not successful, or not fully developed. Our recent energy balance scheme, proposed for the analysis of the initial interface debonding which occurs at fiber breaks during a fragmentation test, is presented and expanded here. The effects of thermal residual stress in the fiber, and of friction in the debonded area, are now incorporated in the energy balance model. We use a different shear-lag parameter proposed by Nayfeh, rather than the commonly used Cox parameter. New, extensive single-fiber fragmentation data regarding the interface crack initiation regime is presented, using sized and unsized E-glass fibers embedded in UV-curable or epoxy polymers. Some data for unsized carbon in epoxy is also presented. Fiber fragmentation is forced to take place entirely in the linear elastic region of the stress-strain curve, by means of pre-stressed single, fibers. The importance of this procedure, is discussed. Future work will focus on the interface crack propagation regime.",

For this reason, damage of such structures subjected to impact is a crucial case study in current research. The typical types of damages are mainly caused during production, repair, maintenance, or by particle crashes during function, and collisions between different structures. In this paper, four different fiber reinforced composite plates are studied after being impacted by a standard drop weight with different impact energies and moments. The damage zones are studied by ultra-sonic non-destructive inspection. Carbon fiber reinforced composite plates show the best structural behavior under low velocity impacts meanwhile carbon/glass fiber reinforced (hybrid) plates show suitable behavior under high impact energy. Finally, all the plates are modeled using ANSYS LS DYNA V6.1 under similar conditions to those of the tests. The damage zone shapes derived from software modeling do not show very good coincidence with those resulting from the tests. However, the software is able to predict the threshold of damage as it is verified well by test results. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A Nicalon-fiber-reinforced hybrid composite with a matrix of barium magnesium aluminosilicate (BMAS) glass with silicon carbide whiskers was subjected to thermal shock from elevated to ambient temperatures. The combination of SiC whisker and BMAS glass resulted in a hybrid matrix with a lower thermal expansion than that of the fibers, inducing tensile stresses in the fiber upon thermal shock. This stress state resulted in microstructural damage in the form of fiber cracking and cracking along the fiber/ matrix interface, as opposed to the conventional matrix cracking which is typically observed in ceramic-matrix composites. Significant damage in the composite was only observed after three thermal shock cycles. Flexural resonance measurements, used to evaluate thermal shock-induced changes in Young&#039;s modulus, showed a reduction in modulus that correlated well with the onset of microstructural damage. Finally, fiber push-out tests, performed to evaluate changes in fiber/matrix interface strength after thermal cycling, indicated a slight decrease in interfacial strength, which was attributed to recession of the carbon-rich fiber surface during thermal shock. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Five groups of crowns were fabricated (n = 6). The crowns were either polymerized with a hand-light curing unit (LCU) or cured in a vacuum curing device (VLC) before they were statically loaded at a speed of 1 mm min-1 until fracture. Failure modes were visually examined. Data were analyzed using ANOVA. ANOVA revealed that crowns made from the FC had a statistically significant higher load-bearing capacity than the control PFC composite. Crowns with FRC substructure and PFC covering gave force values of 348 N (LCU) and 1199 N (VLC), respectively, which were lower than the values of FC composite. No statistically significant difference was found between crowns made from plain FC composite and those made from FC composite with a surface layer of PFC (P = 0.892 and 1.00).

This work evaluated the use of Curauá fibers in polyamide-6 composites aiming at glass fiber replacement. Fiber content of 20, 30 or 40 wt% and fiber lengths of 0.1 or 10 mm were studied. Fibers were treated with N2 plasma or washed with NaOH solution, to improve their adhesion to PA-6. Samples with 20 wt% of short or long fibers, with or without pre-treatment, were compounded in two different co-rotating intermeshing twin-screw extruders. These samples were submitted to mechanical and thermal tests. In conclusion, non-dried raw materials improved fiber/matrix interfacial adhesion. Tensile and flexural properties of this composite are better than unfilled, but lower than glass fiber reinforced polyamide-6. However, its impact resistance and heat deflection temperature are similar to the glass fiber reinforced polyamide-6 and its lower density, enable it to replace this latter in specific non-critical applications. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though articles related to natural fiber composites are abundant in the literature, work on natural fiber textile composites is found to be rare. Composites with high tensile strength can be obtained using banana and glass in the fabric form, using two layers of the fabric. The impact strength of the composites increases with the number of layers and the fiber volume fraction. By incorporating the fabric, the G&#039; curve shows an improved rubbery plateau indicating that the incorporation of the fabric induces reinforcing effects in the polyester matrix. The storage modulus has been found to be the highest for composites with four layers of the fabric. In all the composite samples, the relaxation peak of polyester is visible as peak in G&#039;&#039; at about 98 degrees C. In the case of composites with four layers of the fabric, two peaks and one shoulder are seen. Increase in the number of layers made a second relaxation peak visible. The damping peaks have been found to be lowered by the incorporation of more number of layers.",

Recent advances of health monitoring technologies have resulted in development of micro-dimensional sensors that can be embedded into composite laminates. Notwithstanding their small sizes, such inclusions may affect the response of the composite. Damage induced by the peak values of stress concentration around the embedded devices is, in fact, one of the main concerns. To assess this and related issues, we have fabricated a series of samples with and without embedded (dummy) sensors and micro-processors in S2 glass fiber/epoxy laminates, and systematically tested the samples while continuously monitoring the response by the acoustic emission technique. In this manner we have sought to address the process of damage initiation and evolution within the material. The results show that acoustic events begin earlier on during the loading process, in specimens with embedded sensors and the source of the damage is located near the sensors. These early events are associated with matrix failure at the sensor-resin interfaces through micrographic observations.",

Novel fiber-reinforced composite materials are purported to have increased fatigue resistance compared with metals and may offer a solution to the problem of metal fatigue. Purpose. The aim of this study was to investigate the fatigue resistance and stiffness of E-glass fiber-reinforced composite. Material and methods. Twelve cylindrical fiber-reinforced composite test cylinders (2 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length) were made from light-polymerized urethane dimethacrylate monomer with unidirectional, single-stranded, polymer preimpregnated E-glass fiber reinforcement. Six cylinders were stored in dry conditions and 6 in distilled water for 30 days before testing. Fatigue resistance was measured by a constant-deflection fatigue test with 1 mm of deflection across a specimen span of 11 mm for a maximum of 150,000 loading cycles. The resistance of the cylinder against deflection was measured (N) and the mean values of the force were compared by 1-way analysis of variance (??=.05). The flexural modulus (GPa) was calculated for the dry and water-stored cylinders for the first loading cycle. Scanning electron microscopy was used to assess the distribution of the fibers, and the volume percent of fibers and polymer were assessed by combustion analysis. Results. The test cylinders did not fracture due to fatigue following 150,000 loading cycles. Flexural modulus at the first loading cycle was 18.9 (?? 2.9) GPa and 17.5 (?? 1.7) GPa for the dry and water-stored cylinders, respectively. The mean force required to cause the first 1-mm deflection was 33.5 (?? 5.2) N and 37.7 (?? 3.6) N for the dry and water stored cylinders, respectively; however, the differences were not significant. After 150,000 cycles the mean force to cause 1-mm deflection was significantly reduced to 23.4 (?? 8.5) N and 13.1 (?? 3.5) N, respectively (P&lt;.0001). Scanning electron microscopy highlighted fiber- and polymer-rich areas within the specimens and indicated that individual fibers were well impregnated with resin. The combustion analysis studies identified the fiber content to be 35.9 vol%. Conclusion. The results of this study suggest that the fatigue resistance of the fiber-reinforced material examined was increased; however, the reduction in flexural modulus of fiber-reinforced composites may restrict their use where high rigidity is required, such as in removable partial denture clasps.",

          "abstract": "Statement of problem: Several post surface treatments with or without the application of a bonding agent have been recommended to improve the bond strength of resin cements to posts. A regimen that produces the maximum bond strength of glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts has not been verified. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of post surface conditioning methods and artificial aging on the retention and microleakage of adhesively luted glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts. Material and methods: Seventy-two endodontically treated single-rooted teeth were prepared for glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts. The posts were submitted to 3 different surface treatments (n=24), including no treatment, etching with phosphoric acid, and airborne-particle abrasion. Subgroups of the posts (n=8) were then allocated for 3 different experimental conditions: no artificial aging, no bonding agent; no artificial aging, bonding agent; or artificial aging, bonding agent. The posts were luted with resin cement (Calibra). Post retention was measured in tension at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min. The posts assigned for microleakage investigation were placed in fuchsin dye for 72 hours. The dislodged posts and the post spaces were examined microscopically to evaluate the mode of failure and explore the microleakage. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD test (??=.05). Results: The mean (SD) retention values for test groups ranged from 269 (63.8) to 349 (52.2) N. The retention values of the airborne-particle-abrasion group were significantly higher than those of the acidic-treatment and no-treatment groups. The application of bonding agent on the post surface produced no significant influence on retention. The mean retention values after artificial aging were significantly higher than without artificial aging. Microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the failure mode was primarily mixed. Conclusions: Treating the surface of the posts with phosphoric acid for 15 seconds before cementation produced no significant improvement in post retention. Airborne-particle abrasion of the surface of the post significantly improved post retention. ?? 2010 The Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

          "abstract": "Natural/bio-fibers are replacing synthetic reinforcements traditionally used for the preparation of the environmentally friendly composites. Composite materials are also replacing conventional materials in various fields due to their ease of processability. Chopped glass fiber- and recycled newspaper cellulose fiber (RNCF)- reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites were processed using a full size twin-screw extruder and an injection molder. Additionally, a glass-reinforced polypropylene (PP) composite was compounded and molded, and compared to PLA/RNCF and PLA/glass fiber composites. The tensile and flexural moduli of RNCF- reinforced composites were significantly higher when compared to the virgin resin. The morphology, evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, indicated uniform dispersion of both fibers in the PLA matrix. The mechanical and thermo-physical properties of PLA/RNCF, PLA/glass and PP/glass fiber composite were studied and compared using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). DMA results confirmed that the storage and loss moduli of the PLA/RNCF composites increased with respect to the pure polymer, whereas the mechanical loss factor (tan delta) decreased. The results of the TGA experiments indicated that the addition of fibers increased the thermal stability of the biocomposites compared to neat PLA. The heat defection temperature of PLA/RNCF was found to be comparable to that of the glass fiber-reinforced PLA composites. Such studies are of great interest in the development of environmentally friendly composites from biodegradable polymers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "In the recent past, the research involving the fabrication and processing of reinforced polymer nanocomposites has increased significantly. These new materials are enabling in the discovery, development and incorporation of improved nanocomposite materials with effective manufacturing methodologies for several defense and industrial applications. These materials eventually will allow the full utilization of nanocomposites in not only reinforcing applications but also in multifunctional applications where sensing and the unique optical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties of nanoparticles can be combined with mechanical reinforcement to offer the greatest opportunities for significant advances in material design and function. This paper presents two methods and material systems for processing and integration of the nanomaterial constituents, namely: (a) dispersing alumina nanoparticles using high energy mixing (using ultrasonication, high shear mixing and pulverization) and (b) electrospinning technique to manufacture nanofibers. These reinforced polymer nanocomposites and the processing methodologies are likely to provide effective means of improving the interlaminar properties of woven fiber glass composites compared to the traditional methods such as stitching and Z-pinning. The electrospinning technology relies on the creation of nanofibers with improved molecular orientation with reduced concentration of fiber imperfections and crystal defects. Electrospinning process utilizes surface tension effects created by electrostatic forces acting on liquid droplets, creating numerous nanofibers. These nanofibers thus have potential to serve as through-the-thickness reinforcing agents in woven composites. While the electrospun nanofibers provide bridging through-the-thickness reinforcement, the use of the nanoparticles influences the thermo-physical properties and provides an effective means from commercially available nanolevel material configurations to form reinforced polymer nanocomposites. Studies indicate that their mechanical behavior and performance however depends on incorporation, and functionalization of these alumina nanoparticles. Both these methods and material systems provide effective means for integrating the nanomaterial constituents into traditional fiber composite systems. In particular, this paper discusses the experimental study of the processing and delamination (interlaminar failure) characteristics (via Mode I fracture toughness assessment) of reinforced composite systems. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

If the fiber length retained in the finish product is too short, it will limit the expected improvement in the property. Extrusion and pultrusion are two methods normally employed for the melt compounding of polymer composite feedstock for the injection molding and produced short- and long-fiber composites (SFCs and LFCs), respectively. In this work, short- and long-glass fiber-reinforced polyamide 6,6 composites were injection molded at different fiber loading and tested for the tensile properties, impact properties and fiber length characteristics. It was found that both tensile strength and tensile modulus of LFCs improved compared to the SFCs counterpart despite reduction in fracture strain, while pultrusion compounded composites also showed superior fiber characteristics, in terms of fiber length distribution, Ln, Lw, etc. compared to the extrusion compounded composites counterpart. Fiber length characteristics were also in agreement with the improvement in tensile strength and tensile modulus of LFCs over the SFCs. Impact properties of LFCs also show some improvement compared to the SFCs counterpart with equivalent composition, despite longer fiber retained in composites.",

Empty composite and empty hybrid tubes crushed predominantly in progressive crushing mode, without applying any triggering mechanism. Foam filling was found to be ineffective in increasing the crushing loads of the composite tubes over the sum of the crushing loads of empty composite tube and foam. However, foam filling stabilized the composite progressive crushing mode. In empty hybrid tubes, the deformation mode of the inner Al tube was found to be a more complex form of the diamond mode of deformation of empty Al tube, leading to higher crushing load values than the sum of the crushing load values of empty composite tube and empty metal tube. The foam filling of hybrid tubes however resulted in axial splitting of the outer composite tube due to the resistance imposed by the foam filler to Al tube inward folding and hence it was ineffective in increasing crushing load and SAE values over those of empty hybrid tubes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study focused on the performance of injection-molded short hemp fiber and hemp/glass fiber hybrid polypropylene composites. Results showed that hybridization with glass fiber enhanced the performance properties. A value of 101 MPa for flexural strength and 5.5 GPa for the flexural modulus is achieved from a hybrid composite containing 25 wt % of hemp and 15 wt % of glass. Notched Izod impact strength of the hybrid composites exhibited great enhancement (34%), Analysis of fiber length distribution in the composite and fracture surface was performed to study the fiber breakage and fracture mechanism. Thermal properties and resistance to water absorption properties of the hemp fiber composites were improved by hybridization with glass fibers.

Little information exists regarding how the manipulation of the cross-sectional design of a prosthesis might affect the modulus of elasticity and toughness. Purpose. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of simple and complex cross-sectional designs on the modulus of elasticity and toughness of fiber-reinforced composite used for dental prostheses. Material and methods. Two particulate composites (BelleGlass HP and Targis) were reinforced with ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fiber ribbon (Connect), woven E-glass fibers (Vectris Frame), or unidirectional R-glass fibers (Vectris Pontic). A range of fiber positions, orientations, or geometries were incorporated into the rhombic specimens (2 ?? 2 ?? 25 mm3) to achieve simple and complex experimental cross-sectional designs. The control specimen did not contain fiber reinforcement. Specimens (n = 6) were stored 1 week in distilled water at 37??C prior to 3-point load testing to determine the modulus of elasticity (GPa) and toughness (MPa). The data within each main fiber group were subjected to 1-way analysis of variance and a Tukey post hoc test (??=.05). Cross-sections of randomly selected test specimens (n = 2) were made for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the fiber distribution. Results. The mean modulus of elasticity varied from 8.7 ?? 2.0 GPa (Targis control) to 21.6 ?? 1.4 GPa (2 unidirectional glass fiber reinforcements, 1 each at the tension side and the compression side). Mean toughness varied from 0.07 ?? 0.02 MPa (unidirectional glass fiber positioned at the compression side) as the lowest mean, to 4.53 ?? 0.89 MPa (unidirectional glass fiber positioned at the tension side) as the highest. Significant differences were identified between specimen groups in each main category (all groups P&lt;.001, except modulus of elasticity of the woven E-glass groups, where P=.003). SEM micrographs showed fiber distribution in the cross section of test specimens to correspond with the intended fiber geometry. Conclusion. The modulus of elasticity of the composite specimens increased when 1 or more glass fiber groups were located at the compression side of the specimen. Toughness was most effectively increased when 1 or more fiber groups were located at the tension side of the specimen.

Fifty extracted intact mandibular premolars were divided into 5 groups (n = 10): ST, sound teeth (control); MOD, mesio-occlusal-distal preparation + endodontic treatment (ET) + composite resin restoration (CR); MODP, mesio-occlusal-distal + ET + glass fiber post + CR; MOD2/3, mesio-occlusal-distal + two thirds occlusal-cervical cusp loss + ET + CR; and MODP2/3, mesio-occlusal-distal + two thirds cusp loss + ET + glass fiber post + CR. The specimens were loaded on a cusp slope until fracture. Fracture patterns were classified according to four failure types. Stress distributions were evaluated for each group in a two-dimensional finite element analysis. The fracture resistance of the MODP, MOD2/3, and MODP2/3 groups was significantly lower than the ST and MOD groups (p &lt; 0.05). The loss of dental structure and the presence of fiber post restoration reduced fracture resistance and created higher stress concentrations in the tooth-restoration complex. However, when there was a large loss of dental structure (MODP2/3), the post reduced the incidence of catastrophic fracture types. ?? 2008 American Association of Endodontists.",

In this paper, we document our attempt to balance the structural and impact performance of glass-reinforced composites produced using a fiber-sizing package composed of mixed silane coupling agents to vary the reactivity of the fiber with the matrix phase. Additionally, enhancement of post-failure energy absorption through increased frictional dissipation during fiber-matrix pull-out was explored through control of the surface roughness of the glass fibers. A unique inorganic-organic hybrid fiber sizing formulation was successfully applied at a commercial E-glass manufacturing facility to produce rovings as well as woven fabric reinforcements.

In this work, damage tolerance of polypropylene (PP)/E-glass LFTs subjected to transverse blunt object impact (BOI) was investigated, treated from an experimental standpoint, in order to characterize energy dissipation and damage modes. LFT subjected to BOI exhibited high impact energy dissipation, which increased linearly with increasing areal density. The average impact energy dissipation at the critical velocity (ballistic limit) was 167 J and 121 J for a 4.61 g cm-2 specimen impacted by flat and conically shaped projectiles, respectively. The fiber orientation also played a large role in energy dissipation; failure appeared to occur along planes of preferential fiber orientation. The critical energy for specimen perforation did not vary with the mass of the impactor, i.e. strain rate, in the range investigated.

This failure process requires better characterization.\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 2 chemical solvents, hydrogen peroxide and methylene chloride, on the shear bond strength of quartz and glass fiber posts to a composite resin.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four posts (3 +/-0.1 mm in length) were prepared for each quartz (LIGHT-POST (LP)) and glass fiber (Cytec blanco (CB)) post. Posts were horizontally embedded in acrylic resin with half of the post diameter exposed. The exposed surfaces were successively ground with 400-, 800-, and 1200-grit silicon carbide papers, to ensure uniform smoothness. The specimens were divided into 3 subgroups (n=8) representing different surface treatment techniques, including application of silane for 60 seconds (S), etching with hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes (H), and etching with methylene chloride for 5 seconds (M). Silane-treated specimens served as controls. A dual-polymerized composite resin (Tetric EvoCeram) was placed in a polytetrafluoroethylene mold (30 x 2 mm) positioned upon the post specimens and polymerized for 20 seconds with a light-emitting diode (LED) polymerization unit. The specimens were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Shear bond strength values (MPa) of posts and composite resin cores were measured using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post hoc Tukey intervals for comparison among the 2 post materials and 3 surface treatment techniques were calculated (alpha =.05). The effect of the chemical surface treatments on glass and quartz fiber post surfaces were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).\n\nRESULTS: There were significant differences between the shear bond strength for LP and CB (P&lt;.001). For all groups, the application of H showed the highest bond strength values. There was no significant difference between the S and M groups (P&gt;.05). The SEM observations demonstrated that the fiber post surfaces were modified after chemical surface treatment techniques.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The surface treatment of quartz and glass fiber posts with hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced the shear bond strength of the composite resin tested due to its ability to dissolve the epoxy resin matrix used in each post. The lowest bond strength was obtained with M and S groups. Application of methylene chloride to the fiber post surfaces for 5 seconds was not effective in increasing the shear bond strength of the fiber post to composite resin.",

The same trend was observed with the impact value of the samples. All the tests were conducted for the composite with and without liquid epoxidized natural rubber addition.

The optimum fiber content for the best wear resistance of the PA12 composite was approximately 30. wt.% and higher fiber contents had no added effect on the wear amount.

          "abstract": "Statement of problem: Despite recent advances in adhesive dentistry, fiber-reinforced post/resin cement/dentin adhesive combinations are not able to prevent microleakage. While studies have examined microleakage in endodontically treated teeth restored with posts and cores, microleakage among post and adhesive systems remains a concern. Purpose: This study compared the sealing properties of 4 adhesively luted post systems: glass fiber, quartz-glass fiber, zirconia-glass fiber and polyethylene fiber posts. Material and methods: Forty-eight permanent maxillary central incisors were divided into 4 groups (n=12). Post space was prepared and each post was adhesively luted with 1 of 3 systems: a 1-stage self-etch, a 2-stage total-etch, and a 3-stage total-etch adhesive. The specimens were separately immersed in freshly prepared 2 methylene blue solution for 1 week. The cleaned specimens were then embedded in autopolymerizing acrylic resin. The teeth were horizontally sectioned into apical, middle, and coronal portions. An occlusal view of each section was digitally photographed with a stereomicroscope. The methylene blue-infiltrated surface for each specimen was measured and data were collected with software. Dye penetration was estimated as the ratio of the methylene blue-infiltrated surface to the total dentin surface. Nonparametric data were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test (α=.05). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compute multiple pairwise comparisons that identified differences among groups. Dentin-luting agent and post interfaces were evaluated with a scanning electron microscope. Results: Significant differences in adhesive and post systems were observed in all sectioned regions (P&lt;.05). There were significant differences between the apical and coronal sections of each post type, and between the following pairs: middle versus coronal sections of zirconia-glass fiber and glass fiber posts and apical versus middle sections of quartz-glass fiber and polyethylene fiber posts (P&lt;.05). No significant differences were found among post types. The variables of middle section and 3-stage adhesive produced significant differences in microleakage between the following post pairs: zirconia-glass fiber versus quartz-glass fiber, zirconia-glass fiber versus polyethylene fiber, and quartz-glass fiber versus polyethylene fiber (P&lt;.05). Conclusions: The 3-stage adhesive and zirconia-glass fiber posts demonstrated the least microleakage.

          "abstract": "With growing environmental awareness, ecological concerns and new legislations, bio-fiber-reinforced plastic composites have received increasing attention during the recent decades. The composites have many advantages over traditional glass fiber or inorganic mineral-filled materials, including lower cost, lighter weight, environmental friendliness, and recyclability. In the present work a banana fiber and silica powder reinforced composite material is developed. Scanning electron microscopy shows that banana fibers are well dispersed in the resin matrix. Addition of fiber increases the modulus of elasticity and decreases the ultimate tensile strength of the epoxy. And further addition of silica also increases the modulus of elasticity reduces the ultimate tensile strength. Addition of banana highly reduces yield strength and addition of silica gives better results than banana reinforced composites but still having yield strength highly reduced. Banana reinforced improve the impact strength of epoxy materials. Addition of fibers increases the capacity of water absorption. This test is necessary where the composites are used in moisture affected areas. Addition of banana fiber reduces bending strength and addition of silica with banana has not given better bending strength than banana fiber reinforced composites.",

Specimens were exposed to hot water at temperatures of 50, 70, and 90 C for 1 and 2 weeks periods prior to the joint assembly and testing. Having conducted tensile tests, it was finally concluded that failure behavior of joints in aged specimens is strictly related to the temperature applied and holding time in hot water. Both extending of immersion time and increasing liquid temperature were found to affect the mechanical characteristics of joint, adversely. In addition, glass fiber reinforced composite plates were realized to have increased in weight due to the moisture absorption, the amount of which is dependent on immersing time and temperature. Another finding derived from experiments is that, the joints with fasteners preloaded under 6 Nm tightening torque offer noticeable advantage in terms of stiffness and strength compared with the finger-tightened ones, just as experienced in unaged specimens. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Glass fiber posts were luted to post spaces using different cements. Experimental specimens were stored in water, while control specimens were desiccated and stored in mineral oil to eliminate water from intraradicular dentinal tubules and/or the external environment that could have contributed to hygroscopic expansion of the cements. Thin slice push-out tests revealed no difference in retention strengths of resin composite cements that were stored in water or oil. Conversely, GIC and RMGIC cements exhibited increased retention strengths after water sorption. As unfavorable cavity geometry is taxing to dentin bond integrity in root canals, a strategy that relies on increasing the frictional resistance to post dislodgement via delayed hygroscopic expansion of glass-ionomer based materials may be a more pragmatic approach to fiber post retention. ?? 2006 American Association of Endodontists.",

The short beam strength increased up to %Vf of 30 vol.%, evidencing a maximum in terms of overall fiber/matrix interface and composite quality.

In this work, a new slab system composed of a fiber-reinforced concrete top laid on glass fiber reinforced polymeric (GFRP) wide-flange-section pultruded profiles, filled in with foam blocks, is presented. The material properties of the GFRP profiles were obtained both theoretically and experimentally. Experimental tests to choose the appropriate resin to bond the concrete to the GFRP profiles and to select the appropriate short fiber and volume fraction to be used in the concrete top have also been conducted. The slab was designed to sustain constructive loads and live pedestrian loads for footbridge deck applications. To investigate the slab flexural behavior up to failure, three specimens were tested under four-point bending, and theoretical and finite element analyses were also performed. Comparisons of theoretical, numerical and experimental results show good agreement.

The resulting waviness has a detrimental effect on mechanical properties, therefore this condition is important to detect and characterize. Ultrasonic characterization methods are difficult to interpret because elastic wave propagation is highly dependent on ply orientation and material stresses. By comparison, the pulsed terahertz response of the composite is shown to provide clear indications of the fiber waviness. Pulsed Terahertz NDE is an electromagnetic inspection method that operates in the frequency range between 300 GHz and 3 THz. Its propagation is influenced by refractive index variations and interfaces. This work applies pulsed Terahertz NDE to the inspection of a thick composite beam with fiber waviness. The sample is a laminated glass composite material approximately 15mm thick with a 90-degree bend. Terahertz response from the planar section, away from the bend, is indicative of a homogeneous material with no major reflections from internal plies, while the multiple reflections at the bend area correspond to the fiber waviness. Results of these measurements are presented for the planar and bend areas.",

The most significant advantage of HPFRCC over conventional concrete is their high tensile ductility. However, the tensile strain capacity has been observed to vary, most likely as a result of the variability of the microstructure derived from the processing of these materials. This paper describes the composite property variability, as well as the variability of the material microstructure. Scale linkage is discussed. In particular, the tensile stress-strain curves, and the crack pattern on uniaxially loaded specimens are presented. The treatment of random fibers in micromechanical models, and tailoring of matrix flaw size distribution for saturated multiple cracking are examined. It is suggested that robust composite properties can be achieved by deliberate control of microstructure variability. Some open issues concerning the randomness of microstructures and possibly related macroscopic behavior are also identified. Further gains in composite property control may be expected from improvements in characterization and modeling of the microstructure randomness. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this paper bulletproof laminates were obtained using 30 plies of glass-fiber reinforced-epoxy matrix composites. The ballistic performance of these laminates was varied by modifying the properties of the constituent laminate or by changing the laminate assemblage. An automated digital analysis procedure was developed in order to determine size and shape parameters that characterize the damaged areas. The procedure developed proved to be robust and sensible enough to cope with subtle variations on the damaged areas, which are due to the differences on the mechanical response of the composites caused by modifications on their microstructure. The results obtained show that not only the area of delamination is important to quantify the ballistic performance. The isotropy of the ballistic response, determined measuring the Feret Ratio or the Circular Shape Factor, is also important. ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Addressed in this paper are critical material property issues related to the short fiber reinforced composite used in rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RP and M). Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer has been a popular choice of material used in fused deposition modeling (FDM), a commonly used RP and M process. However, conventional ABS polymers in the filamentary form for FDM are known to be of low strength and hardness. In order to overcome this deficiency, ABS was modified by incorporating several different property modifiers including the short glass fiber, plasticizer, and compatibilizer. Glass fibers were found to significantly improve the strength of an ABS filament at the expense of reduced flexibility and handleability. The latter two properties of glass fiber reinforced ABS filaments were improved by adding a small amount of plasticizer and compatibilizer. The resulting composite filament, prepared by extrusion, was found to work well with a FDM machine. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

In this work, glass and ramie fibers cut to 45 mm in length were used to produce hybrid polymer composites by resin transfer molding (RTM), aiming to evaluate their physical, mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties as a function of the relative glass–ramie volume fractions and the overall fiber content (10, 21 and 31 vol.%). Higher fiber content and higher ramie fiber fraction in the hybrid composites yielded lower weight composites, but higher water absorption in the composite. The mechanical properties (impact and interlaminar shear strength) of the composites were improved by using higher fiber content, and the composite with 31 vol.% of reinforcement yielded the lowest value for the reinforcement effectiveness coefficient C, as expected. Although the mechanical properties were improved for higher fiber content, the glass transition temperature did not vary significantly. Additionally, as found by analyzing the adhesion factor A, improved adhesion tended to occur for the composites with lower fiber content (10%) and higher ramie fiber fraction (0:100) and the results for the adhesion factor A did not correspond to those found by the analysis of the tan delta peak height.",

A total of 70 FPDs were fabricated of the composites Sinfony, Vita Zeta and Targis. With each material, 10 FPDs were made without glass fiber-reinforcement and 10 were reinforced with the new glass fiber system EverStick. In addition, 10 FPDs were fabricated of the material combination Targis/Vectris. After thermocycling, all FPDs were loaded until failure in a universal testing machine. The FPDs were then cut and cross-sectional areas were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The load to fracture of the fiber-reinforced FPDs lay between 615 and 1191 N, which was significantly greater than the values found with unreinforced FPDs (between 178 and 307 N). The highest values were found with the combinations Targis/Vectris (1191 N) and Sinfony/EverStick (1137 N). SEM showed that the FPDs with EverStick reinforcement not only exhibited fracture lines in the fiber-composite interface, but also more often in the area of the fiber-reinforcement than was the case with the FPDs with Vectris reinforcement. The load to fracture was not significantly dependent on fiber quantity or course of fracture. It may be concluded that the fracture resistance of four-unit composite FPDs can be significantly raised by glass fiber frameworks (p&lt;0.05).

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The possibility of polymerizing glass fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) material into the root canal was preliminarily evaluated by determining the depth of light-initiated polymerization of FRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material used was polymer-preimpregnated E-glass fiber reinforcement, which was further impregnated with light-polymerizable dimethacrylate monomer resin. The same resin without fiber reinforcement was used as a control. Six different lengths (range 4 to 24 mm) of light-protected cylinders filled with the test materials were light polymerized from one end. The degree of monomer conversion was determined from the other end by FT-IR spectrometry. Infrared spectra were recorded at six time points from the beginning of polymerization. The microhardness of the test materials was measured from the light-exposure surface toward the other end of the cylinder. RESULTS: Both groups showed a reduction in the degree of conversion with increased lengths of the cylinder. The FRC group showed a higher degree of conversion in the longest sample group compared to the resin group. Microhardness measurement confirmed the constant reduction of the degree of conversion by the reduced Vickers hardness values with increased cylinder length of the FRC. CONCLUSION: Generally, the glass FRC showed an almost equal degree of conversion after light curing as monomer resin without fibers. However, in the longest cylinders, FRC showed a slightly higher degree of conversion compared to resin only; this might be due to the fibers&#039; ability to conduct light.",

          "abstract": "Piezoelectric fiber composite sensors (PFCSs) made from micro-sized lead zirconate titanate (PZT) fibers have many advantages over the traditional bulk PZT sensors for embedded sensor applications. PFCSs as embedded sensors will be an ideal choice to continuously monitor the stress/strain levels and health conditions of composite structures. PFCSs are highly flexible, easily embeddable, have high compatibility with composite structures, and also provides manufacturing flexibility. This research is focused on examining the effects of embedding PFCS sensors (macro-fiber composite (MFC) and piezoelectric fiber composite (PFC)) on the structural integrity of glass-fiber-epoxy composite laminates. The strengths of composite materials with embedded PFCSs and conventional PZT sensors were compared, and the advantages of PFCS sensors over PZTs were demonstrated. Initially a numerical simulation study is performed to understand the local stress/strain field near the embedded sensor region inside a composite specimen. High stress concentration regions were observed near the embedded sensor corner edge. Using PFCS leads to a reduction of 56% in longitudinal stress concentration and 38% in transverse stress concentration, when compared to using the conventional PZTs as embedded sensors. In-plane tensile, in-plane tension-tension fatigue, and short beam strength tests are performed to evaluate the strengths/behavior of the composite specimens containing embedded PFCS. From the tensile test it is observed that embedding PFCS and PZT sensors in the composite structures leads to a reduction in ultimate strength by 3 and 6% respectively. From the fatigue test results it is concluded that both embedded PFCS and PZT sensors do not have a significant effect on the fatigue behavior of the composite specimens. From the short beam strength test it is found that embedding PFCS and PZT sensors leads to a reduction in shear strength by 7 and 15% respectively. Overall the pure PZT sensors seem to have low compatibility with composites when compared to PFCSs.",

(2) Determination of color differences between non-fiber-reinforced composites and fiber-reinforced composites. (3) Investigation of relationship between light transmittance and color. Methods: A commercial microhybrid composite was reinforced with S-type braided glass fibers. The samples were divided into three groups-one was used as the control group, with no reinforcements; the second group was reinforced with a single layer of glass fibers; the third was reinforced with double layers of fibers. Transmittance was measured from 400 nm to 700 nm for all samples. Color values were also measured for all samples and color differences were determined amongst the three groups, based on the CIE L* a* b* color system. The differences in transmittance, color values and color differences were determined by applying one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) along with Tukey&#039;s HSD. Correlation coefficients were calculated between transmittance at different wavelengths and color values. Results: There were significant differences in transmittance between the control group and the experimental groups. Color changes were also significant amongst the three groups. The control group appeared lighter than both the experimental groups. Addition of fibers shifted the color of the composite samples towards the +a* (red) and +b* (yellow) regions i.e. towards the longer wavelength regions. Statistically significant correlations were found between wavelength of transmitted beam and color values, especially at longer wavelengths. Significance: Within the scope of this study, it was found that inclusion of glass fibers reduced the amount of light transmitted through the composite structure. Color was also altered with an increase in chroma component and reduction in lightness. ?? 2007 Academy of Dental Materials.",

          "abstract": "The flexural properties of glass-fiber epoxy unidirectional composites have been studied as the surface of the glass fiber is changed. The glass fibers were treated with two different coatings: a mono-epoxy and a di-epoxy. Both were deposited on the fibers by a solvent process at several coating concentrations in order to produce different interfacial properties and thicknesses of the coating. Flexural tests performed along the fiber axis with different span-to-depth ratios confirm that the critical ratio depends on the fiber surface modification. In the case of composites with mono-epoxy coated fibers, the tensile/compressive and shear stresses decrease as the coating thickness increases. However, for the composites with di-epoxy coated glass fibers, the tensile/compressive and shear stresses exhibit a maximum as the thickness increases. Evidence of the fiber surface modification is provided by analysis of the fracture surfaces of all of the composites. Dynamic mechanical analysis shows that the unidirectional composites with di-epoxy-coated fibers and with a thickness-to-fiber radius ratio of 1.2% appear to have stronger interfacial bonds. Different damping behaviour is observed for the coating thickness as for the type of coatings. The width of the ??-transition also shows a variation with fiber coating thickness indicating some changes in the matrix stoichiometric ratio or in the network structure.",

          "abstract": "The tensile properties of E-glass, which is the most popular reinforcement fiber in composite materials, were determined from the experimental results of fiber bundle testing under a high strain rate. The tests were performed by using two types of experimental methods. One is the tension-type split Hopkinson bar system and the other is the universal highspeed tensile-testing machine. In the results, it was demonstrated that the tensile strength and fracture strain of E-glass fiber increased with the strain rate. The absorbed strain energy, therefore, significantly increased. It was also shown that the strain rate dependency of E-glass fiber tensile strength was strongly affected by fiber diameter. The smaller diameter of E-glass fiber has the stronger strain rate dependency. Finally, the impact tensile strengths of high-strength glass and carbon fibers were investigated. It was confirmed that the tensile strength of the high-strength glass fiber also increased with the strain rate, but the tensile properties of carbon fiber were almost independent of the strain rate. © 2012 Japan Society for Composite Materials, Korean Society for Composite Materials and Taylor &amp; Francis.",

          "abstract": "Polymer and glass-fiber reinforced polymer composites are extensively employed in the aerospace and automotive industries. As a result, the demand for accurate machining of these materials has increased in recent years. Especially, the trend of miniaturization of the components or parts makes the micro-machining such as micro-milling very important in the machining area. In current study, an attempt has been made to better understand the micro-machinability of polyamide 6 and glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6 manufactured by injection molding. To achieve this aim, tool wear, cutting force, surface roughness and burr formation during micro-milling of these materials were evaluated and results were compared. The experiments were conducted at various spindle speeds and feed rates and the influences of these parameters on output responses were investigated. It was concluded that forces increased with feed rate and spindle speed, but surface roughness decreased with spindle speed for both workpiece materials. Adhesion on micro tool was observed for unreinforced polyamide 6, however adhesion, abrasive wear, rounding of cutting edges and micro chipping were seen for glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6. Protrusion of fibers, fiber failure/fracture and fiber/matrix debonding were observed on the workpiece surface when micro-milling was conducted at glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6. It was found that the top burr size of down micro-milling was higher than that of up micro-milling for both materials. The main burr shape was wall type for unreinforced polyamide 6 and wavy burr for glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6. From micro-machinability point of view, unreinforced polyamide 6 gave better results as compared to glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6.",

          "abstract": "Publisher Summary This chapter describes a novel process to manufacture aligned discontinuous fiber composites using electric fields. It is demonstrated that the orientation of dielectric fibers like glass fibers (with and without polymer powder coating) can be effectively controlled using electric fields. Aligned discontinuous fiber composite (ADF) processes composites made of glass fibers and nylon-12 matrix provides significant improvements in stiffness and strength with fiber alignment. The effect of the microstructure on the performance of ADF composites has been established. Recent advances in the area of powder coating of fibers at MSU in combination with the phenomenon of aligning fibers in electric fields, has paved the way to conceptualize and develop the novel high-speed processing methodology that can manufacture aligned discontinuous fiber composites. Full realization of the stiffness to weight benefits of these composites is possible due to effective fiber alignment combined with the ability to pack and process at higher volume fraction of fibers. Absence of solvents or liquids in the ADF process improves the speed of processing many folds and makes the process environmental friendly. The fiber alignment technique of the ADF process is simple in operation and design, with the scope for retrofitting this technique in an existing composite sheet or lamination processing unit. Aligned discontinuous fiber composites are flexible and can be molded or stamped into complex parts. It is envisaged that ADF composites, with unique performance and processability capabilities, can expand the range of the applicability of discontinuous fiber thermoplastic composite materials to many areas in the automotive, infrastructure, and durable goods sectors.",

Application of polyurea to composites, as a shock mitigation material is a relatively new idea. In this study, layered and sandwich composite materials, comprising of polyurea (PU) and E-glass vinyl ester (EVE) composite are experimentally evaluated for effective blast resistance using a shock tube. Rectangular plates of the plain-woven composite and the layered composite, simply supported along two edges and free along the other two were subjected to controlled blast. The free end of the plate was observed real time using a high-speed camera during the dynamic bending due to the blast. Results indicate that addition of the polyurea layer on the impact face considerably increases the blast resistance. Further, sandwich materials prepared by sandwiching the polyurea between two composite skins had the best blast resistance compared to the layered and the composite plates. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

As results of the combinations from the samples, nine different structures has been obtained. Furthermore, a new mold have been designed for the RTM method. To provide a full infiltration (wetting) of fibers, a simple method has been applied in this new mold system. A new computer aided and multiple-specimen test apparatus have been designed and constructed to simulate load and stress behavior of axial fan blades on the wind tribunes. This multiple specimen apparatus has a big advantage to shorten test time and to test 16 specimens at the same time. Firstly, composite specimens have been applied to the three-point bending test. Later, fatigue tests have been carried out. For the bending fatigue test, &quot;fixed stress&quot; fatigue type has been used. To determine the fatigue limit of all the specimens, S-N diagrams (W??hler plots) have been derived from experimental results. According to the test results, the highest fatigue life has been obtained from 800 g/m2 fiber glass woven specimens with 0/90?? (group E). The property of anisotropy of the GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic) material is dominant on the fatigue strength which has been clearly observed from the experiments.

The preferential orientation of the MWNTs in the thickness direction was found to contribute to the increase in the interlaminar shear properties. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of wood content, volume fraction of continuous glass fiber and the presence of coupling agent on the mechanical properties of the final products. Three point bending, tensile and impact tests were carried out on the extruded specimens. The results revealed an outstanding improvement in all the mechanical properties, where applying a low fraction of continuous reinforcement via incorporating six rovings of (continuous) fiber reinforcements into the WPCs, maximum increase in flexural, tensile and impact strength were observed to be 2.3, 5.9 and 20 times, respectively. Achieving these large increases in properties via conventional variations in processing and material parameters has not been reported. It is interesting to note that, when applying a larger number of reinforcements, presence of coupling agent in WPCs, exhibited a negative effect on the tensile properties. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

As expected, processing technique and processing parameters are important in determining the mechanical properties of the molded regrind. Our results show that injection- and extrusion-compression-molded regrind composites have good fiber bundle dispersion and fiber alignment, resulting in tensile properties better than the compression-molded samples.

          "abstract": "Unidirectional glass fiber reinforced and glass-carbon fiber reinforced epoxy matrix composite specimens were subjected to tension-tension fatigue in air and in distilled water at 25 °C. While no significant change in fatigue life was observed for both types of specimens tested in air and in water when cyclically tested at 85% of average ultimate tensile strength (UTS), the detrimental effect of water becomes apparent at lower stress levels of 65 and 45% UTS. Compared to specimens tested in air, cyclic loading in water results in shorter fatigue lives for both glass and hybrid specimens. While all of the glass fiber specimens did not survive to 106 cycles when cyclically loaded in water, hybrid specimens (with 25% carbon fiber (by volume), 75% glass fiber (by volume), 30% total fiber volume fraction) showed better retention in structural integrity under environmental fatigue, for fatigue lives up to 107 cycles, a consequence of the corrosion resistant of carbon fiber. Thus it is shown, by incorporating appropriate amount of carbon fibers in glass fiber composite, a much better performance in fatigue can be achieved for glass-carbon hybrid composite. A simple life prediction model for the hybrid composite is proposed. Model predictions are compared with experiments results from both laminated interply and intermingled intraply hybrid composites. Results suggest that synergistic effect of the reinforcing fibers is critical in governing the fatigue behavior of intraply hybrid composite. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The main advantage of having a material that degrades is so that an implant would not necessitate a second surgical event for removal. In addition, the biodegradation may offer other advantages. In this study, fibers produced from a quaternary phosphate-based glass (PBG) in the system 50P(2)O(5)-40CaO-5Na(2)O-5Fe(2)O(3) (nontreated and heat-treated) were used to reinforce the biodegradable polymer, PLA. Fiber properties were investigated, along with the mechanical and degradation properties and cytocompatibility of the composites produced. Retention of mechanical properties overtime was also evaluated. The mean fiber strength for the phosphate glass fibers was 456 MPa with a modulus value of 51.5 GPa. Weibull analysis revealed a shape and scale parameter value of 3.37 and 508, respectively. The flexural strength of the composites matched that for cortical bone; however, the modulus values were lower than those required for cortical bone. After 6 weeks of degradation in deionized water, 50% of the strength values obtained was maintained. The composite degradation properties revealed a 14% mass loss for the nontreated and a 10% mass loss for the heat-treated fiber composites. It was also seen that by heat-treating the fibers, chemical and physical degradation occurred much slower. The pH profiles also revealed that nontreated fibers degraded quicker, thus correlating well with the degradation profiles. The in vitro cell culture experiments revealed both PLA (alone) and the heat-treated fiber composites maintained higher cell viability as compared to the nontreated fiber composites. This was attributed to the slower degradation release profiles of the heat-treated composites as compared to the nontreated fiber composites. SEM analyses revealed a porous structure after degradation, and it is clear that there are possibilities here to tailor the distribution of porosity within polymer matrices.",

The tensile properties of the plain aluminum, the composite materials and the thermoplastic fiber-metal laminates were investigated at quasi-static rates of loading. The fatigue tests were also conducted under load control in accordance with the ASTM E466 standard procedure. Various loading cycles were employed for the fatigue tests in order to minimize the possibility of heat generation on the composite materials. Load levels of 40, 60 and 80% of yield strength of each thermoplastic fiber-metal laminate panel were applied with zero to max loading.

Sorption behavior and effects of environmental aging on tensile properties of both BFRP and BGRP systems were studied by immersing samples in water for up to 1200 h at 25°C. Compared to BFRP, a 4% drop in saturated moisture level is seen in BGRP. After aging in water for 1200 h, reduction in tensile strength and modulus for BGRP is nearly two times less than that of BFRP. Use of MAPP as coupling agent in the polypropylene matrix results in decreased saturated moisture absorption level and enhanced mechanical properties for both BFRP and BGRP systems.

The full-field displacement and strain localization are effectively captured at meso-scale. At continuum scale, a remarkable change in mechanical response is observed when the loading axis diverges from principal axes. The variation in the global mechanical response is observed to be most prominent in the change of stiffness and strain at failure. At meso scale, a high degree of local deformation heterogeneity is observed and the level of inhomogeneity is found to be more prominent in case of the 45?? off-axis specimens. While fiber-pull out is the major failure mode in the case of specimen loaded parallel to 0?? and 90?? fiber orientation, the localized shear strain developed in polymer-rich regions is the driving failure cause in the case of 45?? off-axis specimen.",

To fulfill this objective, the following steps have to be followed: (i) To figure out a method for achieving uniform Ni catalyst coating on the glass fiber. (ii) To obtain a uniform carbon nanomaterial coating on glass fiber. Vertically aligned carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were obtained at 500. °C, where as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were obtained over the glass fiber at 600 and 700. °C. Structure, morphology and properties of these carbon nanomaterials are discussed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), I- V analysis, etc. (iii) In the last step, carbon nanomaterials coated glass fiber reinforced epoxy composites were prepared by hand lay-up method. The results showed that the Young&#039;s modulus of composites was greatly improved by the addition of carbon nanomaterials coated glass fiber. The dynamic mechanical analysis observations indicated that the incorporation of carbon nanomaterials coated glass fiber restricted the movement of molecular chain of the epoxy resin and also set up bridging between the glass fiber and polymer matrix.

          "abstract": "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The flexure of the fiber- reinforced composites (FRC) which can be generally used instead of fixed metal- framework prostheses have been more advocated due to the enormous demands for the conservative and esthetic restoration. The flexure of the fiber should be well-fitted to its covering composite. No study has been reported the comparison of the combination of glass and polyethylene fiber with particulate filled composite and fiber reinforced composite yet.\n\nPURPOSE: This study compared the flexural strength of two types of fibers combined with three types of composites.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHOD: Sixty-six specimens were prepared in a split mold (25×2×2 mm). The specimens were divided into six groups according to the type of resin and the fiber (N = 11): group 1: Z250 composite + Polyethylene fiber; group 2: Build It composite + Polyethylene fiber; group 3: Nulite F composite+ Polyethylene fiber; group 4: glass fiber + Z250 composite; group 5: glass fiber + Build-It composite and group 6: glass fiber + Nulite F. The mean ﬂexural strengths (MPa) values were determined in a 3-point bending test at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min by a universal testing machine (Zwick/Roell Z020, Germany). The results were statistically analyzed, using one and two- way ANOVA and LSD post-hoc tests (p&lt; 0.05).\n\nRESULTS: The highest flexural strength was registered for glass fiber in combination with Z250 composite (500 MPa) and the lowest for polyethylene fiber in combination with Build-It composite (188 MPa). One-way ANOVA test revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between polyethylene fiber combinations (p= 0.62) but there was a significant difference between glass fiber combinations (p= 0.0001). Two-way ANOVA revealed that the fiber type had a significant effect on flexural strength (p= 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION: The choice of ﬁber and composite type was shown to have a signiﬁcant positive influence on the ﬂexural properties of the ﬁber-reinforced composite. Glass fiber has a significant influence on the flexural properties of directly- made specimens.",

Biodegradable polymers are often combined with osteoconductive materials, such as bioactive glass (BaG), which can also improve the mechanical properties of the composite. The aim of this work was to develop and characterize BaG fiber reinforced starch-poly-epsilon-caprolactone (SPCL) composite. Sheets of SPCL (30/70 wt %) were produced using single-screw extrusion. They were then cut and compression-molded in layers with BaG fibers to form composite structures with different combinations. Mechanical and degradation properties of the composites were studied. The actual amount of BaG in the composites was determined using combustion tests. Initial mechanical properties of the reinforced composites were at least 50% better than the properties of the nonreinforced specimens. However, the mechanical properties of the composites after 2 weeks of hydrolysis were comparable to those of the nonreinforced samples. During the 6 weeks hydrolysis the mass of the composites had decreased only by about 5%. The amount of glass in the composites remained as initial for the 6-week period of hydrolysis. In conclusion, it is possible to enhance initial mechanical properties of SPCL by reinforcing it with BaG fibers. However, mechanical properties of the composites are typical for bone fillers and strength properties need to be further improved for allowing more demanding bone applications.",

In particular, this review focuses on determining the impact of fiber concentration, aspect ratio, orientation distribution, interaction with the suspending medium, and suspending medium viscoelasticity on the rheology of glass fiber composite fluids. The presence of glass fiber can induce a yieldlike behavior, causing shear thinning to occur at reduced shear rates. Glass fiber can impede the elastic properties of the suspending medium but enhance the first normal stress function. Large stress overshoots in both the shear and normal stress growth functions are observed that are associated with changes in fiber orientation. Upon cessation of flow, stress relaxation follows that of the suspending medium but fibers retain their orientation. The presence of glass fiber can induce extension rate thinning and suppress the strain thickening behavior of the suspending medium.",

Pre-sterilized filters were incubated in solid or liquid media at 30????C for 21 days. Biodegradability was monitored by evaluating microbial colonization, increase in biomass and weight loss of filters coupons. Among the species under investigation, the two strains of T. harzianum (MYA198 and BCC5828) showed the best biodegradability performance and were used to analyse total carbon and esterase activity. Our results clearly indicate that cells grown in the presence of shredded filters display a hydrolytic activity and lead to a consistent removal of the organic portion of the tested filters.

The chemical, mechanical, and physical properties of natural fibers have distinct properties; depending upon the cellulosic content of the fibers which varies from fiber to fiber. The mechanical properties of composites are influenced mainly by the adhesion between matrix and fibers.

The modification of the interfacial adhesion between reinforcements and matrix resin by using functionalized polypropylene played a significant role in improving the mechanical properties of the composites.

METHODS: FRC made of E-glass fiber and BisGMA-PMMA resin matrix system was used in the study. Pieces of nonpolymerized FRC were coated with particulate bioactive glass granules S53P4 (BAG), and then the FRC was polymerized and post-cured by heat in air to reduce the quantity of residual monomers, and to sterilize the material for the animal study. Two round defects (5 mm in diameter) were drilled in the upper bony walls of 12 NZW rabbits&#039; frontal sinuses, and rectangular FRC plates were applied over the defects. In the control group, no FRC plates were used. The bone defect healing process was evaluated on histological sections at 3, 6, and 8 weeks, postoperatively. SEM-EDX analysis was used to determine reactive layers of bioactive glass granules. RESULTS: The healing progressed from the fibroconnective tissue phase at 3 weeks to lamellar bone formation at 6 and 8 weeks. The difference in new bone formation between the implantation groups and control groups was not statistically significant, although in some animals the effect of the implant on bone healing was clearly positive. A moderate foreign body reaction was seen on the implant surface where BAG granules did not uniformly cover the implant&#039;s polymer matrix. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the tested FRC implant with bioactive glass coating provides an alternative for bone defect reconstruction. However, more research on this composite material and its biocompatibility is needed.",

This paper describes recent advances that led to the development of ISO 10303-209 data models for composite structural shape and composition. The paper also reports the status of ongoing implementation and testing efforts. Varied usage scenarios have motivated several areas for future improvement, such as full three-dimensional representation and the efficient cost-effective visualization of composite structural parts. Issues and their proposed solutions, along with their anticipated impacts on the design, analysis, manufacturing, and long-term support of composite structures are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "In the present paper results of a series of plate impact experiments designed to study spall strength in glass-fiber reinforced polymer composites (GRP) are presented. Two GRP architectures are investigated-S2 glass woven roving in Cycom 4102 polyester resin matrix and a balanced 5-harness satin weave E-glass in a Ciba epoxy (LY564) matrix. The GRP specimens were shock loaded using an 82.5 mm bore single-stage gas-gun. A velocity interferometer was used to measure the particle velocity profile at the rear (free) surface of the target plate. The spall strength of the GRP was obtained as a function of the normal component of the impact stress and the applied shear-strain by subjecting the GRP specimens to normal shock compression and combined shock compression and shear loading, respectively. The spall strengths of the two GRP composites were observed to decrease with increasing levels of normal shock compression. Moreover, superposition of shear-strain on the normal shock compression was found to be highly detrimental to the spall strength. The E-glass reinforced GRP composite was found to have a much higher level of spall strength under both normal shock compression and combined compression and shear loading when compared to the S2-glass GRP composite. The maximum spall strength of the E-glass GRP composite was found to be 119.5 MPa, while the maximum spall strength for the S2 glass GRP composite was only 53.7 MPa. These relatively low spall strength levels of the S2-glass and the E-glass fiber reinforced composites have important implications to the design and development of GRP-based light-weight integral armor. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The present investigation was undertaken to determine the reinforcing effect of woven glass fibers on deflection, flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength of acrylic denture base polymer. METHODS: Three silanized or unsilanized woven glass fibers were used. Specimens were made by heating the denture cure resin dough containing glass fibers, which were sheathed in the dough. Specimens with four different thicknesses and of five different types were made, incorporating the glass fiber. Three-point flexural test and flywheel type impact test were employed to determine the flexural properties and impact strength. RESULTS: When specimens contained unsilanized glass fiber, the flexural strength in specimens of 1 and 2 mm thickness and the impact strength in specimens of 2 mm thickness were higher than those of specimens without glass fiber (p &lt; 0.01). On the contrary, the flexural strength and deflection in specimens reinforced with silanized glass fiber of 1 mm thickness were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.05) than those of unreinforced specimens. Further, the impact strength in specimens reinforced with silanized glass fiber of 2 mm thickness was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) than that of unreinforced specimens. Statistically significant differences were found in the flexural strength (p &lt; 0.05) and in the impact strength (p &lt; 0.01) when specimens of 4 mm thickness were reinforced with two or three unsilanized glass fibers. SIGNIFICANCE: The reinforcement with glass fiber was effective in thin specimens, and the reinforcing effect increased with the increase of the number of glass fibers in the case of thick specimens.",

Dynamic mechanical properties showed an increase in storage modulus whereas the glass transition temperature showed no significant trend with glass incorporation. Furthermore, a significant increase in overall properties can be obtained without significantly change the glass transition temperature.

The effect of position and content of aramid layer on the impact properties of hybrid composites was examined by using driven dart impact tester. The surface-treated composites were prepared by treating the surface of aramid fiber with oxygen plasma and silane coupling agent. The trend of total impact energy was correlated to that of delamination area in both untreated and treated composites. The impact energy and delamination area of hybrid composites depended on the position of aramid layer. When aramid layer was at back surface, the composite exhibited the higher impact energy and delamination area. In surface-treated composites, however, the position of aramid layer had a minor effect on the impact energy of hybrid composites. This was due to the restriction in deformation of aramid fiber. The impact behavior of four-layer hybrid composites was affected by the delamination area at each interface. The deformation at neighbored-aramid layers increased the deformation at adjacent interfaces. (C) 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",

Structural functions include mechanical properties like strength, stiffness, fracture toughness, and damping, while non-structural functions include electrical and/or thermal conductivity, sensing and actuation, energy harvesting/storage, self-healing capability, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, recyclability and biodegradability. Many of these recent developments are associated with polymeric composite materials and corresponding advances in nanomaterials and nanostructures, as are many of the articles reviewed. The article concludes with a discussion of recent applications of multifunctional materials and structures, such as morphing aircraft wings, structurally integrated electronic components, biomedical nanoparticles for dispensing drugs and diagnostics, and optically transparent impact absorbing structures.

The effects of water and GF on the wear properties of the hybrid composite have been discussed. It was found that the glass fiber/polyetheretherketone composite showed excellent tribological performance in water lubrication. High wear resistance and low friction coefficient were achieved under a wide range of applied load. The glass fibers bore the main load between the contact surfaces and protected the matrix from further severe abrasion of the counterpart. At the same time, the cooling and boundary lubricating effects of water hindered the melting of glass fiber/polyetheretherketone surface layer which caused a great improvement in the trobological characteristic. Moreover, the transfer between the counterpart materials and the worn surface of the glass fiber/polyetheretherketone was inhibited accounting for the lower specific wear rate under water lubrication. The glass fiber/polyetheretherketone composite was characterized by mild scuffing and fiber protruding under water lubrication, while the plastic deformation and adhesion were significantly abated compared with those under dry sliding.",

Laser fusion joining is evaluated as a potential process to replace mechanical reinforcements used in conventional laminate composite fabrication. A two step laser process is developed to form fusion bonds between fibers within a single bundle and between adjacent fiber bundles. Coupled heat transfer and viscous flow modeling is carried out to investigate the temperature and dynamics of the joining process under three experimentally observed conditions. Linear elastic finite element analysis is used to investigate the effect of joint morphology on stress concentrations and strength. Joint strength is found to be a function of the fiber contact angle and packing density at the joint interface. Tensile tests show that laser joined fiber bundle strength is on the same order of magnitude as the raw fiber bundles.

Two-parameter Weibull distribution function was used to analysis statistically the fatigue life results of composite samples. Weibull graphics were plotted for each sample using fatigue data. Then, S–N curves were drawn for different reliability levels (R=0.99, R=0.50, R=0.368, R=0.10) using these data. These S–N curves were introduced for the identification of the first failure time as reliability and safety limits for the benefit of designers. The probabilities of survival graphics were obtained for several stress and fatigue life levels.

A better control of powder morphology also produces ceramic grains in the submicron range enabling the production of nanocomposites with electroactive properties.

The resulting composites show a hierarchical structure, where the structural glass fibers, which have diameters in micrometer range, are coated with CNTs having diameters around 10-20 nm. The stable aqueous dispersions of CNTs were produced using a novel ozonolysis and ultrasonication technique that results in dispersion and functionalization in a single step. Ozone-oxidized CNTs were then chemically reacted with a polyethyleneimine (PEI) dendrimer to enable cathodic EPD and promote adhesion between the CNTs and the glass-fiber substrate. Deposition onto the fabric was accomplished by placing the fabric in front of the cathode and applying a direct current (DC) field. Microscopic characterization shows the integration of CNTs throughout the thickness of the glass fabric, where individual fibers are coated with CNTs and a thin film of CNTs also forms on the fabric surfaces. Within the composite, networks of CNTs span between adjacent fibers, and the resulting composites exhibit good electrical conductivity and considerable increases in the interlaminar shear strength, relative to fiber composites without integrated CNTs. Mechanical, chemical and morphological characterization of the coated fiber surfaces reveal interface/interphase modification resulting from the coating is responsible for the improved mechanical and electrical properties. The CNT-coated glass-fiber laminates also exhibited clear changes in electrical resistance as a function of applied shear strain and enables self-sensing of the transition between elastic and plastic load regions.",

          "abstract": "Natural fibers are emerging as low cost, lightweight and apparently environmentally superior alternatives to glass fibers in composites. We review select comparative life cycle assessment studies of natural fiber and glass fiber composites, and identify key drivers of their relative environmental performance. Natural fiber composites are likely to be environmentally superior to glass fiber composites in most cases for the following reasons: (1) natural fiber production has lower environmental impacts compared to glass fiber production; (2) natural fiber composites have higher fiber content for equivalent performance, reducing more polluting base polymer content; (3) the light-weight natural fiber composites improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions in the use phase of the component, especially in auto applications; and (4) end of life incineration of natural fibers results in recovered energy and carbon credits.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The flexural strength of two commercially available dental fiber-reinforced composites (FRC) (glass fiber-reinforced composite material), one unidirectional and the other bidirectional, were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten uniform beams of core materials and ten beams of laminated core materials were fabricated for FibreKor and Vectris Frame. The specimens were subjected to a three-point bending test. Flexural strength for both FRC materials was determined with and without their composite laminations. The strength data were analyzed using the Weibull method. Modes of failure for both systems were determined using SEM. RESULTS: The strength of FibreKor was significantly greater than that of Vectris Frame when comparing the core materials with and without their respective composite laminations. Mode of failure of FibreKor was predominantly debonding with fiber fracture. Vectris Frame did not exhibit debonding failure. Mode of failure for Vectris Frame was fiber fracture with delamination and matrix microfracture. CONCLUSION: FibreKor, a unidirectional FRC, demonstrated higher flexural strength than Vectris Frame, a bidirectional FRC. Debonding of fibers from the matrix possibly contributed to toughening mechanisms such as crack deflection, fiber pullout, and fiber bridging in FibreKor.",

In order to keep pace with the application of FRP composites in Civil Engineering field, this research was undertaken to reveal more knowledge about the environmental degradation of FRP composite bridge under hot/wet environment. By gravimetric experiments, the moisture diffusion in thin-section of FRP composites and adhesives were characterized. Based on the analytical model of one-dimensional moisture diffusion theory, the diffusion coefficients were determined by the best least-square curve fitting to the experimental data. The finite element (FE) models of test specimens were developed and validated against experimental results. Through transient FE diffusion analysis, the moisture diffusion into the FRP-steel composite bridge deck system under a hot/wet environment was numerically predicted up to 100-year aging duration. The moisture uptake in adhesive connection was fully saturated after 26-year aging. The area between FRP composite sections and the adhesive layer was confirmed to be the most sensitive part to moisture effects. This research developed a step towards the prediction of long-term performance and life-time estimation of FRP-steel composite bridges. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The various fields of application and the complex microstructures of such materials require better understanding of their micromechanical behavior under external loads. In this work, the tensile testing is coupled with the novel technique of surface displacement mapping via digital image correlation (DIC) is utilized for resolving the mechanical behavior and spatial distribution of the plastic microstrains in an epoxy resin reinforced with 35 wt% short borosilicate glass fibers. The DIC method works by correlating the digital images of surface patterns before and after straining. The material exhibited a pronounced mechanical anisotropy at both macro and mesoscale, which depends on the alignment of the fibers relative to the external load. The underlying microstructure of the material explained formation of strain gradients during evolution of full-field strain fields. The levels of localized strain are higher than the global failure strain of the material. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on the fracture surfaces revealed the multiple failure mechanisms of the material as a function of the fiber orientation. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The oxygen transfer characteristics of a composite membrane bubbleless aerator are evaluated. The hollow fiber composite membrane is hydrophobic microporous polyethylene with a 1 ??m thick non-porous polyurethane layer in the middle of the membrane wall that allows high gas pressure to be maintained inside the fiber without producing bubbles. When in contact with water, the membrane pores do not wet; they remain dry and gas-filled. Oxygen diffuses through both the gas-filled pores and the polyurethane, and is transferred to the liquid phase. The hollow fiber membranes provide a high specific surface area and as a result a high gas transfer rate can be achieved. During module operation, pure oxygen under high pressure is maintained on the lumen side of a bundle of individually sealed hollow fibers. Water to be oxygenated is pumped over the outside of the fibers. The high gas pressure can be used in the fibers to produce interfacial oxygen saturation concentrations that are more than an order of magnitude higher than typical oxygen saturation concentrations. In this study, the mass transfer characteristics of laboratory scale composite fiber modules are evaluated as a function of module design parameters and operating conditions. The following empirical design correlation can be used to estimate the mass transfer coefficients of composite fiber modules: Sh=0.056P0.735 Re0.645P-0.22Sc0.33 where P =operating pressure in psi. The correlation is developed using the data between the Reynolds number ranges from 2500 to 5500. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The turbine-blade cost-effectiveness has been defined using the cost of energy (CoE), i.e., a ratio of the three-blade HAWTrotor development/fabrication cost and the associated annual energy production. To assess the annual energy production as a function of the blade design and operating conditions, an aero- dynamics-based computational analysis had to be employed. As far as the turbine blade cost is concerned, it is assessed for a given aerodynamic design by separately computing the blade mass and the associated blade-mass/size-dependent production cost. For each aerodynamic design analyzed, a structural finite element-based and a post-processing life-cycle assessment analyses were employed in order to determine a minimal blade mass which ensures that the functional requirements pertaining to the quasi-static strength of the blade, fatigue-controlled blade durability and blade stiffness are satisfied. To determine the turbine- blade production cost (for the currently prevailing fabrication process, the wet lay-up) available data regarding the industry manufacturing experience were combined with the attendant blade mass, surface area, and the duration of the assumed production run. The work clearly revealed the challenges associated with simultaneously satisfying the strength, durability and stiffness requirements while maintaining a high level of wind-energy capture efficiency and a lower production cost.",

Though extensive research has been made on the performance evaluation of these composite materials, not much data is available on the moisture absorption of the composites, which restricts their use in exterior applications. This study aims to investigate the moisture absorption of short hemp fiber and hemp-glass hybrid reinforced thermoplastic composites to study their suitability in outdoor applications. The water absorption properties and its effect on the tensile properties of hemp and hemp/glass fiber hybrid polypropylene (PP) composites prepared by an injection molding process were investigated. Effect of hybridization on the water uptake and the kinetics of moisture absorption of the hemp fiber composites were evaluated by immersing the hybrid composite samples in distilled water at different temperatures, of 40, 60 and 80{degrees}C. The composites showed a Fickian mode of diffusion; however, a deviation was observed at higher temperature and may be attributed to the microcraks developed at the interface and dissolution of the lower molecular weight substances from the natural fibers. Equilibrium moisture content (Mm) showed that water up take of 40 wt% hemp fiber reinforced PP composites was highest and incorporation of glass fiber decreased the water uptake significantly (40%). Equilibrium moisture content was found to be independent of temperature, while diffusion coefficient (D) was increased with temperature. Effect of water absorption on the tensile properties of the composites showed that there is a significant reduction in strength and stiffness. It was observed that hybridization with glass fibers did not have any significant effect on the strength properties of the aged samples. The tensile properties of the re-dried aged samples showed an increased retention of strength properties after drying; however a complete recovery of the properties has not been achieved. This indicated that water absorption is not a physical process and permanent damage occurred to the composite after aging.",

This kind of composite materials are commonly used for automotive functional and structural applications. To this aim, a multi-scale experimental approach is developed. The deformation processes and the damage mechanisms observed at the microscopic scale are related to the material mechanical properties at the macroscopic scale. Tensile tests up to failure and specific interrupted tensile tests have been optimized and performed for high strain rates up to 200 s-1 to quantify the strain rate effect at different scales. High speed tensile tests have also been performed on the pure copolymer matrix. The threshold and the kinetic of damage have been quantified at both microscopic and macroscopic scales. Experimental results show that the composite behavior is strongly strain-rate dependent. The multi-scale analysis leads to the conclusion that the strain rate effect on the damage behavior of the EPC matrix composite is mainly due to the viscous behavior of the EPC matrix. SEM observations and analysis show that a localized deformation in the interface zone around fibers occurs at high strain rates and directly affects the visco-damage behavior. It is established that when the strain rate increases, the local deformation zone around the fibers behaves like a dissipation zone. Consequently, the damage initiation is delayed and the related kinetic is reduced with respect to the quasi-static loading case. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this work, sealing is assessed through use of a pressure cell apparatus to detect nitrogen flow through the thickness direction of a damaged composite. A controlled amount of microcracking is introduced through cyclic indentation of opposing surfaces of the sample. The resulting damage zone is proportional to the indentation load. We investigate the effect of DCPD microcapsule size and concentration on the self-sealing ability of plain weave E-glass epoxy composites. For 51 {micro}m diameter capsules (6.5 wt%), 67% of the self-sealing composite panels fully seal with no leaking, compared to 0% of the control panels with no sealing ability. When the amount of damage is reduced, 100% of the self-sealing samples resealed. Sealing performance decreases with smaller diameter capsules (18 {micro}m diameter) and lower capsule concentrations (2.7 wt%), indicating that there is a minimum capsule size and concentration to deliver enough healing agent to seal a given damage volume.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Direct-filling resin composites are used in relatively small restorations and are not recommended for large restorations with severe occlusal-stresses. The aim of this study was to reinforce composites with fiber preforms, and to investigate the effects of layer thickness and configurations on composite properties. It was hypothesized that fiber preforms would significantly increase the composite&#039;s flexural strength, work-of-fracture (toughness) and elastic modulus. Methods. Glass fibers were silanized, impregnated with a resin, cured, and cut to form inserts for tooth cavity restorations. Also fabricated were three groups of specimens of 2 mm ?? 2 mm ?? 25 mm: a fiber preform rod in the center of a hybrid composite; a thin fiber layer on the tensile side of the specimens; and a thin fiber layer sandwiched in between layers of a hybrid composite. These specimens were tested in three-point flexure to measure strength, work-of-fracture and modulus. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the restorations and the fiber distributions. Results. Microscopic examinations of insert-filled tooth cavities showed that the fibers were relatively uniform in distribution within the preform, and the inserts were well bonded with the surrounding hybrid composite. Specimens consisting of a fiber preform rod in the center of a hybrid composite had a flexural strength (mean (SD); n = 6) of 313 (19) MPa, significantly higher than 120 (16) MPa of the hybrid composite without fibers (Tukey&#039;s at family confidence of 0.95). The work-of-fracture was increased by nearly seven times, and the modulus was doubled, due to fiber preform reinforcement. Similar improvements were obtained for the other two groups of specimens. Significance. Substantial improvements in flexural strength, toughness and stiffness were achieved for dental resin composites reinforced with fiber preforms. The method of embedding a fiber preform insert imparts superior reinforcement to restorations and should improve the performance of direct-filling resin composites in large restorations with high occlusal-loads.

To provide effective and reliable results the analysis was accomplished on samples submitted to multiple impacts, then guaranteeing the same testing conditions for different impact levels. The analysis of the impact effect has been made by two parameters; amplitude response and time shift. PZT sensors have been bonded to the samples in a pitch-and-catch configuration and the Lamb wave symmetrical mode (S0) signal was used. The results demonstrate that the two evaluated parameters are able to characterise the different damage types occurring in these composites, as well as to evaluate their severity. It was also observed that amplitude predict well the defect size, whenever fiber-breakage occurs.",

          "abstract": "Most of the research to date has focused on tailoring the interphase adhesion by controlling the degree of chemical bonding between fiber and resin. The interfacial   shear strength (IFSS) has been increased as much as 40% by modified chemical surface bonding [1--3]. However, it is well known that increasing the interfacial   strength of the fiber reinforced polymeric composite material often leads to a reduction in the fracture toughness and vice versa [4--12]. In this study,   the effects of mechanical interlocking, in addition to chemical bonding on the strength and energy absorption of glass fiber/epoxy interphase, were studied by  creating texture on the fiber surface through the phase separation of silane blends. A series of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS)/3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPS) blends in solutions of ethanol and water was selected to treat the glass fiber surface. The   fiber coated with different surface treatments shows the change in fiber surface morphology due to the addition of TEOS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  analysis showed that the GPS preferentially migrates to the coating surface which suggests that phase separation induced by the silane blend was the primary mechanism for the texture formation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to scan the fiber   surface after the coating and the fiber surface texture was quantified by the roughness values. In addition, a single-fiber Microdroplet shear test was conducted   to assess the interfacial properties between the textured glass surface and an epoxy matrix. Traditionally, interfacial shear strength is the only quantity that was   determined from the load vs. displacement curve after microdroplet test. In this study, a new data-reduction scheme was developed to determine the energy absorption due to different failure mechanisms by taking into consideration both machine compliance and fiber stretching in the energy calculation. The results show as much as a three-fold increase in specific sliding energy absorption without sacrificing   interfacial shear strength. The examination of failure surfaces shows that failure mode propagates through the textured interphase in a more tortuous path, which   results in greater degree of energy absorption during fiber--matrix pullout. This study shows the potential for using chemical bonding and mechanical   interlocking effects to improve both strength and energy absorption in fiber reinforced composites.",

Glass fibers/epoxy laminae and aluminum foil (Glare) are commonly used to obtain these hybrid composites. The environmental factors can limit the applications of composites by deteriorating the mechanical properties during service. Usually, epoxy resins absorb moisture when exposed to humid environments and metals are prone to surface corrosion. Therefore, the combination of the two materials in Glare (polymeric composite and metal), can lead to differences that often turn out to be beneficial in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental influences. In this work, the viscoelastic properties, such as storage modulus (E???) and loss modulus (E???), were obtained for glass fiber/epoxy composite, aluminum 2024-T3 alloy and for a glass fiber/epoxy/aluminum laminate (Glare). It was found that the glass fiber/epoxy (G/E) composites decrease the E??? modulus during hygrothermal conditioning up to saturation point (6 weeks). However, for Glare laminates the E??? modulus remains unchanged (49 GPa) during the cycle of hygrothermal conditioning. The outer aluminum sheets in the Glare laminate shield the G/E composite laminae from moisture absorption, which in turn prevent, in a certain extent, the material from hygrothermal degradation effects. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "Research and development of coherent optical fiber communications have been accelerated mainly because of the possibility of receiver sensitivity improvement reaching 20 dB, and partly because of the possibility of frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) with very fine frequency separation. In this paper, recent advances in the research on coherent optical fiber communication systems are reviewed, with emphasis on those reported in the past two years. The bit-error rate measurements so far reported are classified and investigated in four categories: PCM-ASK, PCM-FSK, PCM-PSK, and PCM-DPSK. The states-of-the-art of polarization-state stabilization techniques is also discussed.",

The incorporation of a self-healing\n capability within a variety of materials, including fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs), has been\n investigated by a number of workers previously.

Self-healing of the\n damage site saw the laminate recover 87% of the undamaged baseline FRP laminate&#039;s strength.

          "abstract": "It is estimated that the annual world car production rate will reach 76. million vehicles per year by 2020. New regulations such as the EU End of Life Vehicles (ELV) regulations are forcing car manufacturers to consider the environmental impact of their production and possibly shift from the use of synthetic materials to the use of agro-based materials. Poor mechanical properties and certain manufacturing limitations currently limit the use of agro-based materials to non-structural and semi-structural automotive components. The hybridization of natural fiber with glass fiber provides a method to improve the mechanical properties over natural fibers alone. This research is focused on a hybrid of kenaf/glass fiber to enhance the desired mechanical properties for car bumper beams as automotive structural components with modified sheet molding compound (SMC). A specimen without any modifier is tested and compared with a typical bumper beam material called glass mat thermoplastic (GMT). The results indicate that some mechanical properties such as tensile strength, Young&#039;s modulus, flexural strength and flexural modulus are similar to GMT, but impact strength is still low, and shows the potential for utilization of hybrid natural fiber in some car structural components such as bumper beams. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The tensile properties and notched Charpy impact energy of injection-molded rubber-toughened polyamide 6,6/polypropylene (PA6,6/PP) blends reinforced with short glass fibers (SGF) were studied. The glass fiber content was fixed at 40 wt%. The polymer blends containing various PA6,6/PP ratios, plus a mixture of 10 wt% styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) and 10 wt% maleic anhydride (MA) grafted SEBS (SEBS-g-MA), were formulated. Two types (123D and 146B) of E-glass fibers were used to examine the influences of PA6,6/PP ratio on mean fiber length and critical fiber length (or fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion) and in turn on the mechanical properties. The PA6,6/PP ratio was found to have significant effects on both the mean fiber length and the critical fiber length in the final samples, and then on the mechanical properties. It was shown that the composite strength increased while the elastic modulus decreased with increasing PA6,6/PP ratio. This observation has been explained using the variance of interfacial adhesion and fiber length with the PA 6,6/PP ratio. The tensile failure strains were higher for the glass fiber-reinforced SEBS/SEBS-g-MA toughened blends than for glass fiber-reinforced toughened PA6,6 or PP composites. The notched Charpy impact energy of the reinforced blends at a medium (75/25) PA6,6/PP ratio was exhibited to be higher than for the reinforced rubber-toughened PA6,6 or PP composites. Consequently, it was concluded that control of the PA6,6/PP ratio would be an effective way to produce composites with optimal combination of superior overall mechanical properties. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The wear rates and friction coefficients against different metals and SiC papers were experimentally determined and the resulting wear mechanisms were microscopically observed. Three principal sliding directions relative to the dominant fiber orientation in the composite were selected. When sliding took place against smooth hard metals, the highest wear resistance and the lowest friction coefficient were observed in the antiparallel direction. For both the composite and the counterparts, the wear rates decreased as the hardness of the counterpart material increased. Two types of colored wear debris were observed and these played an important role in the wear mechanisms during sliding. The effects of sliding direction and grain size of the SiC paper on the abrasive wear characteristics of the carbon fiber-glass composite were also studied. The type of contact configuration affects the wear rates, especially in the parallel direction. In contrast to smooth metal, the wear rate of the composite in the antiparallel direction here was clearly higher than those in the other two directions. It was found that the dominant wear mechanism was in-plane bending of the fibers, which caused fiber fracture and cracking. ?? 1993.",

          "abstract": "This review focuses on recent advances in the development and use of bioactive glass for tissue engineering applications. Despite its inherent brittleness, bioactive glass has several appealing characteristics as a scaffold material for bone tissue engineering. New bioactive glasses based on borate and borosilicate compositions have shown the ability to enhance new bone formation when compared to silicate bioactive glass. Borate-based bioactive glasses also have controllable degradation rates, so the degradation of the bioactive glass implant can be more closely matched to the rate of new bone formation. Bioactive glasses can be doped with trace quantities of elements such as Cu, Zn and Sr, which are known to be beneficial for healthy bone growth. In addition to the new bioactive glasses, recent advances in biomaterials processing have resulted in the creation of scaffold architectures with a range of mechanical properties suitable for the substitution of loaded as well as non-loaded bone. While bioactive glass has been extensively investigated for bone repair, there has been relatively little research on the application of bioactive glass to the repair of soft tissues. However, recent work has shown the ability of bioactive glass to promote angiogenesis, which is critical to numerous applications in tissue regeneration, such as neovascularization for bone regeneration and the healing of soft tissue wounds. Bioactive glass has also been shown to enhance neocartilage formation during in vitro culture of chondrocyte-seeded hydrogels, and to serve as a subchondral substrate for tissue-engineered osteochondral constructs. Methods used to manipulate the structure and performance of bioactive glass in these tissue engineering applications are analyzed. ?? 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this review is to detail the progress made toward realizing an integrated approach in the design and manufacture of three-dimensional textile preforms. The survey begins by identifying the recent advances in textile manufacturing with particular attention paid to new developments in multi-axial weaving, multi-axial warp knitting, stitching and braiding along with their potential advantages and limitations. A summary of the various preform manufacturing techniques corresponding to the basic load-bearing structural elements is then given. Additionally, limited examples demonstrating the geometric constraints inherent with these techniques and their associated process windows are discussed. Finally, a brief mention of some of the analytical models developed to predict the thermoelastic properties of three-dimensional textile composites is made.",

Methods: The study population comprised 192 patients and 526 endodontically treated teeth, with various degrees of hard-tissue loss, restored by the post-and-core technique. Four groups were defined based on post shape and core build-up materials, and within each group post-and-core restorations were assigned randomly with respect to root morphology. Inclusion criteria were symptom-free endodontic therapy, root-canal treatment with a minimum apical seal of 4 mm, application of rubber dam, need for post-and-core complex because of coronal tooth loss, and tooth with at least one residual coronal wall. Survival rate of the post-and-core restorations was determined using Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis. Results: The restorations were examined clinically and radiologically; mean observation period was 5.3 years. The overall survival rate of glass-fiber post-and-core restorations was 98.5%. The survival rate for parallel-sided posts was 98.6% and for tapered posts was 96.8%. Survival rates for core build-up materials were 100% for dual-cure composite and 96.8% for hybrid light-cure composite. Conclusions: For both glass-fiber post designs and for both core build-up materials, clinical performance was satisfactory. Survival was higher for teeth retaining four and three coronal walls. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Fibers were oriented at a 45-degree angle to the long axis of the test specimens. Control specimens were unreinforced. Dry test specimens and those stored in water for up to 180 weeks were tested with a 3-point loading apparatus. RESULTS: Ultimate transverse strength and flexural modulus of unreinforced and fiber-reinforced composite test specimens decreased during water storage (P &lt; 0.001, analysis of variance). Post hoc analysis revealed that after the storage of 4 weeks no statistically significant reduction occurred. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the ultimate transverse strength of the fiber-reinforced composite made from E-glass fibers is reduced by approximately 27% compared to the dry fiber-reinforced composite. The majority of the reduction occurred during 4 weeks of storage in water and remained approximately at that level for 180 weeks.",

Vegetable fibers and their composites have attracted the attention of scientists worldwide because of their favorable properties. The different chemical modifications of natural fibers and characterization aspects have been discussed. The adhesion between fiber and matrix is a major factor in determining the response of the interface and its integrity under stress. Therefore characterization of the interface is of utmost importance. Both fiber surface and polymer matrix surface can be modified to obtain a strong interface. Various treatments being used for the lignocellulosic surfaces and the characterization techniques have been illustrated. The four main techniques of interfacial characterization that are enumerated in this article are the micromechanical techniques, spectroscopic, microscopic and swelling techniques. The micromechanical techniques like fiber pull-out and fragmentation have been dealt with giving emphasis to experimental aspects. Recent studies dealing with interfacial study of different lignocellulosic fiber reinforced composites have also been cited.",

The knitted preforms were made from GF/PP commingled yarn containing 50 vol% (approximate to 73 wt%)GF. Before hot pressing, the preforms were stretched in the wale direction at various ratios. The tensile properties of the pre-stretched GF-PP composites were studied. It was found that there is a critical value of pre-stretch ratio as far as tensile stiffness and tensile strength are concerned. On increasing the pre-stretch ratio within the range of this critical value, both tensile stiffness and tensile strength increase. If the pre-stretch ratio goes beyond this critical value and continues to increase, both tensile stiffness and tensile strength display a tendency of slight decrease because of the break of more glass fibers. The failure strain of the composites decreases with the increase of the pre-stretch ratio because of the decrease of the stretchability of the knitted reinforcements.",

The corrected experimental fiber length distribution and the predicted and experimental orientation distributions were used in modeling to compute the elastic properties of the composite. First, from the fiber length distribution (FLD) data in terms of number of fibers versus fiber length, the probability density functions were built and used in the computation. The two-parameter Weibull&#039;s distribution was also used to represent the actual FLD. Next, the Mori—Tanaka model that employs the Eshelby&#039;s equivalent inclusion method was applied to calculate the stiffness matrix of the aligned fiber composite containing the established FLD. The stiffness of the actual as-formed composite was then determined from the stiffness of the computed aligned fiber composite that was averaged over all possible orientations using the orientation averaging method. The methodology to predict the elastic properties of LFTs was validated via experimental verification of the longitudinal and transverse moduli determined for long glass fiber injection-molded polypropylene specimens. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effect of a variation of FLD on the composite elastic properties. Our analysis shows that it is essential to obtain an accurate fiber orientation distribution and a realistic fiber length distribution to accurately predict the composite properties.",

Methods: Two composite resins (Q: Quixfil and A: Adoro) were used to fabricate 2 mm ?? 2 mm ?? 25 mm beams (N = 10), reinforced with two fiber bundles along the long axis of the beam and pre-tensioned under a load equivalent to 73.5% of its tensile strength (groups QPF and APF). In two other experimental groups, the bundles were similarly positioned but without pre-tension (groups QF and AF). Two more groups were included without fiber reinforcement (control groups Q and A). After 24 h storage, specimens were subjected to a three-point flexural bending test to establish the flexural module, the deflection at initial failure and the flexural strength. Data were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (composite resin system and fiber reinforcement type) and the Tukey HSD post hoc tests (?? = .05). Results: The results showed that prestressing increased the flexural module of Adoro specimens (p &lt; .001) but not Quixfil (p = .17). Prestressed beams reached greater deflection at initial failure than those conventionally reinforced (p &lt; .001), namely .85-1.35 mm for Adoro and .66-.90 mm for Quixfil. Prestressing also significantly increased the flexural strength of beams (p &lt; .001) in both Adoro and Quixfil groups, from 443.46 to 569.15 MPa and from 425.47 to 568.00 MPa, respectively. Significance: Pre-tensioning of unidirectional glass fibers increased both deflection until initial failure and flexural strength of Quixfil and Adoro composite resins, however, with limited effects on the flexural modulus. ?? 2009 Academy of Dental Materials.",

Particularly, bamboo fibers have been used for industrial applications as diverse as textiles, paper, and construction. Recent renewed interest in bamboo fiber (BF) is primarily targeted for the replacement or reduction in use of glass fiber from non-renewable resources. In this review, various mechanical, chemical, and biological approaches for the preparation and separation of macro-, micro-, and nano-sized fibers from raw bamboo are summarized. The differences in the mechanical, thermal, and other properties of fibers from different materials are linked to their size, aspect ratio, surface charge and groups, and their function in nature. Biocomposites made of BF are considered to be green, environmentally responsible eco-products. Different processing parameters such as fiber extraction, surface modification, and synthesis of the composites affect the characteristics of composites. Fiber length, orientation, concentration, dispersion, aspect ratio, selection of matrix, and chemistry of the matrix must all be considered during fabrication in order to achieve desirable functionalities and performance. Because of the hydrophilic nature of BF, different methods may be adopted to improve interfacial surface adhesion. A better understanding of the fiber structure and characteristics that influence composite performance could lead to the development of additives, coatings, binders, or sizing suitable for natural fiber and a variety of polymeric matrices.",

METHODS: Veneering composites with different fillers, matrices and polymerization methods (Belleglass Kerr Inc., Orange, CA, USA; Sculpture, Pentron Inc. Wallingford CT, USA; Sinfony, 3M Espe, Seefeld, Germany; SR Adoro LC and HP, Targis, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), a glass-fiber framework material (Vectris Pontic VP, Ivoclar Vivadent) and a direct restorative composite control (Tetric Ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent) were selected. For the first part of the study, 30 bar specimens (25 x 2 x 2 mm3) per material were fabricated. Ten were stored for 24 h and 10 for 14 days in water at 37 degrees C. Ten were thermocycled (3000 x; 5-50-5 degrees C). Three-point bending tests (crosshead speed: 0.5 mm/min) were performed. For the second part of the study, all veneering materials were combined with a glass-fiber framework (VP). Sixty specimens were produced for each material (25 x 4 x 2 mm3) and treated as in the first part. Three-point bend tests were performed with the reinforcing glass-fiber framework either on the tension or the compression side. Data was evaluated by ANOVA and Weibull analysis. RESULTS: A decrease in flexural strength was observed after water storage or thermocycling for all veneering materials tested. None of the tested materials exhibited significant advantages compared to the control. The flexural strength of glass-fiber reinforced frameworks was ten times higher and not influenced by water storage or thermocycling. A significant reinforcing effect from glass fibers was observed when they were placed on the tension but not when placed on the compression side. SIGNIFICANCE: A glass-fiber framework on the tension side significantly improved the flexural strength of veneering composites.

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: With advances in adhesive dentistry and current emphasis on esthetic restorations, dowel systems have been developed to take advantage of these new techniques. Of interest when using these systems is the interaction between core materials and post materials. This investigation compared the tensile retentive force of two resin composite core materials to two metallic and one non-metallic prefabricated endodontic posts. Two dimensions of core build-up and two post-surface treatments were tested.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty posts (stainless steel, titanium alloy, and glass fiber-impregnated resin) were secured in a jig with 4 mm of the post extending into a cylindrical matrix. The matrix formed cylinders with diameters of 3 and 5 mm into which resin composite was inserted. The posts were treated or not treated with a bonding agent. After storage for 24 hours at 100% humidity, five specimens per condition were tested in an Instron testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Failure loads were recorded in kilograms and failure modes were observed under light microscopy (40 x). Four-way analysis of variance and multiple comparison testing were used to compare means at the 0.05 level of significance.\n\nRESULTS: The means and standard deviations of tensile loads were calculated. All variables were significant in either main effects or interactions ( p&lt;0.05). Fisher&#039;s PLSD intervals for post, core, treatment, and diameter were 2.0, 1.6, 1.6, and 1.6 kg, respectively. In most cases, the retentive force recorded for metallic posts was higher than that of glass fiber posts. Titanium posts had higher retentive forces than did the stainless steel posts. For metallic posts, 5-mm cores provided higher forces than 3-mm cores. In the glass fiber group, core diameter was not significant. For core materials, Build-It gave higher results with stainless steel posts, and FluoroCore gave higher results with the titanium ones. The surface treatment results were mixed. In the metallic post groups the adhesive failure data ranged between 80% and 100%, whereas in the glass fiber post groups, adhesive failures ranged between 60% and 70%.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the metallic post groups always provided higher tensile retentive forces, with the titanium post groups showing higher retentive forces than the stainless steel ones. In the glass fiber post groups, different core diameters did not affect retention values.",

          "abstract": "An investigation on the application of the piezoelectric Macro-Fiber-Composite (MFC) actuators for the suppression of the noise transmission through the curved glass plates is presented. It is known that when the incident sound wave in the air hits the glass plate or curved plate or shell, part of the acoustic wave is reflected, which makes the plate vibrate, and part of the wave is transmitted. It is easy to understand that the higher the flexural rigidity of the glass plate the bigger part of the acoustic sound wave is reflected than transmitted. This simple physical phenomenon can be profitably used for the suppression of the noise transmission through glass plates. The noise suppression effect is achieved using the MFC actuator, which is attached to the vibrating glass plate. When the piezoelectric MFC actuator is shunted by the active electronic circuit, which has a negative capacitance, it is possible to greatly suppress the vibration of the glass plate and also the noise transmission through the glass plate. The sound shielding efficiency of the glass plate is measured by the acoustic transmission loss (TL), which is expresed in decibel scale. If the amplitude of the window vibrations decreases, the value of TL increases. The effect of the glass plate geometry, and the electrical properties of the active shunt circuit on the enhancement of TL is analyzed using Finite Element Method numerical simulations. The comparison of the results of numerical simulations with acoustic measurements is presented. The possibility of the use of this method for the suppression of the noise transmission through the glass window plates is discussed.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the flexural and impact properties of kenaf-glass (KG) fibers reinforced unsaturated polyester (UPE) hybrid composite on a source of green composite. The matrix is kept constant with 70 % volume fraction while kenaf and glass fibers were varied, such as 7.5/22.5 v/v, 15/15 v/v and 22.5/7.5 v/v. The 30 % kenaf and 30 % glass are also used for the preparation of composite materials. The kenaf fiber was treated with 6% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) diluted solution for 3 hours. Hybrid composites are fabricated using sheet molding compound (SMC) process. The mechanical tests, such as flexural and impact are performed using ASTM D790-03 and ASTM D256-04 respectively. The study showed that the highest flexural strength was obtained from treated kenaf with 15/15 v/v KG fiber reinforced hybrid composite while untreated of 15/15 v/v KG composite showed the highest value of impact strength in this investigation. This can be concluded that 15/15 v/v KG fiber reinforced unsaturated polyester hybrid composite is the most appropriate hybrid composite which can be considered for many engineering structural applications, such as automotive, aerospace, construction or sports. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a critical study on the sensing characteristics of piezoelectric fiber composite transducers (PFCTs), in order to evaluate them as an effective embedded sensor inside the composite structures to monitor the stress/strain concentration levels at the critical locations. The functions of PFCT as an embedded sensor inside the composite structure are threefold: (i) to detect all loading conditions acting on to the structure, (ii) to predict the occurrence of damage while in-service under dynamic loads, and (iii) to monitor the pre-existing damages in the composite structures so that the severity can be ascertained to avoid eventual catastrophic or brittle failures. PFCT will be an ideal choice for composite structures applications, as they are highly flexible, easily embeddable; their high compatibility to the composite manufacturing techniques, and more importantly, it is expected that they will produce significantly less interfacial stresses when embedded inside the composite structures. Two types of PFCTs (macro fiber composite (MFC – from Smart Materials Corp.), and piezoelectric fiber composite (PFC – from Advance Cerametrics Inc.)) have been selected and calibrated by investigating their sensor performances based on characteristics; like transfer function, sensitivity, nonlinearity, resolution, and noise levels. Dynamic loads (transverse and longitudinal) have been applied and their corresponding output response is evaluated. The sensitivity of these products to the changes in frequencies and strain levels of input dynamic loads is investigated through the constant strain and frequency curves. Healthy voltage output response is observed even at low strain level domains, which indicates their high sensitivity and high resolution as a sensor. Comparing the results, it can be concluded that these sensors demonstrated their superior sensitivity and better performance over the traditional strain gauges. After a detailed sensor performance assessment, a case study has been conducted on the composite beam structure, where the ability of the PFCTs to detect the delamination of various levels inside the composite beam structure through modal analysis has been investigated. Then tests were performed to investigate the ability of the embedded PFCT sensors to detect the changes in the applied input mechanical stress/strain when embedded inside glass fiber–epoxy composite laminate samples. It is found that these sensors are effectively able to detect the changes in the applied input mechanical stress/strain. A linear relationship has been observed between the applied input mechanical stress and the sensor generated voltage output.",

          "abstract": "Polyamide 6 nanocomposites (PA6/NC) are novel type of composite materials comprising extremely thin, &quot; nanometer scale &quot; dispersions of smectitic silicate platelets. We prepared such PA6/NC materials via a melt compounding technique using suitably organomodified montmorillonite or hectorite type clays. The high surface to volume ratio of such thin silicate dispersions in PA6/NC leads to a high reinforcement efficiency even at 2 to 5 wt% of clay, achieving high specific modulus, strength and heat distortion temperature under load (DTUL). In addition, the platelet orientation and their surface nucleation effects seem to promote a faster crystallization and higher crystallinity in PA-6/NC (particularly at the surface and in thin-wall injection moldings), as compared to the standard PA-6. Such morpho-logical features in PA-6/NC also result in improved moisture resistance. Recogniz-ing these benefits, we investigated the use of PA-G/NC as a matrix for making both short and long glass fiber (GF) reinforced composites. Signifkant improvements in modulus were achievable in both the dry and the moisture conditioned state for PA-G/NC compared to standard PA-6, at any given level of glass fiber reinforce-ment. In general a small amount (3-4 wtYo) of the nanometer scale dispersed clay is capable of replacing up to 40 wtYo of a standard mineral filler or 10-15 wtVo of glass fiber in PA-6 composites to give equivalent stiffness at a lower density or a lower part weight advantage. In addition, improved moisture resistance, permeation banier and fast crystallization/mold cycle time contribute to the usefulness of such composites.",

Increasing use of these structural parts has given rise to the need for tests to identify characteristics of their fatigue behavior. The aim of this study was to determine fatigue data, and observe macroscopic and microscopic damage mechanisms of filament-wound composite tubes under axial cyclic loading. For this purpose, fatigue lives of the epoxy matrix, ??55?? glass fiber-wound specimens are determined for stress levels of 60, 70, and 80% of their tensile strength. Three different frequencies; 0.1, 1, and 10 Hz, were applied at each stress level for the constant amplitude sinusoidal loading with a stress ratio of R = 0.1. Results were evaluated in the form of S-N curves to reveal the effects of stress level and loading frequency on the three stages of fatigue damage. These stages observed were; first craze initiation in the matrix, then craze propagation and densification along the fiber winding direction, and finally breakage in the fibers leading to disintegration. Fatigue lives of the specimens decreased with an increase in the stress level, while they were generally increased by increasing the frequency. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods: Experimental composite resin was prepared by mixing 22.5 wt% of short E-glass fibers (3 mm in length) to the 22.5 wt% of resin matrix with various weight fractions of nanofillers (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 wt%) and then 55 wt% of silane treated silica filler were added gradually using high speed mixing machine. Another study group contained composite resin prepared by mixing 22.5 wt% of resin matrix (without nanofillers) to 77.5 wt% of filler particles (without fiber fillers). As control material, commercial particulate filler composite resin was used. The shrinkage strain of the specimens was measured using the bonded-disk technique at 26 and 37 °C with respect to time. Degree of conversion of the experimental composites containing different nanofiller fractions was measured using FTIR spectroscopy. Results: ANOVA revealed that fraction of nanofillers and polymerization temperature had significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) on the shrinkage strain and degree of conversion of the composite resin. Shrinkage strain correlated with nanofiller fraction and polymerization temperature (r2 = 0.96 and 0.95). Significance: The use of high nanofiller fraction with short fiber fillers and IPN-polymer matrix yielded improved rate of shrinkage strain. © 2007.",

In an initial pilot study, bioactive glass fiber/polysulfone composites and all-polysulfone control rods were implanted into the rabbit tibia; the study was subsequently expanded with implantation into the rabbit femur. Bone tissue exhibited direct contact with the glass fibers and adjacent polymer matrix and displayed a mechanical bond between the composite and bone tissue after six weeks implantation. Interfacial bond strengths after six weeks implantation averaged 12.4 MPa, significantly higher than those of the all-polymer controls. Failure sites for the composite at six weeks generally occurred in the bone tissue or composite, whereas the failure site for the polymer implants occurred exclusively at the implant/tissue interface. The bioactive glass fiber/polysulfone composite achieved fixation to bone tissue through a triple mechanism: a bond to the bioactive glass fiber, mechanical interlocking between the tissue and glass fibers, and close apposition and possible chemical bond between the portions of the polymer and bone tissue. This last mechanism resulted from an overspill of bioactivity reactions from the fibers onto the surface of the surrounding polymer which we call the &quot;halo&quot; effect.",

          "abstract": "The environmental performance of hemp based natural fiber mat thermoplastic (NMT) has been evaluated in this study by quantifying carbon storage potential and CO2 emissions and comparing the results with commercially available glass fiber composites. Non-woven mats of hemp fiber and polypropylene matrix were used to make NMT samples by film-stacking method without using any binder aid. The results showed that hemp based NMT have compatible or even better strength properties as compared to conventional flax based thermoplastics. A value of 63 MPa for flexural strength is achieved at 64% fiber content by weight. Similarly, impact energy values (84-154 J/m) are also promising. The carbon sequestration and storage by hemp crop through photosynthesis is estimated by quantifying dry biomass of fibers based on one metric ton of NMT. A value of 325 kg carbon per metric ton of hemp based composite is estimated which can be stored by the product during its useful life. An extra 22% carbon storage can be achieved by increasing the compression ratio by 13% while maintaining same flexural strength. Further, net carbon sequestration by industrial hemp crop is estimated as 0.67 ton/h/year, which is compatible to all USA urban trees and very close to naturally, regenerated forests. A comparative life cycle analysis focused on non-renewable energy consumption of natural and glass fiber composites shows that a net saving of 50 000 MJ (???3 ton CO2 emissions) per ton of thermoplastic can be achieved by replacing 30% glass fiber reinforcement with 65% hemp fiber. It is further estimated that 3.07 million ton CO2 emissions (4.3% of total USA industrial emissions) and 1.19 million m3 crude oil (1.0% of total Canadian oil consumption) can be saved by substituting 50% fiber glass plastics with natural fiber composites in North American auto applications. However, to compete with glass fiber effectively, further research is needed to improve natural fiber processing, interfacial bonding and control moisture sensitivity in longer run. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Two different fiber coatings, namely tin dioxide and boron nitride, were investigated. The presence of the coatings on the fiber led to an improvement in mechanical behavior. In particular, the boron nitride coating improved the total work of fracture of the composite without reducing the strength. A marked difference was observed in the fractographic features between the uncoated and tin-dioxide-coated samples as compared to the boron-nitride-coated samples. The uncoated and tin-dioxide-coated fiber composites failed in a brittle fashion, without any fiber pull-out, whereas the boron-nitride-coated fiber samples exhibited extensive fiber pull-out. This improvement in the toughness or energy absorbed during the fracture process was attributed to the relatively weak bonding between the fiber and matrix, induced as a result of the coating. ?? 1992.",

          "abstract": "Summary: Long glass fiber reinforced PA6 (LGF/PA6) prepregs were prepared by impregnating PA6 oligomer melt into reinforcing glass fiber followed by subsequent solid-state polymerization (SSP) to obtain LGF/PA6 composite pellets. A conventional injection-molding machine suitable for short glass fiber reinforced composites was applied to the processing of the prepared composites, which reduced the fiber length in the final products. Mechanical properties, thermal property, and fiber length distribution of injection molding bars were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the impact fracture surfaces and the surfaces of glass fiber after the SSP. It was found that the LGF/PA6 composites were of favorable mechanical properties, especially the impact strength, although the average length of glass fiber was rather short. By this novel process, the content of glass fiber in composite could be high up to 60 wt.-% and the maximum level of heat distortion temperature (HDT) was close to the melting temperature of PA6. SEM images indicated the favorable interfacial properties between the glass fiber and matrix. The glass fiber surfaces were further observed by SEM after removing the matrix PA6 with a solvent, the results showed that PA6 macromolecules were grafted onto the surface. Furthermore, the grafting amount of PA6 was increased with SSP time.

A one-dimensional model for the energy necessary to initiate/nucleate an interfacial crack from its associated transverse fiber break during a single fiber fragmentation test is proposed. The interface energy for the initiation of debonding is shown to be a function of the fiber and matrix geometrical and material characteristics, and of the initial debonding length. The validity of the approach is demonstrated in the case of fragmentation of sized and unsized E-glass fibers embedded in an UV-cured polymeric matrix.",

The bone defect healing process and inflammatory reactions were evaluated histologically at 4 and 12 weeks postoperatively. Possible neuropathological effects on brain tissue were evaluated. The release of residual monomers from the fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). RESULTS: At 4 weeks postoperatively, fibrous connective tissue ingrowth to implant structures was seen. Healing had started as new bone formation from defect margins, as well as woven bone islets in the middle of the defect. Woven bone was also seen inside the implant. Inflammation reaction was slight. At 12 weeks, part of the new bone had matured to lamellar-type, and inflammation reaction was slight to moderate. Control defects had healed by fibrous connective tissue. Histological examinations of the brain revealed no obvious damage to brain morphology. In HPLC analysis, the release of residual 1,4-butanedioldimethacrylate and methylmethacrylate from polymerized FRC was low. CONCLUSIONS: This FRC-implant was shown to promote the healing process of critical size calvarial bone defect in rabbits. After some modifications to the material properties, this type of implant has the potential to become an alternative for the reconstruction of bone defects in the head and neck area in the future.",

However, there are concerns about the long-term performance of carbon FRP-wood hybrid materials, the durability of carbon fiber reinforcement when subjected to environmental conditions and wood preservatives, as well as the carbon FRP-wood interface susceptibility to delamination. The objective of this paper is: (a) to characterize a carbon/vinyl ester composite for reinforcement of wood members based on material and interface performance properties; (b) to assess the suitability of the VARTM/SCRIMP process for wood reinforcement; and (c) to measure property retention after exposure to oil-borne wood preservative treatments. Vinyl ester resin produces a durable composite with properly sized carbon fibers and durable wood adhesive bonds when wood is treated with a hydroxymethyl resorcinol coupling agent. The carbon/vinyl ester-wood interface properties were superior to E-glass/vinyl ester-wood interface properties. The implemented VARTM/SCRIMP technology proved to be a manufacturing process with potential for producing carbon FRP-wood hybrid structural members resulting in a reinforcement with high fiber-to-resin ratio, minimum void content and a durable adhesive bond-to-wood substrates. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Two types of hybrid boron/glass/aluminum FMLs were fabricated and studied, which consisted of aluminum alloy sheets as the metal layers and a mixture of boron fibers and glass fibers as the composite layers. For the first type, the boron fiber/prepreg and the glass fiber/prepreg were used separately in the composite layers, and for the second type, the boron fibers and the glass fibers were mingled together to form a hybrid boron/glass/prepreg composite layer. These hybrid FMLs were consolidated using an autoclave curing process. The incorporation of the boron fibers improved the Young&#039;s modulus of the composite layer in FMLs, which in turn, would improve the fatigue crack initiation life of the Al sheet. The experimental results clearly showed that the fatigue crack initiation lives for both types of hybrid boron/glass/aluminum FMLs were superior to the monolithic aluminum alloy under the same loading condition. An analytical approach was proposed to calculate the fatigue crack initiation lives of hybrid boron/glass/aluminum FMLs based on the classical laminate theory and the small-crack theory. A good correlation was obtained between the predictions and the experimental results. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The flexural modulus increased at a fiber content of &lt;10 wt %, but there is a decrease beyond 10 wt %. The tensile modulus increases with fiber content until a maximum at 13.5 wt %, and then it decreases.

The technique, known as micro-CT (for computerized tomography), was used to measure the fiber length distribution (FLD) and fiber orientation distribution (FOD), two parameters that are critical to the behavior of short-fiber-reinforced composites. Phenolic foam reinforced with short glass fibers was used as an exemplar to demonstrate the potential of this technique, exploiting the large difference in density between the two components. Direct 2D and 3D images were generated in which individual fibers were clearly resolved, along with portions of the foam structure. The images were analyzed using computer software to obtain quantitative FLD and FOD data. A distinct preferred orientation of fibers was revealed that was attributed to shear flow during foam expansion.

          "abstract": "This work describes the results of experiments performed to determine a complete set of independent elastic constants and the effect of shock-induced shear strain on the delamination strength of a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic composite (GRP). The set of elastic constants are utilized to determine the delamination strength of the composite from the experimentally obtained stress-wave profiles in the composite. The principal results of this work may be summarized as follows: (i) the elastic wave velocity data indicate that the composite has tetragonal symmetry; (ii) the deformation of the composite under shock-wave compression normal to lay-up direction is elastic to 1-3 GPa; (iii) the composite needs to be pre-shock compressed to 0.07 GPa in order to delaminate GRP under rarefaction induced tension; (iv) the delamination strength of the composite decreases with an increase in the shock-induced shear, i.e. whereas the delamination strength of the composite under zero induced shear strain is 0.06 GPa, its magnitude decreases to 0.007 GPa under shock-induced shear strain of 0.002.",

Teeth were endodontically treated and prepared for ceramic restorations fabricated by the injection technique(IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar-Vivadent), forming the GC and GE groups. Specimens were mount-ed in a universal test machine (EMIC) and were submitted to an oblique compression load, at an angle of 135 degrees to the long axis of the tooth, until failure. Statistical evaluation performed by the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test showed significant differences between the two groups (p=0.002), with Group GE shown to be more resistant to compressive forces than Group GC. The pre-dominant failure pattern in both groups was fracture of the tooth on the side of force application and/or consequent displacement of the restoration on the opposite side.",

The model accounts for elastic fibers embedded in a thermoplastic resin that exhibits the elastic--plastic behavior obeying the Ramberg--Osgood relation and J-2 deformation theory of plasticity. It also accounts for fiber length and orientation distributions in the composite formed by the injection-molding process. Fiber orientation was predicted using an anisotropic rotary diffusion model recently developed for LFTs. An incremental procedure using Eshelby&#039;s equivalent inclusion method and the Mori--Tanaka assumption is applied to compute the overall stress increment resulting from an overall strain increment for an aligned-fiber composite that contains the same fiber volume fraction and length distribution as the actual composite. The incremental response of the latter is then obtained from the solution for the aligned-fiber composite by averaging over all fiber orientations. Failure during incremental loading is predicted using the Van Hattum--Bernado model that is adapted to the composite elastic--plastic behavior. The model is validated against the experimental stress--strain results obtained for long-glass-fiber/polypropylene specimens.",

The materials (E-glass fibers and denture base polymer) were stored in water for 14 or 30days or left dry. Water contact angles of the materials before and after water storage were determined. Test specimens, with or without parotid saliva or serum pellicle, were incubated in a suspension of S. mutans allowing initial adhesion to occur. Bacterial adhesion and multiplication was studied using scanning electron microscopy. Contact angles of both materials were significantly reduced after water storage indicating an increase in surface free energy. When studied without a surface pellicle, water storage significantly increased adhesion of S. mutans to both glass and polymer. Saliva coating of the materials resulted in higher degree of adhesion to glass fibers in comparison with polymer and after 14 days water storage glass bound over twice as much S. mutans cells than the polymer matrix. Bacterial growth and biofilm formation occurred equally on both materials. The results of this in vitro study suggest that in order to avoid the possible increase in S. mutans adhesion, the reinforcing glass fibers should be covered with the matrix polymer of the composite.

Two fiber geometries, namely [??45??]4 and [0/90??]2s stitch bonded glass fibers were studied. The results revealed that even low energy impact could seriously impair the tensile properties of [??45??]4 composites. For the [0/90??]2s glass fiber composites, a critical impact energy was found. Below this energy level the tensile properties were hardly affected by the impact but above it the tensile properties reduced with increasing energy. Low velocity impact also reduced the fatigue lives of the composites and this reduction could be related to the degradation in tensile strength. By normalizing the fatigue stress against the post-impact residual tensile strength of the composite, it was found that for each fiber geometry a single S-N curve could be drawn, which encompassed both undamaged and impacted samples. This implies that fatigue lifetimes of impact damaged composites can be predicted from measurement of the residual tensile strength of impacted specimens and the S-N curve of undamaged samples. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, pin-on-ring configuration with SiC abrasive paper was used under dry contact condition. The effects of three grades of SiC abrasive paper (1500, 1000, and 400) and the orientations (antiparallel, AP; parallel, P; normal, N) of the CSM on the m-2BA wear behaviour were investigated. The m-2BA wear rates of the CGRP composite were measured as a function of different applied normal loads (5-25 N corresponding to 0.037-0.19 MPa) at rotational speed of 100 and 50 rpm for different CSM orientations and different grit sizes of abrasive grains. Experimental results showed that m-2BA wear rate of the CGRP composite increases substantially with increasing the size of the abrasive grits and rotational speed, whereas it tends to decrease with increasing the applied normal load. A 20-70% decrease in the wear rate at higher load was evident for all orientations tested under sliding wear conditions. SEM morphologies of the worn surfaces and abrasive papers revealed that the changes in the abrasiveness counterface conditions after few runs, due to clogging of the depression and/or film transfer of polymer, highly determine the m-2BA wear behaviour. Furthermore, during tests, abrasive grains in the SiC paper were remained rigidly attached to the paper. Accordingly, no changes in the wear mechanism due to fracture, pull out, or attrition of abrasive grains was observed and only two-body abrasion process was dominated. AP-orientation exhibited the lowest wear rate (best abrasive performance) compared to P- and N-orientation. Fibers in AP-orientation enhanced by filling the fiber-matrix gabs with fine debris and this in turn increases the rigidity of the CSM against the side forces leading to less fiber damage. Wear mechanisms were categorized after microscopic observation of the abraded surfaces into five main types, i.e. micro-cutting, micro-ploughing, micro-fracture and micro-cracking in the resin, and micro-fatigue. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that moisture-induced tensile stress on the fiber is substantial when absorbed moisture level in the polymer matrix is high. It is also shown that the stress-state of the fiber is not significantly changed by inclusion of an interphase layer with properties similar to the matrix. The consequence of moisture-induced internal stress is that glass fibers are subjected to stress corrosion, even under no externally applied stress. It is found, by measuring the size of the fracture mirrors of failed glass fibers in model composites, that the in situ tensile strength of E-glass fibers in an epoxy matrix composite was degraded at a faster rate compared to the case of stress-free aging of glass fibers. Thus it is concluded that moisture-induced tensile stress in glass fibers plays an important role in strength degradation of unidirectional composite under environmental aging. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the thermal degradation of the composite occurs in two steps: the first between 130 and 200 C and the second between 250 and 440 C. The characterization of the resin and the composite, after heating, revealed that at moderate temperatures (lower than 100 C) an improvement of the properties of materials is observed. For high temperatures but lower than the temperature of decomposition (Td), the mechanical strength of the resin does seem to be very affected, even improved for certain cases. For these temperatures, the composite presents some fractures of the fiber-matrix interfaces, which causes losses in strength and ductility. When the temperature reaches the temperature of decomposition (Td), a fall of the mechanical properties was recorded for both resin and composite. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this work, a two-step homogenization procedure is applied and compared with experimental values obtained on a polyarylamide/glass fiber composite for a broad range of temperatures. It is observed that the stiffness averaging version of the model surpasses the compliance averaging variant, especially when it is combined with a precise evaluation of the fourth-order orientation tensor. It is also demonstrated that the orthotropic closure approximations are significantly better than previous ones (linear, quadratic, and hybrid) and than a very recent one. Among the orthotropic closure approximations, the fitted ones lead to acceptable results, which are very close to those obtained with the experimentally measured fourth-order orientation tensor. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "The interest in natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites is growing rapidly due to its high performance in terms of mechanical properties, significant processing advantages, excellent chemical resistance, low cost, and low density. The development of composite materials based on the reinforcement of two or more fiber types in a single matrix, which leads to the production of hybrid composites. In the field of technical utilization of plant fibers, banana fiber-reinforced composites represent one of the most important areas. The influence of fiber content, fiber loading, and hybrid effect on the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, Young&#039;s modulus, elongation at break, and flexural properties of the composites, was evaluated. The volume fraction of glass fiber based on total fiber content increases all the mechanical properties, except elongation at break. The tensile and flexural properties of composites are observed to have improved as the fiber loading (vol%) increases. On the other hand, lack of good interfacial adhesion and poor resistance to moisture absorption make the use of natural fiber-reinforced composites less attractive. Modification of the banana fiber improves the optimum fiber-matrix properties. Hybrid effect was calculated using additive rule of hybrid mixtures. The comparison of theoretical and experimental values of tensile properties was determined using a number of models. All the models except parallel show good agreement with the experimental results.",

The experimental results indicate that the 3D laminates consistently had greater damage tolerance than the 2D laminates and the 3D monolithic composites.

The diversified application of FRP composite has taken centre of attraction for interdisciplinary research. However, improvements on mechanical properties of this class of materials are still under research for different applications. In this paper we have modified the epoxy matrix by Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2 micro particles in glass fiber/epoxy composite to improve the mechanical properties. The composites are fabricated by hand lay-up method. It is observed that mechanical properties like flexural strength, flexural modulus and ILSS are more in case of SiO2 modified epoxy composite compare to other micro modifiers. This may be because of smaller particle size of silica compare to others. Alumina modified epoxy composite increases the hardness and impact energy compare to other modifiers. Agglomeration of Al2O3 micro particles in the matrix is observed in SEM. This may be because of bigger particle size of Alumina. SEM analysis clearly indicates the mode of failure is the combination of crack in matrix, matrix/fiber debonding and fiber pull out for all types of composites.",

Water absorption tests were performed by immersing composite specimens into three different water conditions, namely: distilled water, sea water, and acidic water, which were at room temperature, for a period of 3 weeks. The characteristic parameter of diffusion coefficient (D) and maximum moisture content (M m) were determined from the obtained water absorption curves. The water absorption behavior of the glass/jute fiber-reinforced unsaturated polyester hybrid composite was found to follow a non-Fickian behavior. The effects of the various aqueous environments on the flexural and compression characteristics were investigated in this study. The flexural and compression properties were found to decrease with an increasing percentage of water uptakes.",

A higher strain rate sensitive modulus was found in the through-thickness direction while a higher strain rate sensitive failure strength was found in the in-plane direction. In the in-plane direction, the failure mode was observed to change from splitting followed by &quot;kink banding&quot; (localized fiber buckling) to predominantly splitting at increasing strain rates, while it remained the same in the through-thickness direction. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The first section concerns the development history and characteristics of the SiC fiber Nicalon, while the second deals with Nicalon-fiber-reinforced PMC, MMC and CMC. There are four grades of Nicalon fiber, namely the ceramic, HVR (high volume resistivity), LVR (low volume resistivity) and carbon-coated Nicalon fiber. The ceramic grade of Nicalon fiber has been investigated in relation to the tensile strength of the fiber after exposure at 800-1400??C in air. HVR or LVR fiber/epoxy resin composites have low and high dielectric constants, respectively. Nicalon/Al composite wire as an MMC is investigated with respect to tensile strength at high temperatures. The flexural strength, etc., of Nicalon/SiC composite, called Nicaloceram???, as a CMC is reported. A Nicalon/borosilicate glass composite used the carbon-coated Nicalon fiber having various thicknesses of the carbon layer, and the effect of the carbon layer thickness on the flexural strength of this composite has been investigated. The third section describes a low-oxygen-content SiC fiber referred to as Hi-Nicalon??? for ultra-high temperature use. This SiC fiber with excellent thermal stability has been developed by reducing the oxygen content. Polycarbosilane fiber is cured by electron beam irradiation under a He stream and pyrolyzed in an inert atmosphere. This SiC fiber, Hi-Nicalon, has a continuous, multi-filament form and consists of 0??5 wt% oxygen. It has high tensile strength and tensile modulus of 2??8 and 270 Gpa, respectively. Hi-Nicalon has good tensile properties at high temperature. The properties of SiC composites reinforced with Hi-Nicalon have also been investigated. ?? 1994.",

This work focuses on numerical calculation of a fiber orientation tensor of an injection molded short glass fiber polystyrene ( SGF- PS) composite part, shaped as a rectangular plate. In this study, the effects of some parameters of the injection molding process including injection flow rate, mold wall temprature, packing pressure and also fiber content on the changes of fiber orientations of this specimen are investigated. Our studies are concentrated on determining the changes of the first orientation tensor component in the flow direction due to different injection parameters. In addition, the changes on tensile modulus of the injected part are simulated in every condition. The simulations show how these molding parameters can influence both fiber orientation and tensile modulus of injection molded parts. At the first step, in order to be confident about the software results, they are validated by experimental data in two cases.",

Secondary bonded woven E-glass/vinyl ester composite doubler plate joints were subjected to fatigue tension loading to induce stable crack propagation. A finite element (FE) model was developed to correlate experimental strain measurements prior to cyclic loading with the numerical predictions and to determine the sensitivity of the sensors to changes in longitudinal strain due to crack growth. Initial quasi-static tension tests demonstrated satisfactory correlation between the strains from the FBG sensors and FE predictions. The changes in longitudinal strain distribution during the fatigue tests were correlated with crack growth. A progressive shift in the strain distribution in the vicinity of the crack was observed. The experimental results demonstrated that a strain-based methodology can be utilized to detect crack propagation in this type of composite joints. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Purpose The objective of this study was to record the fracture strength of endodontically treated teeth restored with glass fiber reinforced or cast gold post and cores cemented with 3 cements. Material and methods Forty-two single-rooted premolars with standardized weakened roots were endodontically treated and allocated to 6 experimental groups (n=7) defined by the 2 factors investigated: post system and cement. Three groups were restored with glass fiber posts and resin-modified glass ionomer cement, dual-polymerizing resin cement, or chemically active autopolymerizing resin cement. The other 3 groups were restored with cast gold post and cores and the same 3 cements. The cores of the glass fiber post groups were fabricated with composite resin core material. Metal crowns were cemented on the cores in the 6 groups. The entire system was subjected to continuous compression in a universal testing machine, and fracture limit and location (cervical third, middle third, or apical third) were noted. Two-way ANOVA and the Scheff?? test were used to analyze the data and compare the groups (??=.05). Results Two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in the post type (P&lt;.001) and the cements (P&lt;.001). The interaction between them (P&lt;.001) was statistically significant in the fracture resistance of the endodontically treated teeth. The greatest interaction between post and cement was the glass fiber post with resin-modified glass ionomer cement, followed by the cast gold post and core with resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Conclusions The use of a glass fiber reinforced post and resin-modified glass ionomer cement increased the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. ?? 2013 The Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

The size of EPDM phase in the photo-irradiated composites reduces obviously whereas the droplet number increases; (iii) photo-irradiation improves the interface adhesion between SGF and polymer matrix; (iv) the melting and crystallization temperatures of the photo-irradiated composites are not affected greatly by increasing the SGF content; (v) the thermal analysis results show that the incorporation of SGF into PP/EPDM plays an important role for increasing its thermal stability. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The main disadvantage of the composite is its poor mechanical resistance to impact. To improve this property, the fibers were coated with a new type of sizing. The equired characteristics for this sizing is to create strong interactions between the PPS matrix and the glass fiber surface. The ability of the sizings to improve the glass/PPS adhesion has been assessed by the microbond technique. An inconvenience of this technique is the difficulty in defining a parameter that is characteristic of the interfacial adhesion. The objective of this publication is to demonstrate that a plastic flow of the PPS matrix around the fiber leads to a uniform shear strength. The adhesion between these two materials can therefore be obtained by the mean interfacial shear strength.",

Fiber reinforced thermoplastics such as glass/polypropylene (glass/PP) have found their applications in front-end bumper beams, under body shields, and other automotive applications. These materials also have potential usage in mass transit vehicles, such as buses. The present study focuses on the design and manufacture of a segment of the floor of a mass transit bus using glass/PP woven tape forms developed through a hot-melt impregnation process. An initial study on the existing mass transit buses found that a metal skeletal frame and plywood panels are used in the construction of the floor structure. The representative thermoplastic composite floor segment featured a glass/PP woven tape material, belt-pressed to form a flat laminate, and adhesively bonded to a vacuum thermoformed ribbed laminate. A combination of analysis software including Pro/Engineer, HyperMesh®, and ANSYS 7.0 were used for the design and analysis. Weight savings up to 40% were realized using glass/PP woven tape thermoplastic composites as compared to the conventional metal/ plywood design.",

The intrinsic properties of the components, morphology of the system and the nature of interface between the phases determine the dynamic mechanical properties of the composite. At lower temperatures (in the glassy region), the E??? values are maximum for the neat polyester whereas at temperatures above Tg, the E??? values are found to be maximum for composites with 40% fiber loading, indicating that the incorporation of banana fiber in polyester matrix induces reinforcing effects appreciably at higher temperatures. The loss modulus and damping peaks were found to be lowered by the incorporation of fiber. The height of the damping peaks depended on the fiber content. When higher .ber content of 40% was used, an additional peak in the tan ?? curve, pointing to micro mechanical transitions due to the immobilized polymer layer was evident. The glass transition temperature associated with the damping peak was lowered up to a fiber content of 30???. The Tg values were increased with higher fiber content. Cole-Cole analysis was made to understand the phase behavior of the composite samples. A master curve was constructed based on time-temperature super position principle, which allows the prediction of long-term effects. Apparent activation energy of the relaxation process of the composites was also analyzed. The value was found to be maximum for composites with 40% fiber content. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using model systems such as polyethylene glycol and glass fiber mats, as well as an industrially relevant system consisting of poly- propylene and glass fiber mats used in the production ofGMTblanks. It is shown that sig- nificant compression of the fiber mat may occur during impregnation, with subsequent re- laxation on a much longer time-scale. Also, fiber bundle impregnation generally occurs after macro-impregnation is complete, the driving force being the local pressure in the resin around the bundles, dictated by the local state of compression of the mat. The model is then used to provide guidelines for optimization of the preform impregnation conditions for a given material configuration.",

Therefore, the molten resin from benzoxazine and bisoxazoline with the latent curing agent was used as the matrix resin, and the properties of GFRP based on the molten resins were investigated. The proper- ties of GFRP were estimated by mechanical properties, heat resistance, and flame resistance. As a result, it was found that GFRP based on the molten resins from benzoxazine and bisoxazoline with the latent curing agent showed good heat resistance, flame resistance, and mechanical properties compared with those of the conventional GFRP.",

The mechanical properties as a function of reinforcement content show that adding glass fiber to polypropylene/flax composites improves tensile modulus and strength as well as impact resistance and hardness, but has negligible effect on strain at yield and elongation at break. Water uptake at 85C and variations in mechanical behavior are determined after water, thermal, and accelerated UV aging tests. The results indicate that glass fibers enhance water resistance of polypropylene/ flax composites. Thermal aging at 85C reveals that irrespective of filler type and content the composites are thermally resistant. According to accelerated UV aging tests, the presence of glass fiber accelerates the degradation of the polypropylene matrix, but flax fiber can protect the composites. Finally, a partial least-squares model is built to correlate the composite composition to the properties of aged and unaged specimens.",

          "abstract": "In recent years there have been an increasing number of applications of glass in civil engineering structural members, such as roofs, floors, beams and columns. Such interest stems basically from the aesthetical possibilities of glass, in particular its transparency. However, glass presents several limitations, including relatively low tensile strength and brittle behaviour, which contrasts with current design philosophies associated with more conventional materials, such as steel and reinforced concrete. One of the possibilities of overcoming these disadvantages is joining reinforcing materials to glass. The main goal of those transparent composite structural solutions is to increase the post-cracking residual strength and ductility of glass beams. This paper presents results of an experimental study about the flexural behaviour of multi-span composite beams made of annealed glass panes reinforced with GFRP pultruded laminates. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the post-cracking behaviour of such continuous beams, namely the influence of the adhesive used in their construction. The experimental programme included (i) material characterization tests, (ii) tensile tests on double lap joints between glass and GFRP pultruded laminates, bonded with different structural adhesives, and (iii) full-scale flexural tests on multi-span glass-GFRP composite beams, with interfaces bonded also with different adhesives. Results showed that multi-span glass-GFRP composite beams are able to exhibit significant post-cracking residual strength and ductility, stemming not only from their cross-sectional redundancy but also from their capacity to redistribute internal forces. The ultimate load and the post-cracking performance of the multi-span composite beams are significantly affected by the type of the adhesive used to bond GFRP to glass. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

At the beginning, conventional machining techniques were adopted to machine glass fiber-reinforced composites for convenience as well as to keep the capital costs down. This was followed by significant advancements in tool materials and tooling design. With the development of new and more challenging metal-matrix and ceramic-matrix composites, conventional manufacturing processes proved to be inadequate or even inappropriate to process them. Need and opportunity, therefore, exists for alternate nontraditional machining operations, such as laser machining, water jet (WJ) and abrasive water jet (AWJ) cutting, electrical discharge machining, ultrasonic-assisted machining, and electrochemical spark machining.

Methods: Linear polymethyl methacrylate and dimethacrylate monomer preimpregnated unidirectional glass fiber reinforcement was used as an adhesion substrate for low-viscosity diacrylate veneering composite resin and restorative composite resin. A total of 60 test specimens were divided into three groups according to the brand and the use of an intermediate monomer resin (IMR). The used IMRs were either BisGMA-HEMA-resin, BisGMA-TEGDMA resin or the controls were left without the IMR treatment. Dry- and water-stored FRC-substrates were used for adhering the VCR with or without the IMR. The shear bond strength of the VCR to the substrate was measured for dry and thermocycled specimens and the results were analyzed with multi-variate ANOVA. Results: The highest mean shear bond strength (23.9±4.8MPa) was achieved with FRC/BisGMA-HEMA/VCR combination when the FRC substrate was water stored and the test specimen was thermocycled. FRC/BisGMA-TEGDMA/VCR combination resulted in 15.7±6.0MPa with the water-stored FRC substrate and after thermocycling of the test specimens. The lowest shear bond strength (1.0±0.5MPa) was obtained with FRC/VCR combination with water-stored substrate and after thermocycling of the test specimens. Significant differences were found between the mean values of three groups according to the use of IMR (p&lt;0.001). The storage conditions of the FRC substrate were related to brand of the IMR or the composite (p&lt;0.001). High mean values of the shear bond strength after thermocycling fatigue were related to the type of IMR (p&lt;0.001). Significance: The results suggest that the IMRs used in this study greatly influence the mean shear bond strength values when the test specimens are thermocycled. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The first part of this study aimed at selecting a candidate FRC system from different fiber (including glass and basalt) and inorganic matrix combinations on the basis of: constructability, by verifying the workability and ease of installation on concrete cylinders; structural performance, by evaluating strength and deformability enhancement in confined concrete cylinders tested under uniaxial compression; and compatibility, by examining the quality of the concrete-FRC interface and the level of fiber impregnation using scanning electron microscope images. In the second part of this study, the selected FRC system was further assessed through compression tests of additional concrete cylinders confined using different FRC reinforcement ratios, where both axial and in-plane (radial) deformations were measured to assess confinement effectiveness. The feasibility of making the application reversible was investigated by introducing a bond breaker between the concrete substrate and the composite jacket in a series of confined cylinders. The prototype FRC system produced a substantial increase in strength and deformability with respect to unconfined cylinders. A superior deformability was attained without the use of a bond breaker. The predominant failure mode was loss of compatibility due to fiber-matrix separation, which points to the need of improving fiber impregnation to enable a more efficient use of the constituent materials. Semi-empirical linear and nonlinear models for compressive strength and deformation in FRC-confined concrete are also presented. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Damage analyses by X-ray micro-computed tomography (??CT) technique on interrupted fatigue tests at several percentages of total fatigue life were performed to further understand the damage mechanisms and evolution during fatigue loading. It can be observed that experimental results related to the evolution of dynamic modulus, strain, temperature and energy dissipation are important and consistently complement each other for damage evaluation of PA66/GF30. During fatigue loading, diffuse damage occurs over the entire specimen though the damage does not necessarily exhibit the same level between different locations inside the specimen. The ??CT analysis of voids characteristics demonstrates that the damage continuously increases during fatigue loading.

The objective of this work is to identify the main micro-mechanisms which govern the fatigue behavior of a short glass fiber reinforced polyamide composite through a multi-scale experimental analysis. Tension-tension fatigue tests have been performed at different applied maximum stress and have been analyzed at both microscopic and macroscopic scale. Together with the progressive loss of stiffness, the temperature rise during cyclic loading has been measured using an infrared camera. Moreover, SEM observations have been performed on the fracture surfaces. The analysis of the results shows that the fatigue strength is a consequence of two principal mechanisms: matrix temperature rise and fiber-matrix interface damage. Micro-ductile areas have been observed around the fibers. A statistical quantitative analysis relates the size of these very deformed areas to the maximum applied stress. Moreover, it has been shown that damage can appear only after a stabilization of the temperature. Finally, the multi-scale analysis allows relating the stress threshold for each mechanism to the S-N curves. The effects of the frequency and of the mean stress have been also evaluated. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

With the completion of the &#039;proof-of-principle&#039; phase in development of &#039;nuclear-grade&#039; SiC/SiC composites, the R&amp;D on SiC/SiC composites is shifting toward the more pragmatic phase, i.e., industrialization of component manufactures and data-basing. In this paper, recent advances and issues in (1) development of component fabrication technology including joining and functional coating, e.g., a tungsten overcoat as a plasma facing barrier, (2) recent updates in characterization of non-irradiated properties, e.g., strength anisotropy and chemical compatibility with solid lithium-based ceramics and lead-lithium liquid metal breeders, and (3) irradiation effects are specifically reviewed. Importantly high-temperature neutron irradiation effects on microstructural evolution, thermal and electrical conductivities and mechanical properties including the fiber/matrix interfacial strength are specified under various irradiation conditions, indicating seemingly very minor influence on the composite performance in the design temperature range. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.",

Some empty and foam-filled tubes were compressed laterally between two rigid plates. The effects of polyurethane foam-filler on the crushing characteristics and the corresponding energy absorption by the composite tubes are investigated. Composite tubes with three different fiber fabric layers were considered to study the influence of polyurethane foam on the crushing performance. Also, effects of different geometrical characteristics on energy absorption by different tubes are studied. Experimental results show that the presence of polyurethane foam inside the composite tubes suppresses the circumferential delimitation process and fiber fracturing; consequently, it increases the specific absorbed energy by the composite tubes during the flattening process. Also, it is resulted that injection of the polyurethane foam in the tubes causes the more regular deformation mode, comparing with the empty tubes. Finally, experimental results of the present work are compared with some of the previous articles that were investigated the foam-filled composite structures under the different loadings to suggest an optimized energy absorber. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Prototypes of tooth-colored fiber-reinforced abutments were investigated to avoid the shining-through effect. In vitro, the fracture strength was determined after thermal cycling and mechanical loading of all-ceramic single crowns and four-unit bridges made of a fiber-reinforced composite. The suprastructures were adhesively fixed onto fiber-reinforced implant abutments and compared with those fixed on standard titanium abutments. The median of the fracture strength of the titanium-supported all-ceramic crowns was significantly higher than the median of crowns fixed onto the prototypes. But this value was still more than twice as high as the maximum loading force under oral conditions. No statistical difference was found between four-unit bridges made by fiber-reinforced composite inserted onto titanium abutments and those inserted onto fiber-reinforced abutments. Fiber-reinforced abutment prototypes for dental implants avoided the shining-through effect associated with metal abutments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine glass-fiber-reinforced composite IFPDs were made to replace 1 missing maxillary or mandibular tooth. Nineteen IFPDs were randomly assigned to group A and luted with a 2-step bonding system (Excite DSC), while the other 20 IFPDs of group B were cemented with a 3-step adhesive (Syntac). Events such as partial or total debonding of the IFPDs, fracture of the framework, or veneer and fiber exposures were considered failures. Color match, marginal discoloration, secondary caries, marginal adaptation, postoperative sensitivity, and surface texture were evaluated according to the United States Public Health Service modified criteria. RESULTS: Two debondings and 2 fiber exposures occurred during the observation period. All failures occurred in group A. Some fatigue microcracks in the pontic area of the 2 detached IFPDs were observed under scanning electron microscopy. The postoperative sensitivity of group A was much higher than that of group B, and the abutments luted with Excite DCS showed postoperative sensitivity during the first month in 42.2% of cases. The sensitivity disappeared completely after 6 months. Statistical analysis indicated significant differences in postoperative sensitivity (P &lt; .05) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The IFPDs bonded with a 3-step adhesive demonstrated good clinical service in the short observation period. The microfractures of the layering material observed on the debonded IFPDs may suggest excessive flexibility of the fiber structures, which occurs if the framework is fabricated without observing the recommended dimensions.",

In this work, glass and ramie fibers cut to 45mm in length were used to produce hybrid polymer composites by resin transfer molding (RTM), aiming to evaluate their physical, mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties as a function of the relative glass–ramie volume fractions and the overall fiber content (10, 21 and 31vol.%). Higher fiber content and higher ramie fiber fraction in the hybrid composites yielded lower weight composites, but higher water absorption in the composite. The mechanical properties (impact and interlaminar shear strength) of the composites were improved by using higher fiber content, and the composite with 31vol.% of reinforcement yielded the lowest value for the reinforcement effectiveness coefficient C, as expected. Although the mechanical properties were improved for higher fiber content, the glass transition temperature did not vary significantly. Additionally, as found by analyzing the adhesion factor A, improved adhesion tended to occur for the composites with lower fiber content (10%) and higher ramie fiber fraction (0:100) and the results for the adhesion factor A did not correspond to those found by the analysis of the tan delta peak height.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic Emission (AE) can be used to discriminate the different types of damage occurring in a constrained composite. However, the main problem associated with data analysis is the discrimination between the different acoustic emission sources. The objective of the cluster analysis is to separate a set of data into several classes that reflect the internal structure of the data. Indeed, cluster analysis is an important tool for investigating and interpreting data. In this paper we use two kinds of classifiers: a supervised classifier and also an unsupervised one (Kohonen&#039;s map). We combine two techniques: the k-means algorithm and the k nearest neighbours. Glass/polyester model specimens were used for the validation of the proposed methodology. We worked on polyester resin and glass/polyester unidirectional specimens, subjected to tensile loading within different configurations, awaiting preferential damage modes in the material. Moreover, single fibre composites have been tested to produce fibre breakage acoustic emission events under conditions closely approximating those encountered in a real composite. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and the osteoconductive capacity of bioactive fiber-reinforced composite implant (FRC) in vivo.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Threaded sand-blasted FRC implants and threaded FRC implants with bioactive glass (BAG) were fabricated for the study. Titanium implants were used as a reference. Eighteen implants (diameter 4.1 mm, length 10 mm) were implanted in the tibia of six pigs using the press-fit technique. The animals were sacrificed after 4 and 12 weeks. Histomorphometric and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analyses were performed to characterize BIC.\n\nRESULTS: In general, the highest values of BIC were measured in FRC-BAG implants, followed by FRC and Ti implants. At 4 weeks, the BIC was 33% for threaded FRC-BAG, 27% for FRC and 19% for Ti. At 12 weeks, BIC was 47% for threaded FRC-BAG, 40% for FRC and 42% for Ti. Four weeks after implantation, all the implants appeared biologically fixed by a newly formed woven bone arranged in the thin bone trabeculae filling the gap between the implant and the bone of the recipient site. Twelve weeks after implantation, the thickness of the woven bone trabeculae had increased, especially around the FRC-BAG implants.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the FRC implant is biocompatible in bone. The biological behavior of FRC was comparable to that of Ti after 4 and 12 weeks of implantation. Furthermore, the addition of BAG to the FRC implant increased peri-implant osteogenesis and bone maturation.",

The test specimens (3??5??50 mm3, n=6) were made of autopolymerized polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The following fiber reinforcements, referred to as partial fiber reinforcements, were embedded into the denture base resin: ribbon polyethylene fibers, unidirectional dimethacrylate-impregnated glass fibers, dimethacrylate-PMMA-impregnated glass fibers and PMMA-preimpregnated glass fibers. Number of cycles to failure was measured in water by the constant deflection fatigue test with a maximum of 100,000 cycles of the test specimens with partial fiber reinforcement placed at various locations, namely, on the compression or tension side. Magnitude of deflection was 1 mm and loading frequency 2.0 Hz. The number of loading cycles needed to cause a fracture in the test specimen was considered the fatigue failure of the specimen. The results of this study suggest that the fiber reinforcements that allowed even fiber distribution in the cross-section or were placed on the tensile side reinforced the test specimens of PMMA most effectively. The PMMA-preimpregnated glass-fiber reinforcements resulted in a higher number of loading cycles (maximum 100,000) than polyethylene fiber ribbon (2886 cycles in compression, 23,220 in tension). ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

FRC (fiber-reinforced composite) or &quot;composite&quot; poles have been in use since the mid-1950&#039;s, when they were first installed in Hawaii as a solution to wood pole degradation and steel pole corrosion occurring due to the moist salt air environment. Since those early days, significant advancements have been made in composite pole technology to the point where today composite lighting standards are the norm. With their high strength-to-weight ratio, environmental friendliness, non-conductivity, and longest lifespan on the market, composite utility poles for distribution and transmission applications are steadily gaining in popularity with electric utilities. Filament winding, pultrusion, spincasting, and vacuum infusion are the most common composite pole manufacturing processes being used today. The focus of this paper will be on the filament winding technique and the recent key advances that have been made with this process, including new axial fiber placement technology allowing the fiberglass rovings to be placed longitudinally along the pole for increased strength, and development of high-strength, impact-resistant polyurethane resin. In addition to the technological improvements, an innovative modular design concept allows lightweight composite utility pole modules to be easily transported and assembled to make up various combinations of pole lengths and classes",

The performance of the alumina cutting tools was evaluated by measuring the flank wear and surface roughness of the machined GFRP composite material. An attempt is made to analyse the main wear mechanism of alumina cutting tools while machining GFRP composite material. © 2010 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Kevlar-149 fiber showed a significantly higher tensile strength in the microcomposite than as a single filament. For the hybrid, Kevlar-149 fibers usually broke one by one. A positive hybrid effect for the failure strain but a negative hybrid effect for the strength of the hybrid were observed. Tensile strength of the microcomposites predicted by Monte Carlo simulation agreed with the experimental results reasonably well. The tensile modulus of the hybrid followed the rule of mixture. The fiber/matrix interface properties were investigated by using single fibre pull-out from a microcomposite (SFPOM) test, which showed a significant difference between the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of Kevlar fiber/epoxy in single-fiber type (SFT) and that in the hybrid at a constant fiber volume fraction, which shortened the ineffective length and contributed to the failure strain increase of Kevlar-149 fibers in the hybrid. ?? 1993.",

Has this latest prefabricated glass fiber reinforced post and composite core system increased the fracture resistance of teeth and reduced the incidence of unrestorable root fractures.\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of root fracture and mode of failure of endodontically treated teeth restored with two different post and core systems.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty maxillary central incisors were randomly divided into two groups. (n=20). All teeth received endodontic treatment. First group was restored with custom cast post and core system. Second group was restored with glass fiber post and composite core system. In Both the groups posts were cemented with adhesive resin cement. Compressive load was applied at an angle of 130 to the long axis of teeth at a cross head speed of 1 mm/min until fracture occurred. Data were analyzed with student &quot;t&quot; test P&lt;.001.\n\nRESULTS: The mean value for fracture resistance was (331.4025) N in Group -I Custom cast Ni-Cr post and core and (237.0625) N in Group -II Glass fiber reinforced post and composite core system. Students &quot;t&quot; test shows the significant difference in fracture resistance of two groups.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that the incidence of root fracture was significantly higher in custom cast Ni-Cr post and core system than glass fiber post and composite core system. A more favourable mode of failure was observed in teeth restored with Group II glass fiber post system.

Current SHM approaches include embedding some type of sensor within the composite or applying a sensor to the outside surface of the structure. These sensors react to strain or other changes in order to detect damage. In this study, a novel, multi-modal, nanomaterial based sensor technology that can provide wide area detection of damage was used. The efforts presented here serve as a feasibility study into the incorporation of carbon nanomaterials into structural composites as sensors. The carbon nanotube (CNT) covered fiber (fuzzy fiber) sensors exhibit similar sensitivity to conventional strain gages and are more easily integrated into composite structures as the sensor itself is a composite. The fuzzy fiber strain gages can be used to sense strain within composite structures and can be readily integrated into the structural laminate to provide sensing over large sections and in previously inaccessible locations. The unique properties of the fuzzy fiber lends itself to application in a wide range of sensing tasks within a structural composite including strain, temperature, degradation, etc. The fuzzy fiber may be tailored so that the same basic sensor can be used for a multitude of sensing applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The composite and nano-composite panels were characterized experimentally for the important issues in the field of aerospace engineering, like medium velocity bullet impact response and vibration damping characteristics. The MWCNTs were responsible for greater characteristics improvement in the hybrid resin due to their high tendency to absorb the impact shock. The panels without MWCNT turn out to be lesser shock absorption capability. Additionally, 0.1% MWCNT hybrid panel shows exceptional damping response by damping the impacted vibration within 9.5 ms. There is also a 175.51% increase in the damping ratio of the panel. The higher percentage MWCNTs show lesser response towards damping of vibration. This may be due to the lengthy entangled structure of MWCNTs in the resin. It is also observed that the impacted damage is higher in the epoxy system panel than the nano-composite panel.© 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 38 restorations were inserted in 19 patients. Of these, 17 were adhesively fixed three-unit inlay FPDs, five were conventionally cemented complete-coverage three-unit FPDs, and 16 were single molar crowns (six adhesively, ten conventionally cemented). The mean observation period was 2.5 +/- 1.0 years. Events like fracture of the framework or veneer, loss of cementation, signs of wear, and outward discoloration were noted and rated according to modified Ryge criteria. RESULTS: During the observation time, neither loss of cementation nor framework fracture were noted. However, six facings (36%) of the inlay FPDs fractured. The number of cases with discoloration or wear increased over time for all types of restorations. The wear culminated in fiber exposure of two molar crowns (24 months) and one inlay FPD (54 months). One of the five complete-coverage FPDs was replaced at the request of the patient (discoloration). The cumulative survival rate after 36 months was estimated to be 82% for molar crowns and 72% for inlay FPDs. CONCLUSION: Fiber-reinforced composite restorations need further improvement of the veneering composites. Because of the increasing wear, discoloration, fractures of the facings, and fiber exposure, fiber-reinforced composites should only be used for provisional restorations.",

Four glass fiber composite plates were manufactured; each one had embedded a different type of produced PVA-CNT fibers. The multi-functional materials were tested in monotonic tensile tests as well as in progressive damage accumulation tests. The electrical resistance readings of the PVA-CNT fibers were correlated with axial strain values, taking into account the induced damage of the composite. It has been demonstrated that increasing the fiber&#039;s pre-stretching ratio, its electrical resistance response increases due to higher degree of the CNTs alignment in the PVA matrix. Higher fiber pre-stretching degree enables the better strain monitoring of the composite due to higher measured electrical resistance change values noticed for the same applied axial strain values. To this end, it enables for the better monitoring of the progressive damage accumulation inside the composite. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Further aim was to evaluate the effect of fiber-reinforced composite resin (FRC) on the failure mode of the restoration. Material and methods: The experimental composite resin (FC) was prepared by mixing 22.5 wt.% of short E-glass fibers (3 mm in length) and 22.5 wt.% of semi-interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) resin with 55 wt.% of silane treated silica fillers. The clinical crowns of 30 human extracted maxillary incisors were sectioned at the cemento-enamel junction. Five groups of direct complete crowns were fabricated (n = 6); Group A: made from particulate filler composite resin (PFC) (Grandio Caps, VOCO, control), Group B: PFC with fiber post (everStick, StickTeck), Group C: made from PFC with everStick fiber post and FRC-substructure, Group D: made from FC, Group E: made from FC with FRC-substructure. The root canals were prepared and posts were cemented with resin cement (ParaCem Universal). All restored teeth were stored in water at room temperature for 24 h before they were statically loaded with speed of 1.0 mm/min until fracture. Data were analyzed using ANOVA (p = 0.05). Failure modes were visually examined. Results: ANOVA revealed that restorations made from experimental fiber composite resin had higher load-bearing capacity (349 N) (p &lt; 0.05) than the control restorations (173 N). No significant difference was found in load-bearing capacity between restorations reinforced with FRC-substructure and those without (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Restorations made from short glass fiber containing composite resin with IPN-polymer matrix showed better load-bearing capacity than those made with either plain PFC or PFC reinforced with fiber post. ?? 2007.",

The aspect ratios of the glass fibers and the clay platelets were determined by electron microscopy techniques. The aspect ratio of each type of filler decreased as filler loading increased. A two particle population model for the tensile modulus was constructed based on the Mori-Tanaka composite theory. The experimental levels of reinforcement appear to be reasonably consistent with model predictions when changes in particle aspect ratios are accounted for. The tensile strength increases and elongation at break decreases as the content of either filler increases according to expected trends.

          "abstract": "Statement of problem Endodontically treated teeth are known to have reduced structural strength. Glass fiber posts may influence fracture resistance and should be evaluated. Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of glass fiber post length on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. Material and methods Forty intact human maxillary canines were selected and divided into 4 groups, the control group consisting of teeth restored with a custom gold cast post and core, with a length of two-thirds of the root. Other groups received prefabricated glass fiber posts in different lengths: group 1/3, removal of one-third of the sealing material (5 mm); group 1/2, removal of one-half of the sealing material (7.5 mm); and group 2/3, removal of two-thirds of the sealing material (10 mm). All the posts were cemented with resin cement, and the specimens with glass fiber posts received a composite resin core. All the specimens were restored with a metal crown and submitted to a compressive load until failure occurred. The results were evaluated by 1-way ANOVA, and the all pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Tukey honestly significantly difference test) (α=.05). Results The ANOVA showed significant differences among the groups (P&lt;.002). The Tukey test showed that the control group presented significantly higher resistance to static load than the other groups (control group, 634.94 N; group 1/3, 200.01 N; group 1/2, 212.17 N; and group 2/3, 236.08 N). Although teeth restored with a cast post and core supported a higher compressive load, all of them fractured in a catastrophic manner. For teeth restored with glass fiber posts, the failure occurred at the junction between the composite resin core and the root. Conclusion The length of glass fiber posts did not influence fracture load, but cast post and cores that extended two-thirds of the root length had significantly greater fracture resistance than glass fiber posts. © 2014 by the Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

Also, highly nonlinear compositions have been developed with nonlinearities ~1000times silica that enables nonlinear wavelength conversion from the near IR to the mid-and long-wave IR.

          "abstract": "Uses of natural fibers as reinforcement in polymers have gained importance in the recent years due to the eco-friendly nature. This paper deals with the mechanical properties of the composites made up of palmyra fiber waste [pfw] and the pfw/glass fiber hybrid composites. Composite plates were prepared with 30%, 38%, 45%, 50%, 58%, 65% and 70% wt of fiber, waste. Tensile, flexural, shear and impact properties were studied. Composites with 58-65-wt% fibers showed marginal improvement in flexural strength. Tensile strength was decreased and there was considerable improvement in shear and impact properties than that of resin. The properties of the natural fiber reinforced composites can be improved by hybridizing with high strength synthetic fibers such as glass. In this study, the palmyra fiber waste was hybridized with glass fiber in the polyester matrix. Samples were prepared by sandwiching the fiber waste between chopped strand glass fiber mats by varying both glass fibers and waste material content, keeping total fiber content as 60% by weight. Specimens were cut as per ASTM standards and tested in Instron universal testing machine. Mechanical properties of the composites were found to be increased with increase in the amount of glass fiber in the hybrid. Hybrid composites containing 48% waste, 10% glass fiber showed good reinforcement effect than the composites reinforced with 11 wt % glass fiber. The resin used was isophthalic roof light resin, the catalyst and accelerator were methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) and cobalt napthanate, respectively.",

          "abstract": "Impact tests with a falling dart and flexural measurements were carried out on polypropylene based laminates reinforced with glass fibers fabrics. Research has shown that the strong fiber/matrix interface obtained through the use of a compatibilizer increased the mechanical performance of such composite systems. The improved adhesion between fibers and matrix weakly affects the flexural modulus but strongly influences the ultimate properties of the investigated woven fabric composites. In fact, bending tests have shown a clear improvement in the flexural strength for the compatibilized systems, in particular when a high viscosity/high crystallinity polypropylene was used. On the contrary, the low velocity impact tests indicated an opposite dependence on the interface strength, and higher energy absorption in not compatibilized composites was detected. This result has been explained in terms of failure mechanisms at the fiber/matrix interface, which are able to dissipate large amounts of energy through friction phenomena. Pull-out of fibers from the polypropylene matrices have been evidenced by the morphological analysis of fracture surfaces after failure and takes place before the fibers breakage, as confirmed by the evaluation of the ductility index. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The tensile strength of uniaxially reinforced all-cellulose composite was 480 MPa at 25 degreesC, and the dynamic storage modulus was as high as 20 GPa at 300 degreesC.

The tolerance of composites to damage induced by cyclic loading and moisture ingress is of utmost importance. This study highlights the effects of short-term cyclic moisture aging on the strength and fatigue performance of a glass/vinyl ester pultruded composite system. In particular, it addresses the change in quasi-static properties and tension-tension (R = 0.1) fatigue behavior of a commercial glass/vinyl ester system in fresh and salt water. The quasi-static tensile strength was seen to reduce by 24% at a moisture concentration of 1% by weight. This reduction in strength was not recoverable even when the material was dried, suggesting that the exposure to moisture caused permanent damage in the material system. Even though the fatigue damage process of the unaged or `as-delivered&#039;, fresh-water- and salt-water-saturated material was similar, the cyclic moisture absorption-desorption experiments altered the fatigue performance of the composite system tested. Results were consistent with Mandell&#039;s postulate that fatigue failure in glass-fiber-reinforced polymeric composites is a fiber-dominated mechanism with a characteristic slope of 10% UTS/decade.",

Three reactive silane coupling agents, with anhydride, epoxy, or amine functionality, were used and found to have little effect on the mechanical properties when no EPR-g-MA is present. When 20 wt% EPR-g-MA is used as a rubber toughener, however, the yield strength and Izod impact strength were lowest for the amine functional silane and highest for the anhydride silane, while the epoxy silane fell in-between. These results were attributed to the differences in reactivity of the three reactive silanes. An unreactive silane (octyl groups) was used as a release agent on the glass fibers and compared with the anhydride functional silane. The octyl silane did not improve the ductility of the composite, as may have been speculated, and had poor yield strength and impact resistance when compared to the anhydride silane. Both octyl and anhydride treated glass fibers improve the heat distortion temperature such that most of the high temperature stiffness that is lost on addition of EPR-g-MA is regained by adding glass fibers. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The tensile, flexural, and impact properties of the tensile bars are compared. It is found that the residence time, fill-up, and the intesity of mixing during extrusion compounding have a predominant effect on fiber length degradation. The screw designs were seen to have a greater effect on the fiber damage in the 40 wt% glass-filled polymer than the 30 wt% glass-filled polymer. However, the mechanical properties of the 30 wt% glass-filled polymer showed an increasing trend compared to the 40 wt% glass filled polymer. A screw design that provides a balance of the fiber length, wet-out, and fiber dispersion was noted to give consistent mechanical properties.",

          "abstract": "This article presents an experimental investigation on developing wood plastic composites reinforced with continuous glass fibers in an extrusion process. The main role of wood component in wood plastic composite is mainly as a filler to reduce cost, and not reinforcing. Adding wood component causes a noticeable reduction in strength and toughness. This will hinder their usage in load-bearing applications. In this study, a novel method for production of hybrid wood plastic composites is introduced. This manufacturing process takes the advantages of a cost-effective and flexible production line. First, E-glass rovings were impregnated with a polymer in an especially designed (impregnating) die. Then, six melt impregnated glass rovings were integrated with wood plastic composites in a single step via an extrusion process. Another unique die was designed and manufactured to feed and position the impregnated glass rovings into a round shaped wood plastic composite profile. Wood content was changed in three levels to investigate its effect on the processability and the final properties of the hybrid composites. The experimentation on the extruded hybrid wood plastic composites proved the feasibility of the process and the relative uniformity of the roving positions in the extrudate. Three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate the flexural properties. Improvements in strength, modulus, and toughness were dramatic.",

          "abstract": "In the present work, the building panel of glass fiber reinforced polyvinylidene chloride composite was prepared and the tensile fracture surfaces of the composites were investigated by the box-counting method of multifractal theory. It suggested that the tensile fracture surface of polyvinylidene chloride/glass fiber (PVDC/GF) composite exhibits multifractal features and the tensile fracture surface morphology of the composite have a strong dependence on the mechanical properties. The results showed that the variation of glass fiber content would lead to the change of mechanical properties, which were responsible for the tensile fracture morphology of PVDC/GF composite. Consequently, the gray value distribution characterizing the surface morphology on the tensile fracture surface would become more non-uniform or less due to this change. The multifractal spectrum could correspondingly mirror this variation according to multifractal methodology. It indicated that the width in multifractal spectrum is sensitive to the morphology of the tensile fractured surface. It is concluded that the multifractal spectrum is the result of the change in mechanical properties of the composites. Additionally, it also suggested that the tensile fracture of the composite is the result of the competition between ductile fracture and brittle fracture by comparing the multifractal spectra and the multifractal spectra would correspondingly change due to this competition. The more the percentage of ductile fracture is, the more rough the fracture surface, the larger the width in the multifractal spectrum. Therefore, it is thought that the multifractal spectrum could feature the rough morphology of the tensile fractured surface and the mechanical properties quantitatively. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, plastic-based substrates coupled with the recent developments in solution deposition and ink-jet printing for laying down OLED materials and active-matrix thin-film-transistor (TFT) arrays open up the possibility of cost-effective processing in high volumes using roll to roll (R2R) processing.(1) To replace glass, however, a plastic substrate needs to be able to offer some or all of the properties of glass, i.e., clarity, dimensional stability, thermal stability, barrier, solvent resistance, and low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) coupled with a smooth surface. In addition, a conductive layer may be required. No plastic film offers all these properties so any plastic-based substrate will almost certainly be a multilayer composite structure.(1,2) This paper will discuss the issues associated with selecting plastic materials, contrast the various options, and highlight how to gain optimum performance through process control. This will be illustrated with examples of film in use in flexible electronic applications.",

Proposed methodologies have either been based on damage modeling or on some kind of mathematical relationship. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were used as an alternative non-linear modeling technique due to their ability to learn by example. Previous research has shown that, if trained adequately, the ANN can be used to predict composites fatigue life for a given set of conditions usually sought by designers. Similar to other reported attempts, the authors&#039; previous work used the classical feedforward ANN for the fatigue life prediction of composites. Although the use of this network model gave results comparable to current fatigue life prediction methods, other types of ANN such as modular, self-organizing, radial basis, and principal component analysis networks are considered for improving the prediction accuracy. A comparison of such ANN structures in predicting the fatigue behavior of unidirectional glass fiber/epoxy composite laminae for various fiber orientation angles and stress ratios is investigated in this work. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of unidirectional fiber orientation and load direction on the shear bond strength of PFC to FRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unidirectional E-glass FRC was used as an adhesion substrate for the PFC. E-glass FRCs were oriented in three ways--Group A: in the plane perpendicular to the bonding surface; Group B: along the bonding surface longitudinal to the load; and Group C: along the bonding surface, transverse to the load. The FRC substrates were ground flat with 1200 grit. The PFC adherend was bonded to FRC using an intermediate resin. Twelve specimens for each group were water stored (37 degrees C) for 3 days before a shear bond strength test was conducted. RESULTS: A one-way analysis of variance showed that the direction of the applied load to the fiber direction had a significant effect on the bond strength values (p &lt; 0.001). A Weibull analysis produced values (characteristic strength and Weibull modulus) of Group A (46.5 MPa, 12.1), Group B (40.6 MPa, 4.6), and Group C (27.6 MPa, 3.5). SIGNIFICANCE: The highest shear bond strength values and Weibull modulus were obtained when the fibers were oriented perpendicular to the bonding surface, exposing the fiber ends to the PFC. Interface strategies between hybrid composite layers may be developed to exploit anisotropic behavior in the adherence between FRC and PFC.",

The effect of fiber size and surface structure on the fiber/PVA interfacial adhesion, and consequently on the macroscopic properties such as optical, tensile, and dynamical mechanical properties of composite films were studied. The fractured surface morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy. It showed that interfacial debonding happened to CANM/PVA composites, whereas good interfacial adhesion was formed for CNM/PVA composites. The visible light transmittance and the mechanical properties of PVA composite films were evaluated. CNM/PVA showed higher optical transparency than CANM/PVA composite films. Additionally, the light transmittance of CNM/PVA was insensitive to temperature. Dynamical mechanical analysis demonstrated that the storage moduli of electrospun fiber/PVA composite films were obviously improved in the glass-rubber transition and rubbery zone, but more significantly in the melting zone. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the disruptive nature of recycling methods on such structures, these materials nevertheless can be recycled. In this report, the recyclability of a fiber-reinforced cyclic BPA polycarbonate has been studied. It is found that ground up composite is recyclable and possesses properties as good as or better than a comparable commercial composite. The processing techniques investigated herein are injection, extrusion compression, and compression molding. As expected, processing technique and parameters are important in determining the mechanical properties of the molded regrind. Our results show that injection and extrusion compression molding yield recycled composites with good tensile properties, though the impact strengths are relatively low. This is due to high fiber orientation and fiber bundle dispersion. On the other hand, compression molded samples, which show random fiber orientation and low fiber bundles dispersion have relatively low tensile properties, but excellent impact strength. Results are discussed in terms of microstructural details, which include resin molecular weight and fiber length and orientation.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the results of a series of blast tests on a carbon fiber-reinforced poly-ether-imide (PEI) and a glass fiber-reinforced PEI composite. Initially, the fracture properties of the two composite systems were characterized through a series of flexural and interlaminar fracture tests. Blast testing was then undertaken on a ballistic pendulum facility, capable of measuring the impulse imparted by the plastic explosive. Delamination, localized fiber buckling, fiber fracture, and shear failure at the boundary of the clamped plates were identified as the primary failure mechanisms in the laminates, with their severity depending on the panel thickness and the applied impulse. Delamination was very localized along the center plane of the laminate, a reflection of the very high interlaminar fracture toughness of these composites. The critical impulse for rear surface fiber fracture has been found to increase rapidly with laminate thickness for the range of panels considered here. The impulses associated with the onset of rear-surface fiber fracture and complete failure of the target were similar, suggesting that rear surface fiber fracture is a pre-cursor to complete failure in these laminates. Limited tests on the glass fiber-reinforced PEI system showed that it offers a superior blast resistance to its carbon fiber counterpart. © SAGE Publications 2008.",

GFRCRs have been developed for dental applications during the past several years. This preliminary clinical study described the treatment of patients whose missing primary molars were restored with everStick, a semimanufactured product made of glass fibers, thermoplastic polymer, and lightcuring resin matrix for reinforcing dental polymer. METHODS: everStick was applied as a space maintainer when there was a loss of 1 or 2 teeth in the maxillary or mandibular arch. RESULTS: This study showed that the GFRCR space maintainers functioned well during a short period. The clinical advantages of the GFRCR space maintainers were that they: provided cost and time savings; did not require a cast model; did not require a second visit; were easy to apply; provided reliable adhesive bonding; provided long-term retention; were used when there was an indication of metal allergy; were easy to clean; had a natural feel and were esthetic. CONCLUSIONS: GFRCR space maintainers can be a new alternative to the conventional space maintainers used in pediatric dentistry.",

The building block of this innovative beam is a novel composite sandwich structure made up of glass fiber composite skins and modified phenolic core material that has been specifically developed for civil engineering applications. The sandwich beam is produced by gluing layers of fiber composite sandwich structure together in flatwise (horizontal) and in edgewise (vertical) orientations. The glued sandwich beams with edgewise laminations presented appropriate strength and stiffness for replacement turnout timber sleeper. The mechanical properties of these glue-laminated sand- wich beams are comparable with the existing timber turnout sleepers, demonstrating that the innovative composite sandwich beam is a viable alternative sleeper material for railway turnouts. From this study, it is concluded that the glue-laminated composite sandwich structures have the potential to be used for replacement railway turnout sleepers. An enhanced understanding of the behavior of fiber composite sandwich structures for potential civil engineering applications is also an outcome of this investigation",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to measure the flexural strength and the elastic modulus of composite resin with and without reinforcing fibers and to evaluate the reinforcing effect of various fibers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A polyethylene fiber (Ribbond), a polyaramid fiber (Fibreflex), and three glass fibers (FibreKor, GlasSpan, Vectris) were used to reinforce composite resins. The flexural strength and elastic modulus of specimens in the three-point bending mode were measured using a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min after storage in water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. All tests were carried out in a water bath at 37 degrees C. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance and the Sheffé test at P= 0.05. After testing, the fractured surface was evaluated using a scanning electron microscope at 50x, 500x, and 3,000x magnifications. RESULTS: Yield flexural strengths of nonreinforced resins were 48 to 56 MPa, and those of reinforced resins were 56 to 134 MPa. Ultimate flexural strengths of nonreinforced specimens were 96 to 119 MPa, and those of reinforced ones were 203 to 386 MPa. Elastic modulus of nonreinforced resin was 6 to 9 GPa, and fiber reinforcing increased the value to 9 to 15 GPa, while it had no effect in Ribbond. CONCLUSION: Most of the fibers used in this study increased both yield and ultimate flexural strengths of composite resins, with the exception of the yield strength of Vectris. GlasSpan, Fibreflex, and FibreKor were effective in reinforcing elastic modulus, while Ribbond had no effect on it. Unidirectional glass fibers and polyaramid fiber were effective in reinforcing both flexural strength and elastic modulus of composite resin.",

The X-ray crystal structures of three SULTs have been solved and combined with mutagenesis experiments and molecular modelling, they have provided the first clues as to the factors that govern the unique substrate specificities of some of these enzymes. In the future these and other studies will facilitate prediction of the fate of chemicals metabolised by sulfation. Variation in sulfation capacity may be important in determining an individual&#039;s response to xenobiotics, and there has been an explosion in information on sulfotransferase polymorphisms and their functional consequences, including the influence of SULT1A1 genotype on susceptibility to colorectal and breast cancer. Finally, the first gene knockout experiments with SULTs have recently been described, with the generation of estrogen sulfotransferase deficient mice in which reproductive capacity is compromised. Our improved understanding of these enzymes will have significant benefits in such diverse areas as drug design and development, cancer susceptibility, reproduction and development.",

          "abstract": "Halogen free nitrogen-phosphorous flame retardants (PMOP) were prepared through reaction of melamine and polyphosphoric acid in the presence of flame retardant modifier CM with silicotungistic acid as a catalyst in aqueous solution. FT-IR, XRD, DSC and TGA techniques were used to characterize the reaction product PMOP. The obtained flame retardants were then used to prepare flame retardant (FR) polyamide 6 (PA6) composite reinforced with glass fiber (GF) and the factors affecting the flame retardancy of the material were also investigated. The FR GF reinforced PA6 composite and the obtained charred layers were analyzed by utilizing TGA, SEM, FT-IR and XRD. The properties of the charred layer were connected with the flame retardancy of the corresponding material to reveal the flame retarding mechanism of FR GF reinforced PA6 composite. The experimental results show that PMOP flame retardant consists of melamine polyphosphate, melamine phosphate and possible melamine pyrophosphate. The presence of CM was found to improve the flame retardancy of FR GF reinforced PA6 composite. It was experimentally found that PMOP flame retardant, which is comparatively stable in the range of processing temperatures of PA6, is particularly suitable for flame retarding PA6 reinforced with GF. With increasing the flame retardant content, the flame retardancy of the FR reinforced material is not improved so obviously. However, the increase in the GF content greatly improves the flame retardancy of the composite, because GF greatly increases the char yield of material, decreases the maximal thermal decomposition rate, promotes the formation of charred layer with (PNO)x structure and greatly increases the strength of the charred layer. The prepared FR GF reinforced PA6 composites have good comprehensive properties with flame retardancy 1.6 mm UL 94 V-0 level, tensile strength 76.8 MPa, Young&#039;s modulus 11.7 GPa, Izod notched impact strength 4.5 kJ/m2, flexural strength 98.0 MPa and flexural modulus 7.2 GPa, showing a better application prospect. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, six mold temperatures (25, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120°C), two initial resin temperatures (15 and 28°C), and vacuum (0.03 bar) and without vacuum (~1 bar) conditions are utilized. Specimens are characterized by ultrasonic C-scan inspection, mechanical tests (tensile, flexural, and impact), thermal analyses (ignition loss and TGA) and scanning electron microscopy. It is observed that mechanical properties of the specimens produced at a mold temperature of 60°C with the application of vacuum and initial resin temperature of 28°C proved to be the highest (e.g., 16, 26, and 43% higher tensile strength, flexural strength, and Charpy impact toughness, respectively, compared to the lowest values attained with mold temperatures other than 60°C while other variables are kept constant). It has been shown that application of vacuum contributes to the final mechanical properties of the produced composites by lowering the percentage of `voids&#039;. In fact, without the application of vacuum, the deteriorations in mechanical properties are as high as 26% loss in Charpy impact toughness and 5% losses in tensile and flexural strength. Additionally, lowering the initial resin temperature is shown to alter mechanical properties (e.g., 14, 12, and 18% losses in tensile strength, flexural strength, and Charpy impact toughness, respectively, when the initial resin temperature is decreased from 28 to 15°C).",

The suitability of wood flour as a filler for continuous glass mat-reinforced polypropylene has been tested using different mesh sizes (e.g., 20 and 40 mesh), as well as by varying the weight percentage of wood flour from 0%-30%. Moreover, different treatments such as coupling agent A-1100 and functionalized polypropylene grafting with maleic anhydride, and so forth, have also been used to improve the compatibility of wood flour and glass fiber with the polymer resin. In addition, the effects of the surface weight of glass mat and matrix resin have been studied. The extent of the improvement in mechanical properties depends on the wood flour content and size, the surface weight of the glass mat, the matrix resin, and the surface treatment of wood flour. After adding wood flour, the contact angle of distilled water on the composite surface decreases and the polar component of surface tension increases. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

          "abstract": "Thermal conductivity of a polymer composite is a function of resin type, fiber type and architecture, fiber volume fraction, direction of heat flow, and service temperature. Recognizing the thermal responses in Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite decks play a critical role in their performance, accurate thermal measurements of FRP decks are essential. The objective of the research is to attain better understanding of global and local thermal behavior of a composite structural system through fundamental understanding of thermal conductivity properties. The literature reveals that a major focus has been placed on measurements of thermal conductivity in through-the-thickness direction of a FRP composite. Therefore, current research focus has been on characterization of thermal conductivity in the planar direction (along the direction of fiber and transverse direction of fiber) of a composite laminate. The characterization has been carried out using Guarded heat flow meter method in accordance with ASTM E 1530. The results obtained from this study are useful for the prediction of thermal conductivity of E-glass and Carbon fiber composites with vinyl ester. Results showed that E-glass/Vinyl ester samples exhibited in-plane and through-the- thickness thermal conductivity of 0.35 0.05 W/m K. Thermal conductivity of Carbon/Vinyl ester composite is almost twice the conductivity in transverse and four times greater than through-the-thickness direction. Addition of 10 wt%, 12.5 wt% of graphite powder additive in neat vinyl ester resin increased the conductivity by nearly 88%, 170% respectively. The experimental values from this research correlated well with results from rule of mixtures in in- plane direction and also correlated with other theoretical methods. The results of this research would also be useful for in situ non-destructive testing of composite structures using Infrared thermography.",

Three GFRE composites were studied. The only difference between them is in the initial preparation of fibers which is intentionally simplified compared to the complex sizings used in industry. Thus, fibers treated with aminosilane or silicone coupling agents were compared with fibers simply washed with deionized water.The dielectric measurements show the leading role of interfacial bonding in the trapping or diffusion of electric charges. To obtain high mechanical properties, a fiber treatment that contributes to the diffusion of electric charges along the fiber/matrix interface is preferred. In addition, after friction, a modification of the dielectric properties in all materials is observed, and the trapping or the diffusion of the charges along the interfaces can make it possible to lower the friction coefficient, or the wear. © 2011 The Author(s) Reprints and permissions.",

Controls received composite resin cores without fiber posts. The specimens were loaded to failure and fractographically examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: Statistical analysis revealed that specimens with fiber posts demonstrated significantly higher failure loads and favorable fracture pattern compared to the controls. At fractographic analysis, specimens with fiber posts demonstrated delamination of the veneer ceramic from intact zirconia under structure. Meanwhile, the specimens that were restored without a fiber post demonstrated micro-cracking of the composite core build-up resulting in loss of the support under the zirconia crowns which was responsible for the initiation of radial crack and catastrophic damage. Conclusions: Within the limitation of this study, the insertion of fiber post improved the support under zirconia crowns which resulted in higher fracture loads and favorable failure type compared to composite core build-up. ?? 2008.",

The challenges lie in manufacturing evaluation of the newest aerospace structures and materials and the in-service inspection and monitoring of damaged or aging composites. This paper provides examples of several promising NDI applications in the world of aerospace composites. Airborne (or non-contact) Ultrasonic Testing (UT) has been available for decades, but recently has generated new interest due to significant improvements in transducer design and low noise electronics. Boeing is developing inspection techniques for composite joints and core blankets using this technology. In-service inspection techniques for thick, multi-layer structures are also being advanced. One effective technique integrates the S-9 Sondicator, a traditional bond testing device, with Boeing&#039;s Mobile Automated Scanner (MAUS) platform. Composite patches have seen limited use on-aircraft, due, in part, to the difficulty of determining the quality of a bonded joint. A unique approach using Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) is showing promise as a bonded patch-inspection method. Other NDI techniques currently being developed for aerospace application are also briefly discussed",

Wf reinforcement increased compressive strain to failure by over 600% compared to the unreinforced ZrAlNiCuSi bulk metallic glass. The increase in compressive toughness comes from the fibers restricting shear band propagation, promoting the generation of multiple shear bands and additional fracture surface area. The compressive failure mode changed from a single shear band to multiple shear bands and to localized fiber bucking and tilting as Wf volume fraction increasing.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two different types of substrates were investigated: (a) Plain polymer (BisGMA 50%-TEGDMA 50%) and (b) FRC. The average surface roughness (Ra ) was measured using spinning-disk confocal microscope. The phase composition was identified using X-ray diffraction analyzer. The degree of monomer conversion (DC%) was determined using FTIR spectrometry. The blood response, including the blood-clotting ability and platelet adhesion morphology, was evaluated. Fibroblast cell responses were studied in cell culture environment using routine test conditions. RESULTS: The Ra of the substrates investigated was less than 0.1 μm with no signs of surface crystallization. The DC% was 89.1 ± 0.5%. The FRC substrates had a shorter clotting time and higher platelets activation state than plain polymer substrates. The FRC substrates showed higher (P &lt; 0.01-0.001) amount of adhered cells than plain polymer substrates at all time points investigated. The strength of attachment was evaluated using serial trypsinization, the number of cells detached from FRC substrates was 59 ± 5%, whereas those detached from the plane polymer substrates was 70 ± 5%, indicating a stronger (P &lt; 0.01) cell attachment on the FRC surfaces. Fibroblasts grew more efficiently on FRC than on plain polymer substrates, showing significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) cell metabolic activities throughout the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of E-glass fibers enhances blood and fibroblast responses on composite surfaces in vitro.",

The restorations were thermocycled and mechanically stressed, and fracture resistance was determined. Marginal adaptation was evaluated before and after stress application using semiquantitative analysis in a scanning electron microscope.\n\nRESULTS: All-ceramic and fiber-reinforced composite crowns reached the highest fracture resistance after stress application in combination with the resin cement. When luted with resin-modified glass-ionomer or zinc-oxide-eugenol-free cements, the fracture resistance of all-ceramics decreased significantly, while the fiber-reinforced composite crowns maintained their fracture resistance level; the lowest values were found for zinc-oxide-eugenol-free cements. The marginal adaptation remained unchanged after stress for all-ceramics and fiber-reinforced composite restorations if they were luted with resin cements. Luting with resin-modified glass-ionomers significantly deteriorated the marginal adaptation after stress application, with the exception of the crown-cement interface of all-ceramics.\n\nCONCLUSION: The highest fracture resistance and marginal adaptation were found for all-ceramic and glass fiber-reinforced composite molar crowns if they were luted with resin cement.",

The AESO resin reinforced with woven E-glass fiber was tested as a reference and gave a flexural modulus of 17 GPa, while a room temperature curing of the neat resin gave a flexural modulus of about 1.1 GPa.

Due to harsh growth conditions, the CNT-grafted fibers often exhibit degraded tensile properties. In the current study we explore an alternative approach to deliver CNTs to the fiber surface by dispersing CNTs in the fiber sizing formulation. This route takes advantage of the developed techniques for CNT dispersion in resins and introduces no damage to the fibers. We focus on unidirectional glass fiber/epoxy macro-composites where CNTs are introduced in three ways: (1) in the fiber sizing, (2) in the matrix and (3) in the fiber sizing and matrix simultaneously. Interfacial shear strength (IFSS) is investigated using single-fiber push-out microindentation. The results of the test reveal an increase of IFSS in all three cases. The maximum gain (over 90%) is achieved in the composite where CNTs are introduced solely in the fiber sizing. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "Statement of problem. Previous studies on the strength of teeth restored with posts have not resolved the controversy as to which post systems provide the greatest strength and longevity. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to compare the strength of teeth restored using cast posts with those restored using glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts and to evaluate the bond strength of the posts to dentin. Material and methods. The investigation was conducted by using finite element analysis, combined with the application of contact elements. Three-dimensional (3-D) models of the maxillary central incisors were generated: IT, an intact tooth; CC, a tooth with a ceramic crown; FP, a tooth restored with an FRC (glass fiber-reinforced composite resin) post; CPAu, a tooth restored with a gold alloy cast post; and CPNi, a tooth restored with an NiCr (nickel chromium alloy) cast post. Each model was subjected to vertical and oblique loads with a force of 100 N. To evaluate the strength of the restored tooth, ceramics, and composite resin, the modified von Mises failure criterion was used, the Tsai-Wu criterion for FRC, and the von Mises criterion for gold and NiCr alloy. The equivalent stresses found in the tested models were compared with the tensile strength of the respective materials. Contact stresses in the luting cement-dentin interface were calculated. Results. The maximum mvM (modified von Mises failure criterion) stresses in the dentin of the teeth restored with FRC posts were reduced by 21%, and in those restored with cast NiCr posts, stresses were reduced by 25% when compared to the stresses in the intact tooth. The equivalent stresses in metal posts were several times higher than in FRC posts, but did not exceed the tensile strength of the materials. The highest mvM stress in the luting resin cement around the FRC post was 55% higher than in the luting resin cement around the metal post, under an oblique load. In the ceramic crown, which covered the composite resin post and core, the highest mvM stress was 30.7 MPa, whereas with the metal post and core, it was 23 MPa. Conclusions. Cast metal posts resulted in lower stresses in the dentin of the restored teeth than did FRC posts. Irrespective of the material, the equivalent stresses in the posts did not exceed their tensile strength. Lower stresses were present in the luting cement and the cement-dentin interface around cast posts than around FRC posts. In the ceramic crown supported by a metal post and core, the stresses were lower than those observed in the crown supported by a composite resin core foundation. © 2011 The Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

This indicated its excellent oxidation resistance at elevated temperature. No cracks and pores were found in the sintered composite, indicating that the combination of pre-oxidation and spark plasma sintering was better than the pyrolysis for manufacturing dense composites.

The melting enthalpy was decreased with glass fiber loadings, but no significant change was noted in the crystalline peak temperatures ([IMG]f1.gif&quot; ALT=&quot;Formula&quot; BORDER=&quot;0&quot;&gt;).

Incorporation of glass fiber reduced the crystalline enthalpy of compatibilized and uncompatibilized systems. DMA results showed that composite properties were affected by the presence of the compatibilizer at low fiber loading ([≤]14% V f).

Three prefabricated fiber posts with one of two core composite resins each or a post resin were used. Each specimen was subjected to a three-point bending test after cyclic loading (1000 times) by 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 mm deflection. Under cyclic loading, flexure strength and elastic modulus tended to show a decrease with increase in deflection in the unidirectional fiber post specimens. No such tendency, however, was observed in the bidirectional fiber post specimen. In conclusion, use of a prefabricated fiber post in a post-and-core complex improved the flexural properties of the core composite resin, regardless of fiber direction. Although deterioration in flexural properties was observed with cyclic loading in the unidirectional fiber post specimens, no significant difference was observed in the bidirectional fiber post specimen.",

          "abstract": "In many reinforced composite manufacturing processes it is necessary to compact the fiber materials to obtain the desired fiber/resin ratio in the finished part. Detailed knowledge of applied surface force versus material fiber volume is particularly important in processes such as pultrusion, resin transfer molding, and compression molding. The force required to compact a stack of reinforcing material is strongly dependent on the type of fiber used and its material form. Complicated interactions are possible, particularly when mixtures of unidirectional, oriented cloth and random fiber mats are used. This paper will present results of an experimental and analytical investigation of the response of various dry reinforcing materials subjected to compressive forces applied normal to their principle plane. Experiments were conducted by applying up to 8.6 MPa normal force to thick stacks of E-glass, graphite cloth, mat and unidirectional material and combinations of two different fiber orientation. Pressure versus fiber volume data were generated for both individual materials and various combinations. Experimental results were compared to analytical predictions. Data showed that the force versus deformation is very strongly dependent on the details of the fiber form or forms being used. There is structural relaxation during fiber compression. Relaxation is very related to fiber orientation, span length, and fiber breakage during compaction. Relaxation behavior decreases with fiber alignment. Random mats and 0/90 cloth show much more relaxation than unidirectional fibers. Data of relaxation is very well fitted with a Maxwell-Wiechert viscoelastic model.",

          "abstract": "Distributed fiber optic sensing presents unique features that have no match in conventional sensing techniques. The ability to measure temperatures and strain at thousands of points along a single fiber is particularly interesting for the monitoring of elongated structures such as pipelines, flow lines, oil wells, and coiled tubing. Sensing systems based on Brillouin and Raman scattering are used, for example, to detect pipeline leakages, to verify pipeline operational parameters and to prevent failure of pipelines installed in landslide areas, to optimize oil production from wells, and to detect hot spots in high-power cables. Recent developments in distributed fiber sensing technology allow the monitoring of 60 km of pipeline from a single instrument and of up to 300 km with the use of optical amplifiers. New application opportunities have demonstrated that the design and production of sensing cables are a critical element for the success of any distributed sensing instrumentation project. Although some telecommunication cables can be effectively used for sensing ordinary temperatures, monitoring high and low temperatures or distributed strain presents unique challenges that require specific cable designs. This contribution presents advances in long-range distributed sensing and in novel sensing cable designs for distributed temperature and strain sensing. This paper also reports a number of significant field application examples of this technology, including leakage detection on brine and gas pipelines, strain monitoring on gas pipelines and combined strain and temperature monitoring on composite flow lines, and composite coiled tubing pipes",

The glass transition temperature, Tg, of the adhered nylon 66 layer on the glass-fiber surface was directly evaluated on the basis of SVM measurement. In the case of the GF treated with an aminosilane coupling agent and a sizing agent, the magnitude of Tg at the (GF/nylon 66) interfacial layer was higher than that of the matrix nylon 66 due to the effective restriction of thermal molecular motion of nylon 66 at the (GF/nylon 66) interfacial layer.

          "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced polymeric (FRP) composites have been under analytical and experimental investigations for approx. 40 years in the context of aerospace, marine and mechanical applications. Now the use of FRP composites in civil engineering applications is steadily increasing. For civil engineering structures subject to cyclic loading, one important limit state in design is fatigue. Thus, a review of the existing data is necessary to determine the applicability to civil engineering structures. This review will focus on E-glass FRP composites under tension–tension axial fatigue with test frequency of 5 Hz or less, without environmental concerns. Test and material parameters, which define the data, are identified as R ratio, test frequency, load control, specimen shape, type of reinforcement and resin. A fatigue life diagram summarizing the E-glass FRP composite tension–tension axial fatigue data is plotted for normalized stress (maximum fatigue stress divided by ultimate tensile strength) vs. log of fatigue life. This plot reveals a lower bound confidence level, regardless of test parameter combination, such as reinforcement, resin, or R ratio. This lower bound confidence level was challenged via laboratory testing of an E-glass/vinylester composite in tension–tension axial fatigue for R ratios 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9, and test frequencies 1, 3 and 5 Hz. The laboratory test data support the lower bound confidence level. This lower bound may be used in designing E-glass FRP composites for use in civil engineering structures conservatively estimating tension–tension axial fatigue life with test frequency 5 Hz or less. This lower bound may be used until further studies refine the effects of the individual test parameters on fatigue life.",

Theoretical comparisons show that exfoliated LAS offer superior reinforcement to glass fibers owing to the filler&#039;s high modulus, high aspect ratio, and its ability to reinforce in two directions. The effect of incomplete exfoliation of simple stacks of LAS on nanocomposite modulus was also examined. Increasing the number of platelets per stack and the gallery spacing between platelets results in a dramatic decrease in reinforcing efficiency. The predictions were benchmarked against experimental data for nylon 6 nanocomposites based on organically modified montmorillonite and glass fibers. The quantitative determination of the morphology of the nanocomposites is non-trivial due to the large distribution of filler shapes and sizes present. Thus, a detailed experimental procedure for determining the aspect ratio of the nanocomposites is reported. The composite theories satisfactorily capture the stiffness behavior of both types of composites. Furthermore, experimental heat distortion temperatures and those predicted from modeling the dynamic mechanical properties of nanocomposites are in reasonable agreement. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Experimental temporary fiber reinforced (TFC) composite resin was prepared by mixing 15 wt% of short E-glass fibers (3 mm in length) with a 35 wt% of semi-IPN-resin (dual or chemical cure) with 50 wt% of silane treated particulate silica fillers using a high speed mixing device. Temporary crowns (n=6) and test specimens (2 x 2 x 25 mm3) (n=6) were made from the experimental TFC and conventional TCB composite (control, Protemp Garant, 3M-ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA). A three-point bending test was done according to ISO standard 10477, and a compression loading test was carried out using a steel ball (Ø 3.0 mm) with a speed of 1.0 mm/min until fracture occurred. The degree of monomer conversion (DC%) of both composites was determined by Fourier transfer infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. RESULTS: The analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed both dual and chemical cure experimental TFC composite resins had statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) higher flexural strengths (117 and 99 MPa, respectively) and compressive load-bearing capacity (730 and 623 N, respectively) compared to the control TCB composite resin (72 MPa, 549 N). CONCLUSION: The use of short fiber fillers with semi-IPN polymer matrix yielded an improved mechanical performance compared to a conventional TCB composite resin.",

In order to predict the performance of the cutting tools in the industrial environment, extended drilling tests (up to 24000 holes) were conducted and the influence of changes in the geometry of the drills on the thrust force was assessed. The results indicated that the high speed steel tool presented remarkable wear rates, which drastically altered its edge preparation and resulted in a thrust force of 492 N after 1000 holes. In opposition to that, the cemented carbide drill presented superior wear resistance, with a thrust force of 147 N after drilling 24000 holes. Finally, the use of the titanium nitride coated drill did not offer a significant contribution neither to the tool wear resistance nor to the machining thrust force.

The degree of monomer conversion was determined for both adhesives in three settings (n = 5 per group): in the first group, the adhesive was cured without a bracket (control); in the second group, the bracket was bonded using adhesive without fiber reinforcement; and in the third group, a layer of glass-fiber net was added between the bracket and resin. The adhesive resin was light cured, and the DC% was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.\n\nRESULTS: A two-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences in the DC% (P &lt; .001) between adhesives and between the fiber-reinforced and nonreinforced groups. When the nonreinforced adhesives were light cured under the brackets, the DC% was significantly lower (TB: 37.0%, SD 3.4; BO: 36.9%, SD 1.9) compared with the control (TB: 54.7%, SD 0.6; BO: 65.9%, SD 0.5). A higher DC% was found when the resin was light cured in the presence of a glass-fiber net (TB: 44.1%, SD 0.3; BO: 55.3%, SD 1.7).\n\nCONCLUSION: The hypothesis is rejected. The degree of monomer conversion of the light-curing adhesive resin under stainless steel bracket can be improved by adding a thin layer of glass-fiber-reinforced composite between the bracket and adhesive resin.",

This study aims to verify changes in chemical composition and thermal stability of the ramie fibers after washing with distilled water. One additional goal is to study glass fiber and washed ramie fiber composites focusing on the effect of varying both the fiber length (25, 35, 45 and 55 mm) and the fiber composition. The overall fiber loading was maintained constant (21 vol.%). Based on the results obtained, the washed ramie fiber may be considered as an alternative for the production of these composites. The higher flexural strength presented being observed for 45 mm fiber length composite, although this difference is not significant for lower glass fiber volume fractions: (0:100) and (25:75). Also, by increasing the relative volume fraction of glass fiber until an upper limit of 75%, higher flexural and impact properties were obtained.",

The bolt-type bearing tests on GLass REinforced aluminum laminates (GLARE), non-commingled hybrid boron/glass/aluminum fiber/metal laminates (HFML) and COBRA were carried out as a function of e/. D ratio, metal volume fraction, fiber volume fraction, and fiber orientation. Experimental results show that with the same joint geometry and metal volume fraction, the commingling of boron fibers improves the bearing strength of fiber/metal laminates. Observations show the boron/glass fiber prepreg, transverse to the loading direction, results in a bearing mechanism that effectively increases the bearing strength. The bearing strength of COBRA with longitudinal fibers is lower than that with transverse fibers due to the fact that shearout failure takes place before maximum bearing strength is reached. The experimental results show that, with only either transverse fiber orientation or longitudinal fiber orientation, COBRA with 18% boron fiber volume fraction possesses a higher bearing strength when compared to HFML with 6% boron fiber volume fraction. In addition to the properties in COBRA with parallel-plies commingled prepreg, the bearing properties of various COBRA with [0??/90??] and [0??/90??/90??/0??] cross-ply commingled prepregs are also discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The polymeric materials were blended using twin-screw extruder and subsequently injection molded for test samples. Mechanical properties were investigated in terms of hardness, tensile strength, and impact strength. Friction and wear experiments were run under ambient conditions at a rotating speed of 200 rpm and load of 100 N. The morphologies of the worn surfaces were also observed with scanning electron microscope. The results showed that graphite could increase the tensile strength of PA6/GF-15 composite, but the material became soft. Graphite/UHMWPE complex solid lubricants were effective in increasing the already high impact strength of PA6/GF-15 composite. 5% PTFE gave the maximum reduction in the coefficient of friction. However, PTFE/UHMWPE complex solid lubricants were the best choice for improving both friction and wear behaviors due to the lower friction coefficient and mass wear rate. Moreover, the worn surface of PA6 composites revealed that adhesive wear, abrasive wear, and fatigue wear occurred in this study.",

The void content and fiber volume fraction of a VARTM part can be affected by many parameters and is critical to the mechanical properties and the quality of the part. In this paper, a series of experiments were conducted with a heated dual pressure control VARTM setup for investigating the effects of vacuum pressure, inlet pressure, and mold temperature on the void content and fiber volume fraction of polyester/E-glass fiber composite. It was found that stronger vacuum and higher mold temperature can better control and increase the fiber volume fraction; however, such a combination of strong vacuum and high mold temperature may also require a reduced inlet pressure for minimizing the void content. The need of pressure reduction can be explained with the compatibility between Darcy’s flow and capillary flow in the fiber preform and can be calculated based on the room temperature VARTM results. The experimental results suggest that high mold temperature, high vacuum, and appropriately reduced inlet pressure can produce a VARTM part with high fiber volume fraction and low void content.",

The purpose of this study was to study how the compression of the glass-fiber reinforced framework would affect the microcirculation of the facial skin. Materials and methods. A face mask, with a compression pad corresponding to the outer margin of a glass fiber-reinforced composite framework beam of a facial prosthesis, was used to apply pressure on the facial skin of healthy volunteers. The skin blood flow during touch, light and moderate compression of the skin was measured by laser Doppler imaging technique. Results. None of the compressions had any marked effects on local skin blood flow. No significant differences between the blood flow of the compressed skin, compared to the baseline values, were found. Conclusions. The pressure applied to the skin by the tight margins of a facial prosthesis, fabricated with a framework of glass-fiber reinforced composite, does not remarkably alter the skin blood flow. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.",

          "abstract": "Composites have recently gained considerable acceptance in the transportation sector such as the aerospace and automotive industries, as these materials offer the ability to reduce weight, greenhouse gas emissions and associated fuel cost. Conversely, problems related to material behavior, cost, manufacturing process, assembly and choice of joining technique pose challenges that limit the wide acceptance and implementation of the composite materials. Specifically, a major problem related to joining is the use of mechanical/fastener joints with drilled holes that can damage the continuous fibers and cause considerable reduction in the load carrying capacity of resulting composite structures.To address this issue, an innovative solution that manufactures fabric laminates using &#039;tailored placement&#039; of fibers around the holes/notch was proposed. This eliminates the need for drilling and machining of holes thereby eliminating the sources of delamination. The tensile performance of notched composites from the novel tailored fiber placement (TFP) approach was compared to conventional notched composites. Additionally, the effect of various fiber placement patterns and machining processes on the strength, damage initiation and fracture mode of notched composite laminates were studied. Specifically, the stress and strain fields around the notch were thoroughly evaluated. The experimental results for notched specimens were compared with the damage initiation and strength predictions obtained from the Hashin failure criteria as available in commercially available FEA package (ABAQUS??). A good agreement between experimental results and numerical predictions was observed. Overall, the proposed approach shows great promise in the use of tailored fiber placement technique to eliminate delaminations, maintain continuous fiber alignments and reduce associated stress concentrations in a wide range of composite applications including but not limited to mechanical fastening.",

Descriptions of the chemical and mechanical nature of the siloxane interphases that bond the polymer matrix to the reinforcing phase and their effects on the mechanical properties of fiber reinforced composites are described. While protection of the reinforcement from environmental damage and improvement of adhesion between phases have been well documented, neither the characterization of the properties of the interphase nor its consequences on the durability of a composite material have been definitively resolved. It is generally agreed, however, that synthetically created interphases are often mechanical weak links and a potential source for the initiation of defects in a structure. Recent research has focused on the attainment of monomolecular, reactive surface layers that form strong chemical bonds with both constituents. In this case, the polymeric `interphases&#039; are reduced in dimension to as close to a true `interface&#039; as molecular dimensions allow.

PURPOSE: The clinical performance of 31 resin-bonded, glass fiber-reinforced composite fixed partial dentures was evaluated in a preliminary study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prostheses were made to replace 1 to 3 missing maxillary or mandibular teeth in each of 31 patients. The prostheses had a framework made of continuous unidirectional E-glass fibers with multiphase polymer matrix and light-polymerized particulate composite resin veneering. The prostheses were examined after 6-month periods for up to 24 months (mean follow-up time was 14 months). Partial or total debonding of the prostheses or the framework fracture was considered a treatment failure. RESULTS: Two prostheses debonded during the follow-up period; 1 debonding was related to improper occlusal adjustment and the other to unknown reasons. Kaplan-Meier survival probability at 24 months was 93%. No framework fractures were observed. CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary study suggest that the resin-bonded, glass fiber-reinforced FPDs may be an alternative for resin-bonded FPDs with a cast metal framework.",

Although dielectrometry is more convenient in measuring the cure status of resin than differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the former requires complicated calculation to yield the cure information from the dissipation factor of the resin because the measured dissipation factor of the resin by dielectrometry contains viscosity information rather than the degree of cure of the resin.

Results indicate that Zr47Ti13CU11Ni10Be16Nb3 melt wets the W substrate, and the interfacial bond composed of a diffusion-dissolution layer between Zr17Ti13Cu11Ni10Be16Nb3 matrix and W fiber is in good condition. Due to these excellent interfacial characteristics, the mechanical properties of the composite are considerably enhanced with increasing volume fraction of W fiber. It was found that the compressive strength of 70% volume fraction of W fiber composite is 2.6 GPa, which is 58% higher than the value exhibited by the unreinforced matrix. At the same time, the reinforced matrix exhibits 13% plastic deformation when tested under quasi-static compression conditions. Instead of shear mode seen for the unreinforced matrix, the failure mode of the 70% volume fraction W fiber composite is mainly caused by fiber splitting and buckling. Also, the W fiber hinders localized shear bands from propagating and gives rise to multiple shear bands, which results in the enhancement of the compressive strength and plastic deformation.",

          "abstract": "For over two decades the single-filament-composite (SFC) test has been an important tool in the study of the failure of fibrous composites. The SFC test itself involves a single brittle fiber embedded along the center-line of a matrix specimen of both large cross-sectional area and strain to failure. With increasing strain, the fiber fractures progressively, breaking into an increasing number of shorter and shorter fragments. Surrounding each break a shielded or exclusion zone develops within which no further breaks typically occur. At some strain level [`]saturation&#039; occurs abruptly as the shielded zones finally occupy the whole fiber, thus leaving a final distribution of fiber fragments end-to-end. Two uses for the SFC test have emerged: one has been to estimate the interfacial shear stress, [tau], in the exclusion zone, sometimes called the interfacial shear strength and usually idealized as a constant over this zone. The other has been to estimate the fiber strength distribution and in particular the Weibull shape and scale parameters, [rho] and [sigma]l, for fiber strength appropriate to some characteristic [`]gage&#039; length, l, such as the mean fragmentation length. In the past, theoretical bases for these estimates have handled the statistics of shielding in ways that have led to quite large biases. The purpose of the present paper is to use some recent theoretical advances to develop more sophisticated estimation procedures for [tau] and the Weibull fiber strength parameters [`] in situ&#039;, and thus to eliminate various errors in previous methods.

Nonstandardized box dimensions for inlay-retained fixed partial dentures (FPDs) may result in uneven distribution of the forces on the connector region of such restorations. Purpose. The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of box dimensions on the initial and final failure strength of inlay-retained fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) FPDs. Material and methods. Twenty-one inlay-retained FPDs were prepared using FRC (everStick) frameworks with unidirectional fiber reinforcement between mandibular first premolars and first molars. Boxes were prepared using conventional inlay burs (Cerinlay), and small and large ultrasonic tips (SONICSYS approx). Box dimensions were measured after preparation with a digital micrometer. All restorations were subjected to thermal cycling (6000 cycles, 5??C-55??C). Fracture testing was performed in a universal testing machine (1 mm/min). Acoustic emission signals were monitored during loading of the specimens. Initial and final fracture strength values (2-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc tests, ??=.05) and failure types (Fisher exact test) were statistically compared for each group. Results. Significant differences (P=.0146 and P=.0086) were observed between the groups in the dimensions of the boxes prepared using conventional burs buccolingually (2.8-3.0 mm in molars, 3.1-4.3 mm in premolars) and the small size (2.5-2.9, 2.9-3.8 mm) or large size (2.6-3.8, 3.2-4.9 mm) ultrasonic tips for the premolars and the molars, respectively. No significant differences were found at the initial and final failures between the conventionally prepared group (842 ?? 267 N, 1161 ?? 428 N) and those prepared with either small (1088 ?? 381 N, 1320 ?? 380 N) or large ultrasonic tips (1070 ?? 280 N, 1557 ?? 321 N), respectively. The failure analysis demonstrated no significant difference in failure types but predominant delamination of the veneering resin (85%) in all experimental groups. According to acoustic emission tests, a higher energy level was required for final failure of the FRC FPDs with boxes finished using small ultrasonic tips. Conclusion. Standardized box dimensions showed no significant effect on fracture strength at either initial or final failure of the fiber-reinforced FPDs. The FRC FPDs with boxes refined with small ultrasonic burs required a greater energy level before failure. The type of failure observed after the fracture tests was primarily delamination of the veneering resin. Copyright ?? 2005 by The Editorial Council of The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

Despite of the rapid development of separators in recent years, there are remaining barriers such as proton transfer limitation and oxygen leakage, which increase the internal resistance and decrease the MFC performance, and thus limit the practical application of MFCs.

In addition, recent progresses in separator configuration, especially the development of separator electrode assemblies, are summarized. The advances in separator materials and configurations have opened up new promises to overcome these limitations, but challenges remain for the practical application. Here, an outlook for future development and scaling-up of MFC separators is presented and some suggestions are highlighted.",

For our flow program, a novel fiber optic real-time sensor system has been developed that can sense resin at various locations on a single fiber using long-period gratings and a polychromatic source. The sensor operation and characterization will be discussed along with sensor performance during mold filling with various types of reinforcement. The cure sensing program focuses on the interface-sensitive fluorescence response of a dye molecule grafted to a high-index glass fiber. The fluorescence emission of the fluorophore undergoes a blue shift as the resin cures. The fluorescence sensor is made by grafting a silane functional fluorophore onto the surface of the glass with close attention to layer thickness. Fluorescence emission of the grafted fluorophore film is shown to be sensitive to epoxy resin cure, co-silane, and layer thickness. The response of the grafted fluorophore to cure on a high-index fiber is demonstrated.",

Glass fiber posts may influence fracture resistance and should be evaluated.\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of glass fiber post length on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty intact human maxillary canines were selected and divided into 4 groups, the control group consisting of teeth restored with a custom gold cast post and core, with a length of two-thirds of the root. Other groups received prefabricated glass fiber posts in different lengths: group 1/3, removal of one-third of the sealing material (5 mm); group 1/2, removal of one-half of the sealing material (7.5 mm); and group 2/3, removal of two-thirds of the sealing material (10 mm). All the posts were cemented with resin cement, and the specimens with glass fiber posts received a composite resin core. All the specimens were restored with a metal crown and submitted to a compressive load until failure occurred. The results were evaluated by 1-way ANOVA, and the all pairwise multiple comparison procedures (Tukey honestly significantly difference test) (α=.05).\n\nRESULTS: The ANOVA showed significant differences among the groups (P&lt;.002). The Tukey test showed that the control group presented significantly higher resistance to static load than the other groups (control group, 634.94 N; group 1/3, 200.01 N; group 1/2, 212.17 N; and group 2/3, 236.08 N). Although teeth restored with a cast post and core supported a higher compressive load, all of them fractured in a catastrophic manner. For teeth restored with glass fiber posts, the failure occurred at the junction between the composite resin core and the root.\n\nCONCLUSION: The length of glass fiber posts did not influence fracture load, but cast post and cores that extended two-thirds of the root length had significantly greater fracture resistance than glass fiber posts.",

The existing knowledge about the fatigue characteristics of such composites leads to rather conservative designs which are over dimensioned and hence costly. The aim of this work is the development of an approach for the characterization of composites under cyclic loadings. An investigation is performed on the reduction of stiffness and the heat generated during the progression of damage. It is shown that even in the matrix mode failure the fatigue limit can be above the monotonic damage criterion, where the composite losses its rigidity either due to plasticity or matrix fiber separation. Thus showing that polyester resins are rather brittle in nature and brittle material fracture models can be used for modeling these composites in fatigue. However the role of fibers in initiation or arresting of the cracks is not presented in this study. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this context of saving weight, composites offer an alternative to metals because they can achieve a better stiffness to weight ratio. A problematic becomes crucial: which process can be used to join efficiently composite and metallic parts? An innovative way would be the application of self-piercing riveting to thermoplastic composite-metal structure. Since the self-piercing riveting does not require a pre-drilled hole, the time process is short. Nevertheless, this process generates damage in the composite such as fiber cutting and delamination. The aim of this work is to evaluate the fatigue strength of a PA6.6-GF (Glass Fiber reinforced Polyamide 6.6)/Aluminum assembly joined by self-piercing riveting. Experimental results show that the SPR joint achieve high fatigue resistance on uniaxial shearing test. The joint strength at 2??106 cycles is more than half of the joint strength in static. Joint manufacturing process parameters like the rivet shape were investigated. Some fatigue tests were performed under severe environmental conditions like high temperature. This study shows that process parameters have less influences on the joint strength than the parameters that impact the composite resistance such as the composite type and the test temperature. The composite stresses evolution is useful for the failure modes analyses.",

The two composite systems showed similar short-term mechanical properties, however their long-term creep properties were quite different. The E-glass/polyurethane system exhibited tertiary creep leading to rupture within a few hours when subjected to about 60% of its flexural strength while the E-glass/epoxy endured months of loading at 60% of its flexural strength before rupture at 50 °C. The findings in this study indicate that creep testing is essential in material characterization and material selection, that the three-point flexure test can be used as a quick test method to determine creep-rupture properties, and that creep-rupture is highly influenced by the type of matrix and the fiber/matrix interface. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The damaged composite is expressed as two regions of non-charred and charred materials. Homogenization methods are used to formulate the damaged material in terms of the volume fractions associated with composite fiber, resin and char. Equations are derived that employ Darcy&#039;s law to account for the gas transport within the structure. Mechanical response of the composite is taken into account by solving a homogenized system of linear elasticity equations which introduces the gas-phase pressure in a self-consistent manner. A finite element method is developed to solve the thermal and mechanical equations for a two-dimensional clamped composite beam subject to thermal radiative heating. Overall, good agreement is obtained between the numerical predictions and experimental data for temperature and gas pressure. Results show the decomposition of the resin and char formation create local stress concentrations across the pyrolysis front. The origin of these stresses are from thermal expansion and contraction across the front and the generation of locally high pore gas pressures from resin decomposition. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The model considers the main thermal processes and softening (mechanical) processes of fiberglass composites in fire that ensure an accurate calculation of tensile strength and failure time. The thermal component of the model considers the effects of heat conduction, matrix decomposition and volatile out-gassing on the temperature--time response of composites. The mechanical component of the model considers the tensile softening of the polymer matrix and glass fibers in fire, with softening of the fibers analyzed as a function of temperature and heating time. The model can calculate the tensile strength of a hot, decomposing composite exposed to fire up to the onset of flaming combustion. The thermal-mechanical model is confined to hot, smoldering fiberglass composites prior to ignition. Experimental fire tests are performed on dry fiberglass fabric and fiberglass/vinyl ester composite specimens to validate the model. It is shown that the model gives an approximate estimate of the tensile strength and time-to-failure of the materials when exposed to one-sided heating at a constant heat flux. It is envisaged the model can be used to calculate the tensile softening and time-to-failure of glass--polymer composite structures exposed to fire.",

Experimental FRC posts were fabricated with glass, aramid, and UHMWP fibers. Commercial FRC posts were used for comparison. A three-point bending test was performed at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Experimental glass fiber posts showed significantly higher flexural strengths and moduli than aramid and UHMWP posts. Experimental UHMWP posts demonstrated superior toughness to the commercial posts. The glass fiber posts displayed stiff, strong and brittle features, while the UHMWP posts were flexible, weak and ductile. The flexural properties of the aramid posts fell between those of the glass and UHMWP posts. In conclusion, the glass fiber posts proved excellent in flexural strengths and moduli. However, the superior toughness of UHMWP fibers suggests the possibility of their use as posts in combination with glass fibers.",

The specimen thickness and lay-up sequence had little effect on the through-the-thickness water absorption behavior of composite laminates, but the other parameters affected the moisture absorption rate and equilibrium water uptake in different ways and intensities. The glass transition temperature of composite laminates was strongly affected and linearly decreased by the quantity of equilibrium water uptake. A characteristic length of moisture migration through the unidirectional laminates was proposed as a function of fiber angle to the exposed laminate surface. In this approach, the fibers imbedded in the matrix were assumed to act as a barrier to the penetrating water molecules, and the developed model was well compared with the experimental results.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Laboratory tests confirmed superior physical properties of fiber-reinforced resin composites; however, clinical failures continue to be observed. This in vitro study introduces a new method to measure strain and fracture resistance in glass fiber-reinforced pontics. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Thirty standardized pontics in five groups were fabricated. Pontics were reinforced with: glass fiber (group 1); glass-fiber bundle surrounded by glass-fiber mesh (group 2); glass fiber with glass-fiber mesh parallel to the pontic&#039;s occlusal surface (group 3); or glass-fiber mesh parallel to glass-fiber bundle (group 4). Unreinforced resin composite pontics served as controls (group 5). A laser interferometer measured inner strains (microm/mm) in sectioned pontics, occlusally loaded with 250 N and 450 N, with a universal testing machine. Inner strains were measured on three levels (1, 2, and 3). Specimens were then loaded to crack onset, and loads were recorded. Comparisons were made using analysis of variance. Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher&#039;s exact tests were used, respectively, for nonparametric and categorical data. RESULTS: Group 3 showed significantly lower mean strain values than controls. No significant differences in maximal inner strain values or crack onset loads were recorded. The framework of Group 3 inhibited crack propagation significantly better than that in groups 2 and 5. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, speckle interferometry proved to be a promising method for analyzing strains of pontics under load. The tested framework designs in this study had only limited influence on load-to-crack onset. When strategically placed, a glass-fiber mesh prevented crack propagation.",

The surface properties of sugar palm fiber (Arenga pinnata) were modified using seawater and freshwater as treatment substances. This led to biological, chemical, and water degradation of the sugar palm fiber. Morphological and structural changes in the fibers were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A series of tensile tests based on ASTM D638-99 was carried out on epoxy composites with 15% sugar palm fiber by volume. It was found that seawater and freshwater treatments improved the surface properties of the sugar palm fiber and thus resulted in better adhesion quality as compared to untreated fiber. An improvement in tensile strength also supported this finding. Treatment with seawater for 30 days proved to be the best, with 67.26% increase in tensile strength.",

This paper in concerned with the rate dependency of mechanical behavior of a type of these composites, namely RE200 glass/epoxy, at low strain rates. With this regard, several tensile tests were carried out by employing a 600 kN Instron testing machine. The experiments were conducted at strain rates ranging from 0.0001 to 0.11 s-1 with specimens having different fiber orientations. Based on the results obtained in this research work, the longitudinal strength and stiffness increased 24.7% and 4.2%, respectively, by increasing the strain rate from 0.0001 to 0.11 s-1. This implies that certain mechanical properties of some polymer matrix composites could be rate dependant, even at low strain rates. To evaluate the ultimate strength of the glass/epoxy composite under consideration in terms of strain and strain rate, employing the experimental findings obtained in the present investigation, some relationships are proposed in this paper. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "In this paper we present a viewpoint on modeling the lifetime of glass fiber/polymer matrix composite structures loaded primarily in tension along the fiber axis. In many applications such components may sustain, over many years and in deleterious environments, stress levels that are a significant fraction of their ultimate tensile strength. Thus the failure phenomenon of concern is creep rupture. Ideally, a comprehensive model should incorporate such features as environmentally driven, statistical degradation mechanisms in the glass fiber (such as stress corrosion cracking), creep and microcracking of the polymer matrix, slip at the fiber/matrix interface near fiber breaks, local residual stresses from processing, including their complex micromechanical interactions. Such a model should yield overall distributions for lifetime in terms of the overall applied stress field, the overall volume of material, and boundary effects. Parameters of the model should reflect subtle scaling relationships among microstructural variables (e.g., fiber packing geometry), parameters of the statistics of fiber strength and degradation, matrix and interface creep exponents, rate factors in the stress-corrosion chemistry, and applied stress level. Particular attention must be paid to the character of the extreme lower tails of the strength and lifetime distributions since these are crucial in establishing load levels that result in the extremely high reliability levels important in life-safety applications. For example, the model should be able to predict the steady load level in a composite specimen with an effective loaded volume that yields a given lifetime (e.g., 25 years) at an extremely low probability of failure (e.g., 10-6). This essentially rules out mean field approaches so prevalent in the mechanics and physics community. A model of this sort would also be useful in the development of strategies for effective accelerated testing and data interpretation using special time-temperature scalings and master curves. Lastly, the model would have value in guiding strategies for quality control, materials processing, and component architecture during manufacture. Of course, such a comprehensive model is well beyond the present state of the art. Nevertheless, a surprising amount of progress has been made in developing the necessary conceptual and computational framework including the micromechanics, chemistry and physics of the fundamental failure mechanisms. In this paper we will review some of the relevant literature and suggest directions that should be fruitful in yielding useful models.",

The processing parameters peculiar to the growth system, specifically growth chamber temperature, catalyst concentration and line speed, were varied to observe the effect on the CNS growth and parent filament degradation. Unidirectional tension and compression tests were conducted to measure the strength and modulus in the filament direction and failure mechanisms of the hybrid materials identified. Based on the results of tensile tests, gains in tensile strength and tensile modulus are achieved through a uniform coverage of short CNS. The greatest increases in CNS-enhanced composite compressive strength can be achieved through the combination of low weight percent CNS on the fiber and minimal parent filament environmental degradation. For stiffness governed applications, these CNS-enhanced composites may not provide the ideal solution. However, applications which demand significant deformation prior to failure or damage tolerance can benefit from the properties afforded by these CNS-fiber-epoxy composites. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

In order to fully utilize these properties, numerous carbon nanotube/polymer composite fibers have been produced and investigated. In this review, we summarize recent developments in terms of methods of fiber formation and their resulting properties. Polymer/carbon nanotube fibers can be processed using melt or solution spinning. Solutions spinning technologies Byung Gil Min et al. 44 include wet, dry, dry-jet, and gel spinning. Fibers can also be spun using electro spinning. Carbon nanotubes used can be single-wall, double-wall, multi-wall, or vapor grown carbon nano fibers. Most composite fibers processed to date contain less than 10 wt% carbon nanotubes, though there are a few studies where carbon nanotube content is 60 wt% or higher. In most cases, the addition of carbon nanotube results in increased tensile and compressive properties, enhanced fatigue resistance, increased solvent resistance, as well as increased glass transition temperature. Carbon nanotubes act as a template for polymer orientation and a nucleating agent for polymer crystallization. This ability of carbon nanotubes is expected to have profound impact on polymer and fiber processing, as well as on the resulting morphology and properties. The results of studies carried out to date are briefly reviewed in this paper.",

Joints of non-conductive thermoplastic composite materials are processed by Resistance Welding (RW) by incorporating a conductive corrosion resistive conductive material, as an interlayer. Glass fiber reinforced polypropylene thermoplastic composite sheets were used for this study. The experimental set-up for resistance welding was fabricated. Welding current, clamping pressure and welding duration (Time) are the control parameters. The joining trials on composites were carried out using Taguchi method to reduce time and cost effective experimental studies. The effect of parameters which govern the quality of resistance welding of thermoplastic composites is also emphasized in this work. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimum process parameters for RW. The joints obtained were analyzed microscopically; it revealed the good integration of thermoplastic composite with the interlayer material. The mechanical strength of the joints is tested through lap shear strength testing.",

Methods: Rhombic polymer and FRC test specimens made of three commercially available diacrylate resin (Sinfony Activator, Triad Gel, 3M Scotchbond Adhesive) and different volume fractions of fibers were tested with three-point bending test according to ISO 10477 after storing in water for 30 days. Water sorption of specimens was also measured. Results: Flexural strength of specimens with 45vol% fraction E-glass fibers varied from 759 to 916MPa in dry conditions. Water-stored specimens showed flexural strengths of 420-607MPa. ANOVA analysis revealed that the fiber-volume fraction and the water sorption of the polymer matrix had a significant effect (p&lt;0.001) on the flexural properties. Dehydration of specimens recovered the mechanical properties. Decrease of flexural properties after water immersion was considered to be mainly caused by the plasticizing effect of water and the decrease depended on water sorption. Significance: Use of polymers with low-water sorption seems to be beneficial in order to optimize the flexural properties of FRC. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The analytical expression for calculation of stiffness and stress for both laminate plates were derived. The failure analyses were carried out for both the laminate plate by using maximum stress criteria to avoid failure during real time application of laminate structure. The fiber materials, which are used to prepare a laminates, are chopped strand mat (CSM) glass fiber (random orientation), woven roving mat (WRM) glass fiber (Cross ply orientation of 00 &amp; 900) and unidirectional glass fiber (UDF) with polyester resin. The existing composite plate and modified composite plate were prepared by 16% and 23% of fiber volume fraction respectively. The manufacturing method was used to produce a laminate plates is by hand lay-up process. The laminates were prepared by different stacking sequence and thickness to produce a symmetric and non-symmetric laminates. The laminate structures are [5 CSM, 1 WRM] and [4 CSM, 1UDF]. The specimens were cut as per ASTM and BS standards from the both laminates and tested in Instron Universal Testing Machine. The mechanical properties such as Tensile, Flexure and Interlaminar shear of composite were tested and compared. It was found that a modified symmetric laminate is a suitable laminate for the manufacture of fishing boat.",

When plates were welded along their molded-edges, weld strengths were observed to be in the range of 15-30 MPa depending on the welding parameters and material type. The weld strength was observed to decrease with increasing fiber content for all materials and welding conditions studied. If, however, the plates were welded along machined edges, it was possible to obtain weld strengths that approached those of the bulk composite material. Weld strengths of over 70 MPa were observed for 40% long-glass-fiber-reinforced polypropylene compounds welded under conditions of low pressure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bar-shaped specimens of each material were prepared according to the manufacturers&#039; instructions. The flexural strength and modulus of each specimen were tested after the specimens were immersed in distilled water for 1, 7, 60, and 180 days. SEMs were taken to examine the mode of failure. The volume percentage of fiber content of each fiber-reinforced composite was experimentally estimated. RESULTS: The ascending order of flexural strength and modulus among the materials was generally: FibreKor &lt; Stick &lt; Vectris. The flexural strengths of Stick and FibreKor specimens at 1 and 180 days were not significantly different. Although the 180-day Vectris specimens possessed significantly lower flexural strength than the 1-day specimens, the flexural strengths of Vectris specimens at 1, 7, 60, and 180 days remained significantly higher than those of Stick and FibreKor. The difference in flexural modulus for each fiber-reinforced composite related to the duration of water immersion was not significant. CONCLUSION: Water immersion affected the flexural strengths of the three composites to a different degree but did not affect their flexural moduli significantly. For each duration of water immersion, the flexural property of the fiber-reinforced composite, in ascending order of significant difference, was: FibreKor &lt; Stick &lt; Vectris.",

In the rupture test, while no obvious difference in rupture time was observed at larger deflections, glass- carbon hybrid samples showed prolonged rupture time in comparison to all-glass samples when loaded at 10% maximum deflection. When compared to samples tests in air, cyclic loading in water resulted in shorter fatigue lives for both all-glass and hybrid composite samples. However, hybrid samples showed better environmental fatigue resistance in water than all-glass samples, to 10 7 cycles. By incorporating appropriate amount of carbon fibers in glass fiber composite, long-term performance of glass-carbon hybrid composites under static and dynamic fatigue is substantially enhanced. It is demonstrated by the present study that the intra-ply hybrid approach is effective and economical in improving the durability of fiber reinforced polymer composites for long term applications.",

The stainless steel caps were adhesively bonded to the top and bottom areas of the glass composite body. The top stainless cap was then welded to the two stainless steel membranes, and the flange of the bottom stainless steel cap was bolt-fastened to the inner hull of a ship. The static adhesive strength and impact characteristics between the stainless steel caps and glass composite body of the hybrid glass composite anchor at the cryogenic temperature were investigated with respect to adhesive thickness.

The combination of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) profiles with fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) elements is being adopted in this type of structures, since the ductility, high post-cracking tensile strength, compressive stiffness and strength of FRC can be combined with the benefits derived from the use of FRP&#039;s profiles to obtain high performance structural systems. In the context of the present work a 12 m long single span pedestrian bridge with two composite I-profiles was designed. In terms of deflection requirements imposed by serviceability limit states, the influence of the height and thickness of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) profiles, as well as the addition of a thin layer of prestressed carbon fiber sheet in the bottom flange of the GFRP profile was evaluated. Using software based on the finite element method, the structural behavior of the developed structural systems was analyzed. Furthermore, two prototypes of this structural system were built and monitored in order to assess their long-term deformational behavior when subjected to a loading configuration correspondent to the load combination for the deflection serviceability limit states.

The flexural strength and elastic modulus of the immersed specimens were significantly lower than those of the dry specimens at the same cross-head speed and temperature. On the whole, the values were inferior to those of metal. The deflection increased significantly as the load increased, but there were no significant differences between the values of dry and immersed specimens. With increasing load and number of cycles, the permanent deformation of both specimens increased significantly. The permanent deformation was similar to that of Co-Cr alloy.

According to the scanning electron microscope (SEM), a mineral layer was formed on the surface of all the specimens, which were immersed with bioactive glass. The layer was thickened by the prolonged immersion time to a uniform layer. The Ca/P atomic ratio of the mineral varied between 1.30 and 1.54 as analyzed by the energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra gave signals for the mineral, which are characteristic of both bone-like apatite and orthocalciumphosphate.

The aim of this work is to study the fibers orientation and dispersion as well as the damage development of an injected PP/flax fiber composite. First, we studied the flax fiber orientation in the skin and core layers, and, to quantify the impact of fiber bundles, we evidenced their presence in injected specimens, and we focused on their effects on the tensile properties. Then, we correlated this morphology with the tensile properties of the various areas. Finally, we investigated the initiation and propagation of cracks into the PP/flax composite in tensile mode by using in situ SEM observations. Despite some differences, our results highlighted many similarities between the flax fiber and glass fiber composites, and evidenced some improvements to carry out in order to increase the part of industrial PP/vegetal fibers composites. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the bond strength of a silica glass-fiber-reinforced composite to polymer teeth compared with the bond strength of a proprietary heat-polymerized denture base polymer and also between a layer of the polymerized matrix polymer of the experimental base material and an additional layer of the same material.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Polymeric artificial maxillary incisors and two heat-polymerized base materials (ProBase Hot and an experimental formulation) were used. Three test groups (each n=6) were prepared: bonding between artificial tooth and an experimental composite (group-TC), bonding between tooth and ProBase Hot (group-TP), and bonding between experimental base material and experimental base material (group-BB). The content of inorganic particles of teeth was determined by combustion analysis. The bond strengths were measured in shear with a universal testing machine and the data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Scheffé test (p&lt;0.05). After failure, the fracture surfaces were examined by optical microscopy.\n\nRESULTS: The content of inorganic particles in the teeth was low. There is no statistically significant difference in bond strength between the groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Bond strength of the experimental composite to artificial polymer teeth was as good as that of a conventional heat-polymerized denture base polymer. The strong bonding between the experimental material and artificial teeth makes this combination suitable for resin-bonded prostheses.",

In this study, we prepared a new nondegradable bone plate composed of a ternary nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide 66/glass fiber (n-HA/PA66/GF) composite. A breakage area on the n-HA/PA66/GF plate surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Its mechanical properties were investigated using bone-plate constructs and biocompatibility was evaluated in vitro using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The results confirmed that adhesion between the n-HA/PA66 matrix and the glass fibers was strong, with only a few fibers pulled out at the site of breakage. Fractures fixed by the n-HA/PA66/GF plate showed lower stiffness and had satisfactory strength compared with rigid fixation using a titanium plate. Moreover, the results with regard to mesenchymal stem cell morphology, MTT assay, Alizarin Red S staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin showed that the n-HA/PA66/GF composite was suitable for attachment and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells, and did not have a negative influence on matrix mineralization or osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. These observations indicate that the n-HA/PA66/GF plate has good biomechanical properties and biocompatibility, and may be considered a new option for internal fixation in orthopedic surgery.",

The addition of the conductive CNT fiber to the non-conductive GFRP material aims to enhance its multi-function ability; the test specimen’s response to mechanical load and the in situ CNT fiber’s electrical resistance measurements were corre- lated for sensing and damage monitoring purposes. It is the first time this fiber is used in composite materials for sensing purposes; CNT fiber is easy to be embedded and does not downgrade the material’s mechanical properties. Various incremental loading–unloading steps had been applied to the manufac- tured specimens in tension as well as in three-point bending tests. The CNT fiber worked as a sensor in both, tensile and compression loadings. A direct correlation between the mechanical loading and the electrical resistance change had been established for the investigated specimens. For high stress (or strain) level loadings, residual resistance measurements of the CNT fiber were observed after unload- ing. Accumulating damage to the composite material had been calculated and was correlated to the elec- trical resistance readings. The established correlation between these parameters changed according to the material’s loading history. ",

PURPOSE: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of glass fiber layering on the flexural strength of microfill and hybrid composites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Flexural test specimens (N = 75) were prepared according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 4049 specifications (25 x 2 x 2 mm) by using a standard metallic mold. Materials used and groups were as follows (N = 15): group 1: hybrid composite (Clearfil APX, Kuraray Co.Ltd, Osaka, Japan); group 2: microfill composite (Clearfil ST, Kuraray Co.Ltd.); group 3: hybrid + microfill composite; group 4: woven glass fiber (EverstickNet, StickTech Ltd, Turku, Finland) + hybrid composite; group 5: woven glass fiber + microfill composite. The specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 7 days. Afterward, they were loaded to fracture (1 mm/min) by using a universal testing machine (AG-50 kNG Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). Flexural strengths were expressed as maximum flexural load per cross-sectional area of the specimen. The results were statistically analyzed with Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests (p &lt; 0.01). RESULTS: Significant increases in the flexural strength were found for both hybrid and microfill composites when fiber layering was used (group 1: 78 +/- 7 MPa; group 4: 93 +/- 4 MPa) (group 2: 42 +/- 5 MPa; group 5: 64 +/- 4 MPa) (p &lt; 0.01). Flexural strength of fiber-reinforced hybrid composite was significantly higher than the other groups evaluated (p &lt; 0.01). There were no significant differences in flexural strength between microfill/hybrid combination and fiber-reinforced microfill composite (p &gt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Glass fiber layering of microfill and hybrid composites presented higher flexural strength, and veneering of hybrid composite with microfill composite increased the resistance of the restoration.",

Two parameters of the materials composition are investigated, the fibre length and the quality of the fibre matrix adhesion. These parameters show a great influence on the damage mechanisms, on the mechanical properties and on the fatigue life of these four composite materials. The use of acoustic emission (AE) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations has enabled us to identify several damage mechanisms. Many differences in the damage mechanisms between the tensile and crack propagation tests were observed in the SEM photographs. A good correlation was observed between these mechanisms and several ranges of AE amplitude. The use of both techniques (AE and SEM) is shown to be very useful in the investigation of damage phenomena in composite materials. ?? 1994.",

Spectrophotometric experiments were performed on unidirectional and cross-ply glass fiber-reinforced polymer specimens with fiber volume fractions ranging from 0.20 to 0.45. Numerical ray-tracing analysis was used to investigate the experimentally observed wavelength dependency of the diffuse light transmittance. Refractive index mismatches between glass fibers and resin and the presence of air flaws in the laminates were the major parameters increasing light diffusion. Based on the experimental data, analytical models were developed to predict the translucency (haze) of glass fiber-reinforced polymer laminates as a function of the reinforcement weight and total light transmittance. The developed models demonstrate the feasibility of conceiving glass fiber-reinforced polymer skylights with a translucency of 0.90 and a total light transmittance of 0.50 for the daylighting of energy-efficient buildings. It is also shown that laminates with translucencies of lower than 0.30 satisfy minimum total transmittances of 0.83 as required for the encapsulation of photovoltaic cells.",

Three reactive silane coupling agents, with anhydride, epoxy, or amine functionality, were used and found to have little effect on the mechanical properties when no EPR-g-MA is present. When 20wt% EPR-g-MA is used as a rubber toughener, however, the yield strength and Izod impact strength were lowest for the amine functional silane and highest for the anhydride silane, while the epoxy silane fell in-between. These results were attributed to the differences in reactivity of the three reactive silanes. An unreactive silane (octyl groups) was used as a release agent on the glass fibers and compared with the anhydride functional silane. The octyl silane did not improve the ductility of the composite, as may have been speculated, and had poor yield strength and impact resistance when compared to the anhydride silane. Both octyl and anhydride treated glass fibers improve the heat distortion temperature such that most of the high temperature stiffness that is lost on addition of EPR-g-MA is regained by adding glass fibers.",

          "abstract": "Wind energy has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years in Jordan as one of the possible alternative renewable energy resources. Almost of the local research and development activities in this field were directed to explore, develop, and optimal utilization of energy systems. The time has come to establish a link between local scientific (academic) work and local industries to produce a usable technology which will increase the local share in an inevitably emerging wind energy industry in Jordan. To achieve this goal, a well founded manufacturing base is required. The most important component of a Wind Energy Converter is the rotor. The efficiency of a rotor is characterized by its profile (airfoil section) and the corresponding aerodynamic design. A selection procedure of airfoil section and the aerodynamic design of the blade for a small wind turbine are discussed and implemented in this paper (Part I). It is found that for small blades up to 5 m long, two different air foils mixed at the outer third of the span will be sufficient and demonstrated good strength and aerodynamic characteristics. As a composite material, the Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic was used in designing the rotor blade. This rotor was then installed on 15 kW grid-connected-pitch-controlled machine. A static proof load test indicated that this blade could withstand loads ten times the normal working thrust, and a field performance test showed that the rotor blade has a 41.2% measured average power coefficient.",

          "abstract": "Compressed air is used in a variety of industrial applications. For many of these applications the air must be treated to remove undesired contaminants such as solid particles and droplets of oil and water. Glass fiber filter media are often used to remove the oil droplets out of the compressed gas. This paper describes an experimental study to explore the effects of humidity and temperature on the performance of the glass fiber filter media. This work also considers the effects of the addition of polymer nanofibers to the glass fiber media on the filter performance. The results show that generally at higher temperatures the glass fiber media have better coalescence filtration performance. The glass fiber media also performed better with a humidity dewpoint of -15 °C compared with dewpoints of -10 and -20 °C, suggesting that there may be competing mechanisms affected by the humidity. The coalescence performance of the media improve significantly when nanofibers were added to the glass fiber media. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Continuous unidirectional E-glass fibers were preimpregnated with a novel biopolymer of poly(hydroxyproline) amide and ester. The preimpregnated fibers were then further impregnated in a co-monomer system of Bis-GMA-TEGDMA, which formed semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPN) with the preimpregnated polymer. After light initiated polymerization of the monomer system, rectangular shaped bar specimens (n = 4) were tested by the three-point bending test. The control material was a fiber-reinforced composite with a Bis-GMA-TEDGMA-matrix only. The mean flexural strength of poly(hydroxyproline) amide preimpregnated fiber composite was higher than that of the control (FS = 888 vs. 805 MPa). The poly(hydroxyproline) ester preimpregnated fibers resulted in lower strength (FS = 541 MPa). The results of this study suggest that preimpregnation of glass fibers with poly(hydroxyproline) amide and the use of such fibers in fiber-reinforced composites with IPN polymer matrices, can reach relatively high mechanical properties.",

A precursor solution of SKYBOND 703 was diluted in an additional solvent (n-methyl pyrrolidone) and the glass woven fabric was immersed in about 40 wt.% polyamic acid, in solvent. Prepregs were dried at 373 K for different time intervals, ranging from 2 to 24 h. Prepregs with varying residual solvent content under each condition were laid up, and their [(0/90)]4 composite laminates were formed by autoclaving at a hydrostatic pressure of 0.7 MPa. The relationship of drying time with the amount of residual prepreg solvent, as well as with the volume fractions of fiber and voids was investigated. The void geography and content for each composite laminate, and the tensile strength and modulus at room temperature were also evaluated. The results clearly indicated that, depending on the altering residual solvent content in the prepreg, the void geometry and location influenced reduction of the tensile properties of woven fabric composite laminate. An appropriate prepreg resin viscosity during curing, which avoids reduction of the tensile properties, was revealed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this study, two different fiber materials, namely, E-glass and carbon, with different architecture are chosen. Polymer (vinyl ester) based composites were designed using these fibers and were fabricated using VARTM process. These composites were subjected to quasi-static and high strain rates of loading utilizing different testing methodologies. In quasi-static testing, the tensile, compressive and shear properties were studied using existing ASTM standard testing procedures and the results are reported. The carbon composite showed higher tensile and compressive modulus. In-plane shear properties of both the composites were comparable and inter laminar shear properties of E-glass composites were observed to be better than the carbon composite because of the better nesting between the E-glass fabric layers. A shock tube and a controlled explosion tube were utilized in the study of dynamic damage behavior of these composite materials. Based on the experimental study, it is observed that the carbon fiber composites tend to achieve sudden destructive damage whereas E-glass fiber composites tend to sustain progressive damage, under dynamic loading. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, due to the lower modulus of elasticity, serviceability considerations such as deflection and crack width control present serious challenges to designers. This paper reports new means to address these issues by introducing engineered cementitious composite (ECC), which is designed based on micromechanics principles and exhibits higher tensile and shear ductility, to replace brittle concrete matrix. Three series, totaling 16 GFRP reinforced beams with various shear span-depth ratios and longitudinal reinforcement ratios, were tested. The results reveal that, under the same reinforcement configurations, ECC beams exhibit significant increases in flexural performance in terms of ductility, load-carrying capacity, shear resistance, and damage tolerance (such as crack width or spalling) compared with the counterpart high-strength concrete (HSC) beam. The extent of improvement strongly depended on the failure mode; that is, when the limit state was dominated by matrix behavior, more significant improvement was observed. Moreover, ECC beams without shear reinforcement demonstrate better performance than HSC beams with dense steel stirrups, which suggests that elimination of shear reinforcement is feasible when the concrete matrix is replaced by ECC.",

Additionally, little is known about the biomechanical performance of glass fiber and zircon posts.\n\nPURPOSE: This in vitro study investigated the fracture resistance of anterior endodontically treated teeth prepared with a 2-mm ferrule, restored with glass fiber and zircon posts and composite resin cores or cast posts and cores.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve matched pairs of teeth were obtained from 4 cadavers, and all were endodontically treated and prepared with a standardized 2-mm ferrule. According to a random number table, the 2 teeth from each matched pair were randomly divided into 2 groups. The test group consisted of 12 specimens restored with a glass fiber and zircon post (Fibio) and composite resin (Durafil) core. Twelve matching specimens restored with a nickel-chromium (NiCr) cast post and core served as the control. Specimens in both groups were cemented with resin cement (Panavia F). After cementation of cast NiCr complete crowns with zinc polycarboxylate cement (ShangChi), the specimens were loaded with an incremental static force at an angle of 135 degrees to the long axis of the root until failure occurred. A paired sample t test was used to compare the fracture resistance (N) of teeth restored with the 2 post-and-core systems (alpha=.05).\n\nRESULTS: The mean failure load of paired differences between the 2 groups was -261.3+/-237.3 N. The test group exhibited significantly lower failure loads than the control group (P=.004). All specimens displayed root fractures, most of which were oblique, with cracks initiating from the palatal cervical margin and propagating in a labial-apical direction.\n\nCONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, the teeth restored with glass fiber and zircon posts demonstrated significantly lower failure loads than those with cast NiCr post and cores. All specimens failed via root fractures.",

          "abstract": "This paper is primarily focused in studying the effects of nanoclay particles such as montmorillonite on improving mechanical and thermal properties of fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite materials. Basic correlations between polymer morphology, strength, modulus, toughness, and thermal stability of thermoset nanocomposites were investigated as a function of layered silicate content. S2-glass/epoxy-clay nanocomposites were manufactured through an affordable vacuum assisted resin infusion method (VARIM). The nanocomposites are formed during polymerization when the adsorbing monomer separates the clay particles into nanometer scales. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and wide angle X-ray diffraction(WAXD) were used to characterize the morphology of the dispersed clay particles. The thermal properties such as onset of decomposition and glass transition temperatures were determined by Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Dynamic Modulus Analyzer (DMA). Mechanical properties such as interlaminar shear strength, flexural properties and fracture toughness are also determined for both conventional S2-glass/epoxy composites and S2-glass fiber reinforced nanocomposites. The results show significant improvements in mechanical and thermal properties of conventional fiber reinforced composites with low loading of organo silicate nanoparticles. By dispersing 1% by weight nanosilicates, S2-glass/epoxy-clay nanocomposites attributed to almost 44, 24 and 23% improvement in interlaminar shear strength, flexural strength and fracture toughness in comparison to conventional S2-glass/epoxy composites. Similarly, the nanocomposites exhibit approximately 26 C higher decomposition temperatures than that of conventional composites. This improved properties of fiber reinforced polymer nanocomposites are achieved mostly due to increased interfacial surface areas, improved bond characteristics and intercalated/exfoliated morphology of the epoxy-clay nanocomposites. The TEM observations provide evidence of detailed morphology of the polymer layered-clay nanocomposites.",

          "abstract": "Fibre-orientation measurement by two-dimensional (2D) image analysis of polished cross-sections is a rapid and highly efficient method for determining the fibre orientation distribution over large sample areas. In a recent paper, a new technique was presented for measuring fibre orientation to a high level of accuracy by the use of a confocal microscope. In this paper, the confocal technique is used to evaluate independently the performance of the 2D image analysis technique and the errors are presented in full. The results reveal a significant systematic error in orientation measurements and the effect of image resolution is considered. A method is proposed for correcting this systematic error and its validity is verified experimentally. A technique for determining the sampling error of a fibre-orientation measurement is presented, enabling the calculation of confidence limits about the derived orientation tensor components. It is shown how confidence limits aid the comparison of two fibre-orientation measurements of similar samples. Furthermore, the sampling error should enable a more meaningful comparison of numerical simulation of injection moulded composites and their experimentally manufactured counterparts.",

In this research, the chromatic dispersion of soft glass highly nonlinear fibers was controlled by using the complex microstructure in the cladding. A tellurite glass fiber which had a 1.8 ??m core surrounded by four ring holes was fabricated. The preform was fabricated by the method of cast rod in tube and stack. The chalcogenide-tellurite glass composite fibers which had a 1.5 ??m core surrounded by tellurite microstructure cladding were demonstrated. Their preform was fabricated by the method of stack and draw. In the fiber-drawing process of both types of fibers an inflation pressure of nitrogen gas was pumped into the holes of the preform to overcome the surface tension and to reshape the microstructure. The tellurite complex microstructured fiber has a chromatic dispersion much more flattened than that of step-index air-clad fiber. The chalcogenide-tellurite glass composite fibers have the zero dispersion wavelength (ZDW) in the near-infrared range. Having the ZDW in the near-infrared has not been realized before for the fibers made from chalcogenide glass. Meanwhile, the composite microstructured fiber with large holes in the cladding has the highest nonlinearity of all highly nonlinear fibers if the tapered fibers are excluded. Supercontinuum spectra covering over one octave, free of fine structures, were demonstrated by the fabricated fibers. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The performance of fiber-reinforced composites is often controlled by the properties of the fiber–matrix interface. Good interfacial bonding (or adhesion), to ensure load transfer from matrix to reinforcement, is a primary requirement for effective use of reinforcement properties. Thus, a fundamental understanding of interfacial properties and a quantitative characterization of interfacial adhesion strength can help in evaluating the mechanical behavior and capabilities of composite materials. A large number of analytical techniques have been developed for understanding interfacial adhesion of glass-fiber-reinforced polymers. Among these techniques, the vibration damping technique has the advantage of being non-destructive as well as highly sensitive for evaluating the interfacial region, and it can allow the materials industry to rapidly determine the mechanical properties of composites. In the present study, a simple optical system was contributed for measuring the damping factor of uniaxial fiber-reinforced polymer composites in the shape of cantilever beams. The interfacial damping factors in glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy resin composites were correlated with transverse tensile strength, which is a qualitative measurement of adhesion at the fiber–matrix interface. Four different composite systems were tested in this study. In each system, three different surface treatments of glass-fiber at three different volume fractions were evaluated. The experimental results show an inverse relationship between damping contributed by the interface and composite transverse tensile strength.",

A detailed account is given of the two main modes of progressive crushing, splaying and fragmentation, which occur in tubes made from fibre-reinforced composite materials. The main theme of this paper is that the crush geometry and the force-displacement response are interrelated and that the wide range of material and testing variables which affect the crushing behaviour can be accounted for on this basis. By way of example, a detailed description is given of the effect of fibre arrangement on progressive crushing in carbon fibre-epoxy unidirectional laminated tubes, woven glass cloth-epoxy tubes, filament-wound angle-ply glass fibre-polyester tubes and inplane random chopped glass fibre-polyester tubes. Transitions between splaying and fragmentation modes are identified and related to the force-displacement response. Similar transitions have been reported with other variables, such as fibre and matrix properties, dimensions and shape of tubes, speed and temperature effects, and trigger geometries. These are discussed in the context of the overall theme.",

Maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) has been used as a coupling agent to improve the interfacial interaction between the fibers and matrix. The mechanical properties of the hybrid composites were studied from tensile, flexural, and impact tests. Mechanical tests indicated an increase in tensile, flexural, and impact strength of the BGRP hybrid composites at a bamboo:glass fiber ratio of 15:15 ratio in the presence of 2 wt% of MAPP. Nearly, 69, 86, and 83% increase in tensile flexural and impact strength respectively has been observed as compared with virgin PP. The fiber matrix interfacial morphology of the tensile fractured specimens was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which showed less fiber pullout and comparatively less gaps between the fiber and the base matrix in the case of MAPP treated hybrid composites. The crystallization, melting behavior and thermal stability of the hybrid composites were investigated employing differential scanning electron microscopy (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed an increase in thermal stability of the matrix polymer with incorporation of bamboo and glass fibers, confirming the effect of hybridization and efficient fiber matrix interfacial adhesion. The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) showed an increase in storage modulus (E&#039;) indicating higher stiffness in case of hybrid composites as compared with untreated composites and virgin matrix.

As a proof of concept demonstration, a sciatic nerve of a frog is stimulated by the microcrystal device connected to a multimode optical fiber (core diameter of 62.5 microm), which converts optical activation pulses ( approximately 100 micros) from an infrared semiconductor laser source (at 852 nm wavelength) into an FES signal.",

Thermal stresses were built-up in glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composites by upthermal shock cycles (negative to positive temperature exposure) for different durations and also by downthermal shock cycles (positive to negative temperature exposure). The concentration of thermal stresses often results in weaker fiber/matrix interface.

Fiber characteristics and the influences of fiber type and loading rate on HDPE crystallization behavior and composite mechanical properties were investigated. Fiber length and aspect ratio distributions for all fibers followed a lognormal distribution after milling with two parameters defining the curve location (i.e., mean fiber length/aspect ratio) and shape (i.e., mean fiber length/aspect ratio distribution). For both VHDPE and RHDPE, rice straw fiber systems had comparable mechanical properties with those of wood composites. Increase in fiber loading led to increased moduli and decreased tensile and impact strength. Composite panels with rice husk had the smallest storage moduli, but their impact strength was comparable or better than that of other straw fibers. Very little difference in mechanical properties existed among leaf, stem, and whole straw fibers. The particular recycled HDPE resin and its composites had significantly better moduli and strength properties compared to the virgin HDPE systems due to additives used during initial processing. X-ray diffraction experiments showed that introducing fiber to HDPE matrix did not change characteristic peak position, but the fiber increased crystalline thickness of HDPE system. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments showed that VHDPE had significantly larger peak heat flow during cooling run than the RHDPE, indicating higher crystallization rates for VHDPE. The use of fiber in both resin systems led to the reduced peak heat flow rate. The study showed that rice straw fibers can work well with both VHDPE and RHDPE as reinforcing filler. Future work will deal with effect of coupling treatments of the straw fibers in single phase or commingled plastics composite systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 48 FPDs were constructed from the glass fiber-reinforced materials FibreKor/Sculpture, Vectris/Targis, or the polyethylene fiber system BelleGlass/Connect (n = 16 for each brand). The reconstructions were conventionally luted on human molars using resin-modified ProTecCEM or Fuji Plus and then exposed to thermocycling and mechanical loading. RESULTS: During thermocycling and mechanical loading, cementation failed in seven of eight FibreKor or BelleGlass FPDs and in one of eight Vectris/Targis FPDs luted with ProTecCEM. All Fuji Plus-cemented FPDs showed no signs of damage or cementation loss. The fracture resistance of the remaining FPDs was as follows: Vectris/Targis-ProTecCem 1,361 +/- 360 N, Vectis/Targis-Fuji Plus 923 +/- 207 N, BelleGlass/Connect 940 +/- 155 N, and FibreKor/Sculpture 524 +/- 202 N. The marginal adaptation of the cement-tooth interface deteriorated by 13% to 21% for all reconstructions after stress application, which was not statistically significant. The crown-cement interface had a significantly greater marginal gap only with the combination of FibreKor and Fuji Plus after stress simulation (change 33%). CONCLUSION: Conventional cementation of fiber-reinforced FPDs can lead to cementation loss. The marginal adaptation and fracture resistance deteriorated in comparison to adhesively cemented reconstructions.",

The aim of the study consists on the evaluation of the substitution of the steel electronic rack, mounted on the helicopter Eurocopter AS 350 ??cureuil, with a new version, utilizing hemp fabric/epoxy composite material. This replacement will permit to have an environmental friendly product and lower disposal costs and weight. Lower weight for helicopters and more in general for aircraft means lower fuel consumption, lower pollution and costs. The new rack has been designed using structural static and dynamic analysis through Finite Element Method (FEM). Results are promising from the structural point of view. In fact, a weight reduction of 8.01 kg (55.6%) with respect to steel has been obtained without significantly increasing the production cost. A comparison with glass fabric/epoxy composites is also provided. The results for both the composite materials are very similar, but the advantages for the environment demonstrate that is worthy choosing natural fiber composites configuration.",

Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope were carried out to characterize this multiscale material. Compared with the original carbon fibers, the fabrication of this hybrid fiber resulted in an almost threefold increase of BET surface area to reach 2.22m2/g. Meanwhile, there was a slight degradation of fiber tensile strength within 10%, while the fiber modulus was not significantly affected. The interfacial shearing strength of a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composite with carbon nanotube-hybridized carbon fiber and an epoxy matrix was determined from the single fiber pull-out tests of microdroplet composite. Due to an efficient increase of load transfer at the fiber/matrix interfaces, the interracial shear strength of composite reinforced by carbon nanotube-hybridized carbon fiber is almost 94% higher than that of one reinforced by the original carbon fiber. Based on the fractured morphologies of the composites, the interfacial reinforcing mechanisms were discussed through proposing different types of carbon nanotube fracture modes along with fiber pulling out from epoxy composites. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

It can be concluded that increasing the short GF content increased the tensile and impact strengths of the specimens. Moreover, the surface treatment of glass fiber with silane coupling agent (SCA) and HTPB modification of epoxy improved the mech. properties because of the strong interaction between fibers, epoxy, and rubber. SEM studies showed that use of SCA improved interfacial bonding between the glass fibers and the epoxy matrix. Moreover, it was found that HTPB domains having relatively round shapes formed in the matrix. These rubber domains led to improved strength and toughness, due mainly to the &quot;rubber toughening&quot; effect in the brittle epoxy matrix. [on SciFinder(R)]",

Recent advances in the understanding of stem cell biology and mechanosensing have shed new light onto the importance of the local microenvironment in determining cell fate. Herein we report the biological properties of a bioactive, biodegradable calcium phosphate glass/polylactic acid composite biomaterial that promotes bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilisation, differentiation and angiogenesis through the creation of a controlled bone healing-like microenvironment. The angiogenic response is triggered by biochemical and mechanical cues provided by the composite, which activate two synergistic cell signalling pathways: a biochemical one mediated by the calcium-sensing receptor and a mechanosensitive one regulated by non-muscle myosin II contraction. Together, these signals promote a synergistic response by activating EPCs-mediated VEGF and VEGFR-2 synthesis, which in turn promote progenitor cell homing, differentiation and tubulogenesis. These findings highlight the importance of controlling microenvironmental cues for stem/progenitor cell tissue engineering and offer exciting new therapeutical opportunities for biomaterial-based vascularisation approaches and clinical applications.",

Four modified clasp arms were prepared by changing the width or thickness of the basic clasp (width/thickness: 2.60 mm/0.65 mm, 2.60 mm/1.95 mm, 1.30 mm/1.30 mm, and 3.90 mm/1.30 mm). Forced displacements of 5 mm in the removal direction were applied to the nodes at the base of the clasp arm. The retentive forces and maximum tensile stresses of the five FRC clasp arms ranged from 1.00-16.30 N and from 58.9-151 MPa, respectively.

In addition, the materials were analyzed for their micro-hardness and surface fiber exposure. The resistance to SCC of the ECR-glass/polymer composites was compared with that of the E-glass/polymer systems. It has been found that the ECR-glass fiber composites vastly out-perform their E-glass counterparts regarding their resistance to SCC in nitric acid.

Rectangular test specimens (n = 10 per group) were modified by incorporating an additional fiber reinforcement of untreated E-glass fibers, silanized E-glass fibers, or aramid fibers in the test specimens. Controls were either unreinforced or reinforced from the middle of the test specimen only. The impact strength of the specimens was measured by using a charpy-type pendulum impact tester after the specimens had been stored in water at 37 degrees C for 4 weeks. After the impact strength test, the length of the delamination of poly(methyl methacrylate) from the fibers was measured and plotted to the impact strength of the test specimens by using a linear regression model. The impact strength of unreinforced autopolymerizing poly(methyl methacrylate) was 7.8 kl/m2, while incorporation of glass fiber reinforcement with a fiber concentration of 12.4 wt% increased the impact strength to 74.7 kl/m2 (P = .000). The additional fiber reinforcement of the test specimen did not affect the impact strength (P = .363). Delamination negatively correlated with the impact strength of the test specimens (r = -.72, P = .000). The results of this study suggest that glass fiber reinforcement enhanced the impact strength of autopolymerizing poly(methyl methacrylate), while the use of additional fiber reinforcement made of aramid or glass fibers in the test specimens did not have an effect on the impact strength.",

          "abstract": "The dynamic mechanical properties of oil palm fiber reinforced phenol formaldehyde (PF) composites and oil palm/glass hybrid fiber reinforced PF composites were investigated as a function of fiber content and hybrid fiber ratio. The dynamic modulus of the neat PF sample decreases with decrease in frequency. Glass transition attributed with the a relaxation of the neat PF sample was observed around 140 degrees C. Tan delta values and storage modulus show great enhancement upon fiber addition. The value increases with increase in fiber content. The loss modulus shows a reverse trend with increase in fiber loading. Incorporation of oil palm fiber shifts the glass transition towards lower temperature value. The glass transition temperature of the hybrid composites is lower than that of the unhybridized composites. The highest value of mechanical damping is observed in hybrid composites. Storage modulus of the hybrid composites is lower than unhybridized oil palm fiber/PF composite. A similar trend is observed for loss modulus. Activation energies for the relaxation processes in different composites were calculated. Activation energy is increased upon fibrous reinforcement. Complex modulus variations and phase behavior of the composites were studied from ColeCole plots. Finally, master curves for the viscoelastic properties of the composites were constructed on the basis of time-temperature superposition principle. (c) 2005 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

The responses analyzed were the compressive modulus and strength. In addition, the foam size cell distribution was studied as a function of density. The results showed that the density and the morphology of composite foams exhibit a strong influence on the responses of the model.

We deposited multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) onto electrically insulating glass fibre surfaces leading to the formation of semiconductive MWCNT-glass fibres and in turn multifunctional fibre/polymer interphases. The deposition process of MWCNTs onto glass fibre surfaces involved both electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and conventional dip coating methods. The EPD coating method produces a more homogeneous and continuous nanotube distribution on the glass fibre surface compared with the dip coating. According to fragmentation test results, the interphase with a small number of heterogeneous MWCNTs in the EPD fibre/epoxy composites, mimicking a biological bone structure, can remarkably improve the interfacial shear strength. We found that the semiconductive interphase results in a high sensitivity of the electrical resistance to the tensile strain of single glass fibre model composites.

The ultimate lower limit of feature size and recent observation of interesting instability phenomenon in fiber system motivate us to examine fluid instabilities during the complicated thermal drawing fabrication processing. In this paper, from the perspective of a single instability mechanism, classical Plateau-Rayleigh instabilities in the form of radial fluctuation, we explore the stability of various microstructures (such as shells and filaments) in our composite fibers. The attained uniform structures are consistent with theoretical analysis. Furthermore, a viscous materials map is established from calculations and agrees well with various identified materials. These results not only shed insights into other forms of fluid instabilities, but also provide guidance to achieve more diverse nanostructures (such as filaments, wires, and particles) in the microstructured fibers.",

The results indicated that the overall, high-T rheologic response of the 2D composites was intermediate to the properties of 1D composites with fiber orientations corresponding to the constituent plies in the 2D material. This behavior strongly suggested that the 2D material behaved as an isostrain laminate during creep. A simple analysis, treating the 2D material as a three-phase laminate, where the constituent plies were assigned the viscoelastic properties of the corresponding 1D materials and separated by thin layers of unreinforced matrix, fit the experimental data. In the case of 2D composites with the plies misoriented at 20 and 70?? to the applied stress (20/-70?? composites), however, microstructural study suggested that growth of cracks in directions perpendicular to the applied stress due to the Poisson effect would have made a significant contribution to the bulk strain.

The reinforcing fibers can be evenly distributed in the denture base polymer or alternatively fiber-rich phase in the denture base polymer can form a separate structure. The aim of this study was to determinate static three-point flexural strength and modulus of denture base polymer that had been reinforced with different fiber reinforcements. METHODS: The test specimens (3 x 5 x 50 mm) were made of auto-polymerized denture base polymer and reinforced with different fiber reinforcements. The test groups were: (A) no fibers; (B) non-impregnated polyethylene fibers; (C) light-polymerized monomer impregnated glass fibers; (D) porous polymer preimpregnated glass fibers and (E) light-polymerized monomer-polymer impregnated glass fibers. The fibers were oriented parallel to the long axis of the specimen and embedded into the denture base resin on the compression side (n=7) or tension side (n=7). Dry specimens were tested with three-point static flexural strength test set-up at crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. RESULTS: The statistical analysis by two-way analysis of variance showed that the brand and the location of the fiber reinforcements significantly influenced the flexural strength (p&lt;0.0001). However, the location of the fiber reinforcements did not influence the flexural modulus (p&lt;0.722). SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that impregnated and preimpregnated fibers reinforce denture base polymer more than non-impregnated fibers. Fiber reinforcements placed on the tensile side resulted in considerably higher flexural strength and flexural modulus values compared with same quantity of fibers placed on the compression side.",

To evaluate the efficacy on flexural properties of flowable dental resin compositereinforced with short glass fiber of different aspect ratios (ARs) and volume percent load-ings. It is hypothesized that with the addition of randomly oriented fibers it is possible tosignificantly improve flexural strength and modulus while maintaining flowability.
Methods. Ten groups of samples with varying glass fiber volume loads (0, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%and 60%) and three different ARs (5.2, 68 and 640) were tested in three point bending tofracture according to ISO 4049. A flowable resin composite was used as the control and alsoas the filled resin composite that was subsequently reinforced with fibers. Load deflectionresults were used to calculate flexural strength and flexural modulus. SEM images wereused to determine the mode(s) of failure, to describe surface features of reinforcement andwere correlated with force displacement graphs. All results were statistically analysed usingANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey&#039;s test. Level of significance was set at 0.05.
Results. When compared to the &quot;sculptable&quot; control (68.6 vol% filler loaded) results for flex-ural strength varied from a mean reduction of 42% (p &gt; 0.05) for the low AR group to anincrease of 77% (p &lt; 0.001) for the high AR samples. Flexural modulus results varied from alow of 6.6 [0.67] GPa for the non reinforced spatulated control to 20.3 [1.31] GPa (p &lt; 0.001) forthe 60% loaded low AR group. The low fiber loaded mid AR group was still flowable with 49%total loading (5% fiber/44% filler) but gave strength values (181.2 [33.5] MPa) 30% higher thanthe &quot;sculptable&quot; control (p &gt; 0.05) and comparable modulus.
Significance. This study shows that short and very short glass fibers can significantly reinforceflowable dental composite. The fiber&#039;s aspect ratio was shown to be more important than vol-ume loading for flexural strength. It appears possible to produce a light cured short glass fiberreinforced flowable material with superior flexural properties compared to conventionaluniversal composites.",

          "abstract": "PAN/SWNT composite fibers have been spun with 0, 5, and 10 wt% single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Tensile fracture surfaces of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers exhibited extensive fibrillation, while for PAN/SWNT composite fibers, tendency to fibrillate decreased with increasing SWNT content. The reinforcing effect of SWNTs on the oxidized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber has been studied. At 10wt% SWNTs, breaking strength, modulus, and strain to failure of the oxidized composite fiber increased by 100%, 160%, and 115%, respectively. Tensile fracture surfaces of thermally stabilized PAN and the PAN/SWNT fibers exhibited brittle behavior and well distributed SWNT ropes covered with the oxidized matrix can be observed in the tensile fracture surfaces of the fibers. No de-bonding has been observed between unoxidized or the oxidized PAN matrix and the nanotube ropes. Higher strain to failure of the oxidized composite fiber as compared to that of the oxidized control PAN fiber also suggests good adhesion/ interaction between SWNT and the oxidized matrix. Thermal stresses generated on the composite fiber during the oxidation process were lower than those for the control fiber. The potential of PAN/SWNT composite fiber as the precursor material for the carbon fiber has been discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The fluorescence response of the dansyl chromophore has been used to study the kinetic of epoxy curing processes. With this new method, comparison between the curing at the interface of a glass fiber/epoxy and in the epoxy bulk of a composite material was studied. The effect of two glass fiber surface treatments was investigated. Commercial E-glass fibers were surface coated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and 3-aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane (APDES). Fluorimetry (using fluorescent labels) and FT-NIR (Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy in the near range) techniques were used to monitor the curing process in these composite materials. From the analysis of the data obtained, different simple kinetic models were discussed and apparent activation energies were obtained. Furthermore, from those techniques the respective results were compared to obtain complementary information. Independently of the sample and the technique used for the kinetic analysis, no variation of the activation energy of the epoxy curing reaction was found, which suggests that there are no changes in the mechanism of the reaction along the process. Fluorescence from dansyl located at the glass fiber/epoxy interface reflected that the kind of reinforcement treatment clearly affects the epoxy curing process exactly in that region. However, when analytical response comes from the whole system the mechanism of the reaction does not seem to change with the silane coating used although is quite different in comparison with the process at the interface. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The process makes it possible to expand and reconsolidate the fibers of rovings by passing them into the impregnation die filled with molten thermoplastic. The die consists of three rollers and numerous pins fixed on the roller surfaces over which the roving is drawn under tension. The material chosen to illustrate the die process is a glass-fiber reinforced nylon-6, PA6. The void content and mechanical properties were measured to investigate the influence of processing variables on properties. These process experiences indicated that poor fiber resin impregnation and fiber damage, due to harsh prepreg fabrication, result in low values for longitudinal tensile strength and impact properties. However, the composites manufactured by this technique show a significant improvement in mechanical properties over conventionally prepared thermoplastic composites.",

          "abstract": "Measured elasticity moduli of a highly (68%) glass-fiber reinforced epoxy matrix for different amounts of fiber/matrix interface weakening and debonding, due to different hygrothermal ageing stages, are compared to estimated ones. Ultrasonic measurements provide seven of the nine elasticity moduli of the orthotropic material samples, including all the moduli significantly affected by damage. Theoretical estimates combine homogenization modeling techniques and Finite Element (FE) calculations, the latter when the effect of observed partial debonding on effective moduli is to be specified. These estimates are performed under different assumptions for the composite structure, with special attention to the existence of a fiber-matrix interphase. Analytical comparisons for the undamaged composite establish that matching US measurements with estimates cannot be obtained, regardless of the chosen model, without the assumption of an interphase layer of modified resin coating the fibers. This coating resin, when in relevant concentration with regard to literature data about fiber coating thickness, typically conserves the epoxy moduli transversally to the fiber orientation, while, in the fiber direction its moduli approach those of the fibers. The comparison of the US measurements on damaged samples to FE calculations assuming progressive one-directional debonding shows that most of the composite stiffness loss can preferentially be due to an initial interphase weakening, while the fiber/matrix debonding seems more likely delayed to long H-ageing times. This is consistent with physical interpretation of damage by water pooling through silane bridges bonding epoxy to glass. The calculations also provide the effective stiffness, at different damage stages, of the &quot;Undamaged Equivalent Inhomogeneity&quot; for this damaged inclusion type. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For these experimental studies the carbon fiber reinforced epoxy laminates were fabricated using a heated vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (H-VARTM®) method followed by a 2 soak curing cycle. The f-CNTs toughened the epoxy resin-fiber interfaces to mitigate the evolution of fiber/fabric-matrix interfacial cracking and delamination under both static and cyclic loadings.

The composite disc is cut out of pultruded plates, revealing a specific structure. The classical laws of fiber orientation and their relation to friction can be proven in one single test, while the development of a thin film layer lowers the overall coefficient of friction, with almost 20%. Further on there is a clear relation between the coefficient of friction and the material structure. Also the importance of the fiber orientation and the relation to the wear of the pin sample are clearly shown. The experimental results have shown that there is an existence of noticeable features on the worn surfaces.

It is found that the fatigue life of the composite increases with increasing the volume fraction of tungsten fibers. Similar to crystalline metals, the regions of crack initiation, propagation and overload fracture can be discerned on the fracture surface of the specimen. Fatigue crack normally initiates in the metallic glass matrix at the outer surface of the composite specimen and propagates predominantly in the matrix. Different crack front profile around the tungsten fibers and fiber pullout demonstrate that fatigue crack may propagate around the fiber, leading to bridging of the crack faces by the unbroken fiber and hence improved fatigue crack-growth resistance. Locally decreased effective stiffness in the region where fiber distribution is sparse may provide preferential crack path in the composite. A proposed model was exercised to elucidate different tungsten fiber fracture morphologies in the fatigue crack propagation and overload fracture regions in the light of Poisson&#039;s ratio effect during fatigue loading. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

The relative rates of these degradation processes are a function of the chemistry of the resin, temperature, length of time of exposure, degree of stress (whether cyclic or static), chemistry and morphology of coating of coupling agent on the glass fiber, and type of glass fiber. Several examples illustrate how the chemistry and morphology of the coatings of coupling agents that are on the glass fiber influence the strength and durability of the interfacial region. © 1994.",

Four groups of porous {FRC} specimens were prepared with a different amount of resin matrix. Control group contained specimens of fibers, which were bound together with sizing only. Microstructure of the specimens was analyzed using a micro computed tomography (micro-{CT)} based method. Mechanical properties of the specimens were measured with a tensile test. The amount of resin matrix in the specimens had an effect on the microstructure. Total porosity was 59.5 % (median) in the group with the lowest resin content and 11.2 % (median) in the group with the highest resin content. In control group, total porosity was 94.2 % (median). Correlations with resin content were obtained for all micro-{CT} based parameters except {TbPf.} The tensile strength of the composites was 21.3 {MPa} (median) in the group with the highest resin content and 43.4 {MPa} (median) in the group with the highest resin content. The tensile strength in control group was 18.9 {MPa} (median). There were strong correlations between the tensile strength of the specimens and most of the micro-{CT} based parameters.

The TRBF are source functions having their source points outside the domain. Special attention will be given to the application of the TRBF in the form of dipoles to the simulation of composites reinforced by fibres of finite length with large aspect ratio. In linear problems, only nodes on the domain boundaries and a set of source functions in points outside the domain are necessary to satisfy boundary conditions. Finally we will show MCSF to modelling of reinforced composites with glass fiber and epoxy matrix.

However, long-term clinical data are scarce. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the survival of 3 different GFRP systems, taking into account several other relevant factors. Methods: One-hundred forty-nine GFRPs in 122 patients were followed for up to 120 months. GFRPs were adhesively luted using the etch-and-rinse technique. The core was built with a chemically curing composite resin and restored according to the specific prosthetic treatment plan. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between clinical variables and the time until failure. Results: Within 10 years, 55 failures could be observed (annual failure rate = 4.6%) with the most frequent ones being post fracture, loss of post retention (both n = 17), endodontic problems (n = 7), and those resulting in tooth extraction (n = 10). Sixty posts could be followed up for 105 to 120 months (34 posts lost to follow-up, [mean (standard deviation) survival time: 74 (43) months]). In crude analyses, only the tooth type in favor of posterior teeth compared with anterior teeth and the number of remaining cavity walls (in favor of ???1compared with no wall) were significantly associated with the failure rate. Cox regression analysis revealed a significant hazard ratio of 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.5; P =.021) for tooth type in favor of posterior teeth. Conclusions: The relatively high annual failure rate of GFRPs highlights that the treatment decision should take into account the most relevant factors as tooth type and the number of remaining cavity walls. ?? 2012 American Association of Endodontists.",

          "abstract": "Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites were modified through introduction of ion-exchangers in order to enhance their longevity in the alkaline environment of concrete. Glass fiber composites offer a desired balance of performance and cost for replacement of corrosion-prone steel reinforcement in concrete; their rapid deterioration in the alkaline environment of concrete is, however, a major drawback. Ion exchangers are insoluble solids carrying cations (or anions) which can be exchanged with ions of the same sign. Cation exchangers of hydrogen form replace alkali metal cations (e.g., K+ in alkaline solutions diffusing into the polymer matrix) with H+. This exchange of cations neutralizes aggressive alkaline solutions by converting K+ OH- (and Na+ OH-, etc.) into H2O. Fine weak-acid cation exchangers, when introduced as coating on glass fiber composite bars (applied immediately after pultrusion and before curing of polymer matrix) proved to be compatible with the industrial-scale pultrusion process of composite bars without any need to modify the curing process. Thorough laboratory investigations and industrial-scale pultrusion efforts, were undertaken, which successfully demonstrated that introduction of selected ion exchangers into the polymer matrix (or a surface layer of matrix) does not interfere with the pultrusion process, and yields significant gains in the alkali resistance of glass fiber composites. The durability characteristics of glass fiber composite bars modified with weak-acid cation exchanger coating were investigated under two different accelerated aging conditions. The modified composite bars provided desirable durability attributes under these two different accelerated aging effects, including exposure to the alkaline pore solution of concrete and salt solution. The mechanical characteristics of modified glass fiber composite bars (with weak-acid cation exchanger coating) were investigated by conducting compression, flexure, and shear tests. The results indicated that the modification of pultruded bars did not alter their mechanical performance. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) composite materials are finding increased application in many engineering fields. Machining of these materials cannot be avoided to get accuracy and precision fits. Among the various machining processes used, drilling is one of the most important processes and is mainly used in joining of composite structures. A major problem which encountered in drilling of GFRP composite laminate is damage or delamination. The damage due to thrust force is the important concern in drilling, and it leads to poor machinability. In the present work, prediction of thrust force in drilling of composite materials is carried out using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy rule-based model is developed to predict the thrust force in drilling of GFRP composites. The effectiveness of the fuzzy model was compared with the response surface model. Good agreement is observed between the predictive model values and experimental values. The analysis of machining parameters on drilling is carried out using Pareto analysis of variance (Pareto-ANOVA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA).",

          "abstract": "Conventional and hybrid micro-composites consisting of up to nine single fibers in Epon 828/Versamid 140 epoxy were constructed and pulled in uniaxial tension. The coordination of fiber fractures for each system was studied as a function of interfiber spacing. E-glass, AS-4 and IM6-G carbon, and Kevlar-49 fibers were used. It was shown that fiber fracture occurred in a random pattern when fiber spacing was more than eight fiber diameters. When the fiber spacing was less than eight fiber diameters there was coordination of fractures in adjacent fibers, with increased adhesion resulting in stronger coordination. The AS-4/Kevlar-49 hybrid system exhibited the least amount of coordinated fracture. A computer model of the hybrid effect, based on local load sharing principles, predicted similar strength enhancement of the stiffer fibers in hybrid composites as other authors have found experimentally. It was concluded that the hybrid effect can be attributed to load sharing between high and low modulus fibers in hybrid composites. © 1994.",

Analysis of the toughening process showed them to be: (i) matrix crack bowing before the crack front approaches the fiber, (ii) fiber bridging with the interfacial sliding after the crack front has completely passed the fiber. The increase of the measured stress intensity factor was explained by a crack bowing model and fiber point bridging model that included the effect of a finite specimen size.

The effect of temperature on the storage modulus (E-&#039;), loss modulus (E-&#039;&#039;), and loss factor or damping efficiency (tan delta) is determined. All the properties are compared with those of the neat polyester samples and the un-hybridized composites. The effects of the layering pattern of the two fibers on the ultimate viscoelastic behavior of the composites are also investigated. Composites are prepared with banana as the surface layer and glass as the surface layer and also as an intimate mixture of glass and banana. At temperatures above T-g, the storage modulus values are found to decrease even with the addition of glass fiber for the geometry where glass is the core material. The value of the storage modulus of the composites with the above mentioned geometry is found to be different, above and below T-g, the value above T-g being lower than that below T-g unlike in unhybridized composite. The loss modulus curves and the damping peaks are found to be flattened by the addition of glass. Layering pattern or the geometry of the composites is found to have a profound effect on the dynamic properties of the composite. An intimately mixed composite is found to have the highest storage modulus values in all compositions. The values are consistent with the results of tensile strength. The tan delta curve is found to be affected by the layering pattern followed and gives insight into the interaction in the material. The dielectric behavior of the composites are also found to be dependent on the glass fiber volume fraction as well as the layering pattern employed.",

The radial spread of damage was smallest for the 2D laminates and largest for the 3D woven composites. The 3D composites had the greatest resistance to penetration and dissipated more total energy than the other systems. This is due to unique energy absorption mechanisms, which involve the crimped portion of z-tows in the 3D composites, and implies that failure can be controlled by manipulation of the properties of the z-tows.

Heretofore, most studies have focused on basic material properties such as the piezoelectric properties of unidirectional glass fiber epoxy composites with respect to the fiber orientation or the loading speed. In this study, the effect of the crack length on the piezoelectric damage monitoring of glass fiber polymer composites was experimentally investigated. Dynamic tests of mode I were performed using double-cantilever-beam (DCB) specimens, and the relationship between the crack length and the electric-charge signals measured from the electrodes on the DCB specimens was analyzed. The experiment results showed that the magnitude of the electric-charge signals increased very slowly as the crack tip approached the electrodes, rose sharply when the crack tip was passing through the electrodes, and then decreased fast and maintained relatively very low values when the crack tip had completely passed through the electrodes. The investigation of the mechanical behaviors via finite-element analyses during the dynamic tests revealed that the tendency of electric-charge signals is quite similar to that of the strain changes in glass fiber epoxy composites near electrodes. Based on the results of the experiments and finite-element analyses conducted in this study, it was concluded that piezoelectric damage monitoring can detect crack propagation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The model takes into account the random nature of both liber and oz interfacial strengths. The Monte Carlo technique has been chosen for computational realization, and the interface is assumed to be elasto-plastic. lit contrast with existing solutions, which use a random generation of flaw locations (or fragment lengths), the present approach is based on the generation of random fibre and interfacial strengths along the fiber and interface, respectively. Numerical calculations of the fragment length distributions are presented as functions of the statistical characteristics of the fiber and interfacial Abstract strengths. A significant influence of the fiber strength variability on the distribution and the average value of fragment lengths is shown. In general, the variability of the interfacial strength affects the fragment length distribution as well. A strategy for the measurement and calculation of the interfacial strength distribution from the single-fiber fragmentation test is presented. The strategy is illustrated by using a series of single-fiber glass glass/epoxy composites with five different fiber surface treatments. Statistical parameters for the interfacial strength are evaluated by rising a set of dimensionless graphs and tables. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.",

          "abstract": "The tensile failure mechanisms and the effects of manufacture flaws on the tensile behavior of an unidirectional composite (E-glass fiber/epoxy matrix) were investigated.  Macroscopic failure processes were determined by an enhanced X-ray radiography technique and microstructural changes analysed by both optical and scanning electron microscopy.  An axisymmetric finite element model was developed for analysing the microstress distributions in the composite containing broken fibers in order to determine the effect of local fiber volume fraction on the local failure process.  Finally, the measurement of the volume fraction distribution of fiber misalignment was carried out and a simple analytical model was proposed to interpret the fiber misalignment effect.  A correlation between the fiber misalignment distribution in the specimens and their tensile strengths was obtained statistically.",

          "abstract": "Dietary fiber has emerged in the past decade as a factor in nutrition that appears to have complex physiological and clinical implications. A great deal of research has focused on its effect on colorectal diseases. Some human epidemiological studies on colon cancer point to a possible preventive role of dietary fiber, but the results are confounded by the difference in the intake of many other food substances such as fat and the overall differences in the dietary pattern of the populations investigated. Animal studies using chemical carcinogens, such as 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, have lent support to a protective role of certain components of fiber, such as purified cellulose. Other fiber polymers, such as pectin, have not shown any protective effect. Perhaps the strongest evidence for a protective role of fiber in the colon comes from studies relating low dietary fiber intake to the higher incidence of diverticular disease of the colon; addition of dietary fiber to the diet of patients with symptomatic diverticular disease seems to relieve pain effectively. Recently, some preliminary studies have shown the possible correlation of low dietary fiber intake with a greater incidence of ulcerative colitis and Crohn&#039;s disease, but these studies are too limited in number and scope to allow any conclusion to be reached at this time.",

The aims of this study were to optimize the processing parameters and fiber size of TPU/KF composite. The method used to develop this composite consisted of two main steps. First, the influence of processing parameters such as temperature, time, and speed on tensile properties was studied. Second, effects of different fiber size on tensile properties, flexural properties, and impact strength were tested. The optimum blending parameters were 190°C, 11 min, and 40 rpm for temperature, time and speed, respectively. TPU/KF composites with different fiber sizes were prepared, namely, &lt;125, 125-300, and 300-425 µm. Tensile and flexural strength and modulus were best for fiber size range between 125 and 300 µm.

Two GRP architectures are investigated—S2 glass woven roving in Cycom 4102 polyester resin matrix and a balanced 5-harness satin weave E-glass in a Ciba epoxy (LY564) matrix. The GRP specimens were shock loaded using an 82.5mm bore single-stage gas-gun. A velocity interferometer was used to measure the particle velocity profile at the rear (free) surface of the target plate. The spall strength of the GRP was obtained as a function of the normal component of the impact stress and the applied shear-strain by subjecting the GRP specimens to normal shock compression and combined shock compression and shear loading, respectively. The spall strengths of the two GRP composites were observed to decrease with increasing levels of normal shock compression. Moreover, superposition of shear-strain on the normal shock compression was found to be highly detrimental to the spall strength. The E-glass reinforced GRP composite was found to have a much higher level of spall strength under both normal shock compression and combined compression and shear loading when compared to the S2-glass GRP composite. The maximum spall strength of the E-glass GRP composite was found to be 119.5MPa, while the maximum spall strength for the S2 glass GRP composite was only 53.7MPa. These relatively low spall strength levels of the S2-glass and the E-glass fiber reinforced composites have important implications to the design and development of GRP-based light-weight integral armor.",

Three different FRC implant types were manufactured for the study: non-threaded implants with a BAG coating; threaded implants with a BAG coating; and threaded implants with a grit-blasted surface. Thirty-six implants (six implants for each group per time point) were installed in the tibiae of six pigs. After an implantation period of 4 and 12 wk, the implants were retrieved and prepared for micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), push-out testing, and scanning electron microscopy analysis. Micro-CT demonstrated that the screw-threads and implant structure remained undamaged during the installation. The threaded FRC/BAG implants had the highest bone volume after 12 wk of implantation. The push-out strengths of the threaded FRC/BAG implants after 4 and 12 wk (463 degrees N and 676 degrees N, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the threaded FRC implants (416 degrees N and 549 degrees N, respectively) and the nonthreaded FRC/BAG implants (219 degrees N and 430 degrees N, respectively). Statistically significant correlation was found between bone volume and push-out strength values. This study showed that osseointegrated FRC implants can withstand the static loading up to failure without fracture, and that the addition of BAG significantly improves the push-out strength of FRC implants.",

In addition to the primary requirements of stiffness, strength, and ease of processing, wind blade materials must withstand severe fatigue loading under service environments. The large material volumes and cost constraints also lead to unusually thick plies and fabrics, as well as thick adhesive bonds, which, combined with relatively brittle, low cost resins, can exacerbate delamination related structural integrity issues found in most composites structures. Important differences in performance are shown for the major fiber and resin types of relevance to blades. Details of fabric construction, fiber content and ply drop and geometry can produce major differences in performance, particularly under fatigue loading. Materials and conditions are identified where particularly low strain damage failure can occur at high cycles.",

The changes in mechanical and chemical properties were systematically characterized over 52 weeks dissolution time to determine the degradation mechanism and investigate strength retention by the bioresorbable glass fiber-reinforced PLDLA composite. The degradation mechanism was found to be a combination of surface and bulk erosion and does not follow the typical core-accelerated degradation mechanism of poly(α-hydroxyacids) . Strength retention by bioresorbable glass fiber-reinforced PLDLA composites can be tailored by changing the oxide composition of the glass fibers, but the structure-property relationship of the glass fibers has to be understood and controlled so that the phenomenon of ion leaching can be utilized to control the degradation rate. Therefore, these high performance composites are likely to open up several new possibilities for utilizing resorbable materials in clinical applications which could not be realized in the past. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

The test technique, originally developed for testing of steel specimens, is presented in its basic aspects; reported are the conventional procedures for determining load, displacement and energy absorption that a specimen experiences, over the entire phase of loading and subsequent failure of the specimen. Techniques are described for generating data of sufficient accuracy when applying the test to composites. In particular, the necessity of utilizing measurement chains of sufficiently high frequency response and striker tups of sufficiently high sensitivity is emphasized. Tests are performed with glass-fiber/vinyl-ester specimens, provided with notches oriented in two different directions with respect to the plies of woven glass fiber rovings. Two different types of failure result: fiber breakage ahead of the notch due to tensile stresses, and delaminations of the interface planes between the plies of woven glass fiber rovings due to shear stresses. Specifically, energies absorbed by the specimen over the entire failure process and values of maximum load occurring during the impact process are measured over a large range of temperatures. The data are correlated with the observed failure phenomena. The high level of information obtained in characterizing the failure behaviour by means of a test which requires limited technical effort proves the instrumented Charpy impact test to be a simple but effective tool for quantifying the quality of a composite in practical applications, as e.g. in surveillance programs for controlling processes such as manufacturing or aging of the material.",

The degree of adhesion between the composite plies and the aluminum was characterized by conducting single cantilever beam tests. Here, it was found that the composites could be successfully bonded to the aluminum using a simple short stamping procedure. A detailed examination of the fracture surfaces indicated that crack propagation occurred within the composite ply in the fiber-metal laminates and along the composite-aluminum foam interface in the sandwich structures. The low velocity impact response of the FMLs and the sandwich structures was investigated using an instrumented drop-weight impact tower and a laser-Doppler velocimeter. The energy absorption characteristics of the sandwich structures were investigated along with the failure processes. Finally, a series of tensile tests on the damaged FMLs and thermoplastic sandwich structures showed that both systems offer promising residual load-bearing properties. Here, shear failure in the aluminum foam was observed in the sandwich structures, indicative of a strong bond between the FML skins and the aluminum core. (C) 2004 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

The composite contained Si-Ti-C-O fibers with an additional surface modification in order to improve interface properties. Although a significant decrease in tensile strength was observed in the unsealed composite beyond 1000 degrees C in air (and attributed to oxidation of the fiber/matrix interface), the composite with glass sealant possessed excellent mechanical properties for short-term (&lt; 1 hr.) exposure in air. In this study, tensile creep testing was conducted at 1100-1300 degrees C in air and the effect of glass sealant on medium- and long-term strength was investigated. In addition, chemical stability of the glass sealant was evaluated by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS).

A 3-point bend test using INSTRON-1195 is carried out to estimate inter laminar shear strength (ILSS) values of the shock treated and untreated samples (after hygrothermal exposure) separately. Low temperature DSC is carried out to record the deviation in Tg, the glass transition temperature. Hygrothermal conditioning without thermal shock reveals a general trend of lowering of ILSS values with varied exposure times. Up and down-thermal shocks are seen to affect the ILSS values differently, the lowest Tg being recorded for samples exposed to up-thermal shock after hygrothermal conditioning. Scanning electron micrographs reveal the mode of failure which includes fiber fragmentation, fiber pull-out and fiber matrix debonding.",

Hybrid natural fiber composites, a sector of natural composites meets these requirements. This paper deals with fabrication, mechanical characterization of a hybrid (Jute+Flax+GFRP) composite and also the comparison of it with the (Jute+GFRP) based composite. These composites are fabricated using hand lay-up technique. The arrangement of hybrid composite is such that a layer of vertically laid flax fiber is flanked between layers of horizontally laid jute fiber. Epoxy resin alongside with HY951 hardener is used as the binding agent throughout the layer. Glass fiber laminates are used on both sides for improving the surface finish and surface hardness. The volumetric fraction is such that one third of total volume is occupied by Jute and Flax fibers. Test results shows that the hybrid natural composite has excellent properties under tensile, flexural loading. At last failure morphology analysis is done using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the internal structure of the broken specimen is discussed. © 2014 The Korean Fiber Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",

In this work, three-dimensional (3-D) carbon fiber fabric is used to reinforce hydroxyapatite (HA)/thermosetting epoxy composite and epoxy resin through resin transfer molding (RTM) processing. It is found that the 3-D carbon fiber fabric can be impregnated with epoxy and HA-containing epoxy resin, and HA is distributed gradually along the depth direction in fiber-reinforced HA/epoxy composite, although HA is dispersed evenly in epoxy resin by surface modification of silane coupling agent. The impact toughness and flexural strength of fiber-reinforced epoxy and fiber-reinforced HA/epoxy composites are much higher than those of epoxy and HA/epoxy composite. The impact toughness of both fiber-reinforced composites decreases while the flexural strength and the flexural modulus increase with fiber volume ratio. The impact toughness of the fiber-reinforced HA/epoxy composite is higher, while the flexural strength and modulus are lower than those of the fiber-reinforced epoxy composite at the same fiber volume ratio. The flexural strength of the both composites is higher than, and their flexural modulus is close to, those of the human cortical bone. The in vitro cytotoxicity test with L929 fibroblasts shows that the addition of HA diminished the toxicity of epoxy resin. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

It ensures that the complete cross-linking takes place to produce the targeted properties of composites. In this work infrared radiation (IR) post curing process for glass fiber reinforced polymer composite laminates is studied as an alternative to conventional thermal cure. Distance from the IR source, curing schedule and volume of the composite were selected as the IR cure parameters for optimization. Design of experiments (DOE) approach was adopted for conducting the experiments. Tensile strength and flexural strength of the composite laminate were the responses measured to select the final cure parameters. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), surface plots and contour plots clearly demonstrate that the distance from the IR source and volume of the composite contribute nearly 70% to the response functions. This establishes that polymer composites cured using IR technique can achieve the same properties using only 25% of the total time compared to that of conventional thermal curing. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

There is a lack of data regarding the clinical usefulness of such prostheses. PURPOSE: The clinical performance of 31 resin-bonded, glass fiber-reinforced composite fixed partial dentures was evaluated in a preliminary study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prostheses were made to replace 1 to 3 missing maxillary or mandibular teeth in each of 31 patients. The prostheses had a framework made of continuous unidirectional E-glass fibers with multiphase polymer matrix and light-polymerized particulate composite resin veneering. The prostheses were examined after 6-month periods for up to 24 months (mean follow-up time was 14 months). Partial or total debonding of the prostheses or the framework fracture was considered a treatment failure. RESULTS: Two prostheses debonded during the follow-up period; 1 debonding was related to improper occlusal adjustment and the other to unknown reasons. Kaplan-Meier survival probability at 24 months was 93%. No framework fractures were observed. CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary study suggest that the resin-bonded, glass fiber-reinforced FPDs may be an alternative for resin-bonded FPDs with a cast metal framework.",

Fiber volume fractions were increased linearly from 0% in the compression zone to 2% in the tensile zone so that more fibers were available to carry tensile stress in a bending beam experiment. Extrusion was used to produce single homogeneous layers of constant fiber volume fraction and highly oriented fibers. The FRCC layers with different fiber volume fractions were stacked according to the desired configuration and then pressed to produce an integrated FGFRCC. Polished cross-sections of the FGFRCC were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to measure the fiber distribution. Flexural tests were carried out to characterize the mechanical behavior and to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed fiber distribution. No delamination between layers was observed in the fractured specimens. Compared to homogeneous FRCC with the same overall fiber volume fraction, the FGFRCC exhibited about 50% higher strength and comparable work of fracture. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The main goal of the transparent structural solutions presented here is to increase the post-cracking residual strength and ductility of glass by using GFRP strengthening laminates. The experimental programme included (i) tensile tests on double lap joints between glass and GFRP pultruded laminates, bonded with different types of structural adhesives, and (ii) full-scale flexural tests on glass beams and glass-GFRP composite beams, with different strengthening geometries and structural adhesives. Results obtained in this study show that, unlike glass beams, in glass-GFRP composite beams it is possible to obtain relatively ductile failure modes, with a significant increase of both strength and deformation capacity after the initial cracking of glass. The stiffness of the structural adhesive used, together with the geometry of the GFRP strengthening element, have a major influence on the structural response of the composite beams. Finite element models were developed for all tested beams, allowing to simulate their serviceability behaviour (prior to glass cracking) with fairly good accuracy, namely in what concerns the degree of shear interaction at the bonded interfaces. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Further areas of investigation include the effect of fiber length, talc particle size and talc surface treatment. The so-called RADLITE process is employed on a laboratory scale to prepare composite sheets. Since the sheets show a preferred fiber orientation, testing was carried out in two directions, parallel and transverse to the direction of preferred fiber orientation (MFD and TFD). The fiber loading clearly dominates the composite performance and has a pronounced positive effect on it. Increasing the talc loading reduces strength. Under certain conditions, talc can be as efficient as glass fibers in increasing the composite modulus. Higher talc loadings do not impair the composite impact properties. A reduction in fiber length from 12??7 to 6??4mm causes improved properties in the MFD, which may be explained by a higher degree of fiber orientation. No significant effect of the talc particle size can be established as a result of measuring the variable over too narrow a range. A talc surface treatment does not result in improved composite performance. ?? 1993.",

The model accounts for distributions of orientation and length of elastic fibers embedded in a thermoplastic matrix whose behavior is elastic-plastic and damageable. The elastic-plastic damage behavior of the matrix is described by the modified Ramberg–Osgood relation and the 3D damage model in deformation assuming isotropic hardening. Fiber/matrix debonding is accounted for using a parameter that governs the fiber/matrix interface compliance. A linear relationship between this parameter and the matrix damage variable is assumed. First, the elastic-plastic damage behavior of the reference aligned fiber composite containing the same fiber volume fraction and length distribution as the actual composite is computed using an incremental Eshelby–Mori–Tanaka mean field approach. The incremental response of the latter is then obtained from the solution for the aligned-fiber composite by averaging over all fiber orientations. The model is validated against the experimental stress–strain results obtained for long-glass-fiber/polypropylene specimens.",

          "abstract": "Many recent activities in the use of one-dimensional nanostructures as photonic elements for optical information processing are explained by huge advantages that photonic circuits possess over traditional silicon-based electronic ones in bandwidth, heat dissipation, and resistance to electromagnetic wave interference. Organic materials are a promising candidate to support these optical-related applications, as they combine the properties of plastics with broad spectral tunability, high optical cross-section, easy fabrication, as well as low cost. Their outstanding compatibility allows organic composite structures which are made of two or more kinds of materials combined together, showing great superiority to single-component materials due to the introduced interactions among multiple constituents, such as energy transfer, electron transfer, exciton coupling, etc. The easy processability of organic 1D crystalline heterostructures enables a fine topological control of both composition and geometry, which offsets the intrinsic deficiencies of individual material. At the same time, the strong exciton-photon coupling and exciton-exciton interaction impart the excellent confinement of photons in organic microstructures, thus light can be manipulated according to our intention to realize specific functions. These collective properties indicate a potential utility of organic heterogeneous material for miniaturized photonic circuitry. Herein, focus is given on recent advances of 1D organic crystalline heterostructures, with special emphasis on the novel design, controllable construction, diverse performance, as well as wide applications in isolated photonic elements for integration. It is proposed that the highly coupled, hybrid optical networks would be an important material basis towards the creation of on-chip optical information processing.",

High expectations regarding esthetics by the patient were successfully met by utilizing a glass fiber reinforced composite temporary removable partial denture. Restoration remained intact, with no discoloration or deterioration at 12 months recall.",

          "abstract": "Binary composite materials comprising of randomly oriented E-glass fiber of four different weight percentages impregnated with epoxy resin are fabricated to study their physical, mechanical and thermal properties. The experimental results are used for the validation of the results obtained by simulation using ANSYS software. The finite element (FE) model based on representative area element (RAE) approach is implemented in the finite element code ANSYS. The comparative analysis gives an acceptable error, indicating applicability of such simulation model studies in predicting material characteristics in advance. The elastic modulus evaluated both by Halpin-Tsai model and FE model are more close to experimental results as compared to the results obtained from rule-of-mixture. Similarly, the tensile strength of the composites evaluated both experimentally and by finite element method (FEM) shows close resemblance. An empirical relationship has been developed and reported for the calculation of effective thermal conductivity for two-phase composite system (i.e. fiber and matrix interface). It is observed that the order of composites with effective thermal conductivity is 45 wt.% glass fiber based composite &gt;35 wt.% glass fiber based composite &gt;25 wt.% glass fiber based composite &gt;15 wt.% glass fiber based composite. The magnitude increases slightly in case of 45 wt.% glass fiber based composite, whereas it remains almost constant in case of 35 wt.% and shows slightly decrease in case of 25 wt.% and 15 wt.% glass fiber based composites. This facilitates designing/tailoring of composite materials as per structural requirements in the preliminary stages of R&amp;D more economically. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The effects of applied load and sliding time on the friction coefficient and wear loss of the GF/PEEK were examined. The mechanical property, morphology and thermal performance of the composite were studied. The results indicated that the friction coefficient and wear loss of the composite increased gradually and tended to be a stable state as the increase of applied load and sliding time. The GF/PEEK has an excellent wear resistance, compared with PEEK. The SEM and EDS indicated that the short glass-fibers were extruded from the composite rather than pulverized into the composite. Compared with that of pure PEEK, the thermal decomposition temperature of GF/PEEK composite had an increase of 75°C.

The modified glass material with more hydrophobic and rougher surface was characterized by FTIR, SEM, XPS, peeling experiments, and water/air contact angle. It was found that heat treatment at 140 approximate to 150 degrees C was able to improve the interaction between BC and glass material owing to the increase in chemical bonds between them. The biological modified glass fibers were compounded with epoxy resin. The influence of incubation time and high temperature on the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) between glass fibers and epoxy resin was identified by Microbond Test. The strongest IFSS could be obtained with incubation time of 1 hour and temperature of 140 degrees C, which then offers a biological approach to improve the interface of silicates materials and resin matrix.",

Ninety-one patients met the selection criteria and were randomized and allocated to 2 intervention groups. Forty-five participants were treated using a titanium post and 46 participants received a glass fiber post, each in combination with composite core buildups for postendodontic restoration. All posts had a diameter of 1.4 mm and a length of 13 mm and were cemented 8 mm within the root canal with self-adhesive universal resin cement. A circumferential ferrule of 2 mm was always provided. Surgical crown lengthening was necessary in 13 cases. Patients were observed in intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after post placement.\n\nRESULTS: After 24 to 36 months (mean +/- SD: 27.9 +/- 5.6) of observation following post placement, 1 tooth was extracted because of changes of the prosthetic treatment plan. No failures were observed among the 88 patients with follow-up data.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Both titanium and glass fiber reinforced composite posts result in successful treatment outcomes after 2 years. The material combination used seems to be appropriate in the short term for cementing endodontic posts, irrespective of the post material.",

The cell with vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF) as a conductive additive was charged and discharged at current densities of over 1 mA cm-2, while the cell with acetylene black (AB) did not work as a rechargeable battery.

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVES.: The aim was to investigate the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) to a short glass fibers reinforced semi-IPN polymer matrix composite resin. The effect of surface roughness on adhesion was also studied. For comparison, different commercial restorative materials were also evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS.: Experimental composite FC resin was prepared by mixing 22.5 wt% of short E-glass fibers, 22.5 wt% of IPN-resin and 55 wt% of silane treated silica fillers using high speed mixing machine. Three direct composite resins (Z250, Grandio and Nulite), resin-modified glass ionomers (Fuji II LC), amalgam (ANA 2000), fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) (everStick and Ribbond), and pre-fabricated ceramic filling insert (Cerana class 1) were tested in this study. Enamel and dentin were used as controls. The specimens (n=3/group) with or without saliva were incubated in a suspension of S. mutans allowing initial adhesion to occur. For the enumeration of cells on the disc surfaces as colony forming units (CFU) the vials with the microbe samples were thoroughly Vortex-treated and after serial dilutions grown anaerobically for 2 days at +37 degrees C on Mitis salivarius agars (Difco) containing bacitracin. Bacterial adhesion was also evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy. Surface roughness (Ra) of the materials was also determined using a surface profilometer. All results were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS.: Composite FC resin and other commercial restorative materials showed similar adhesion of S. mutans, while adhesion to dentin and enamel was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05). Surface roughness had no effect on bacterial adhesion. Saliva coating significantly decreased the adhesion for all materials (p&lt;0.05). Composite FC resin had a significantly higher Ra value than control groups (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS.: Short fiber-reinforced composite with semi-IPN polymer matrix revealed similar S. mutans adhesion than commercial restorative materials.",

The resultant polymers range in properties from soft rubbers to hard thermosets for composite applications. In this paper we present an investigation of the mechanical properties of glass/flax hybrid composites based on these thermoset matrix materials. Composites with different glass/flax ratios and different fiber arrangements were made using a modified soybean oil matrix material. The fiber arrangement was varied to make symmetric and unsymmetric composites. The latter were tested in different modes in flexural tests and drop weight impact tests. The mechanical properties of the composites were found to depend upon the glass/flax ratio and the arrangement of fibers in the composite. On proper selection of the arrangement of fibers in the composite, the glass fibers and flax fibers were found to act synergistically resulting in an improved flexural and impact performance. © 2005 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

Present work attempts to design and evaluate the performance of double bolted end joint for thermoplastic composite leaf spring. Injection molded 20% glass fiber reinforced polypropylene leaf springs were considered for the joint strength evaluation. Servo hydraulic test facility is utilized to evaluate the static and fatigue performance of the bolted joint. Various bolt sizes were utilized for the joint and its performances were evaluated under static loading condition to understand the effect of fit between bolt and its hole of the joints. Ultimate bearing strength of the joint is found to decrease with the increase in the clearance between bolt and part hole. Joints were subjected to various amplitudes of completely reversed fatigue loads to evaluate the endurance strength. Load-deflection hysteresis plot of the joint under fatigue conditions is continuously measured and used as the bearing damage index of the joint. Inspection of the bearing surface tested under static and fatigue loading condition revealed severe matrix deformation and fibrillation. In spite of unidirectional load being acted at the joint, curved nature of the bearing surface induces bi-axial stresses, which results in severe matrix fibrillation at the bearing surface. Failure morphology under static conditions shows net-tension beside the bearing damage. Failure morphology under fatigue condition revealed net-tension, and shear-out failures besides the bearing damages. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

One of the experimental approaches requires the invasive implantation of an intracranial electrode to excite specific brain structures. In the present report, we describe a procedure for the production of a glass-coated carbon fiber electrode and the use of this electrode for direct activation of the brain in fMRI studies. The glass-coated carbon fiber microelectrode was implanted in the medial thalamus of anaesthetized rats and T2*-weighted gradient echo images in the sagittal plane obtained on a 4.7 T system (Biospec BMT 47/40) during electrical stimulation of the medial thalamus. The image quality obtained using this electrode was acceptable without reduction of the signal-to-noise ratio and image distortion. Cross-correlation analysis showed that the signal intensities of activated areas in the ipsilateral anterior cingulate cortex were significantly increased by about 4-5% during medial thalamus stimulation. The present study shows that glass-coated carbon fiber electrodes are suitable for fMRI studies and can be used to investigate functional thalamocingulate activation. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Fracture toughness testing was made by three-point bending, using six samples of each material with a fiber layer 4 mm upward away from the base and a single notch cut transversal to fibers, without touching them. After statistical analysis, it was concluded that the flexure strength is equal for bars reinforced by polyethylene or glass fibers.

          "abstract": "Cross-linking polymerization initiated by high-energy radiation is a very attractive technique for the fabrication of high-performance composite materials. The method offers many advantages compared to conventional energy- and time-consuming thermal curing processes. Free radical and cationic poly-addition chemistries have been investigated in some details by various research groups along the previous years. A high degree of control over curing kinetics and material properties can be exerted by adjusting the composition of matrix precursors as well as by acting on process parameters. However, the comparison with state-of-the-art thermally cured composites revealed the lower transverse mechanical properties of radiation-cured composites and the higher brittleness of the radiation-cured matrix. Improving fiber-matrix adhesion and upgrading polymer network toughness are thus two major challenges in this area. We have investigated several points related to these issues, and particularly the reduction of the matrix shrinkage on curing, the wettability of carbon fibers, the design of fiber-matrix interface and the use of thermoplastic toughening agents. Significant improvements were achieved on transverse strain at break by applying original surface treatments on the fibers so as to induce covalent coupling with the matrix. A drastic enhancement of the KIC value exceeding 2 MPa m1/2 was also obtained for acrylate-based matrices toughened with high Tg thermoplastics. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Due to recent trend and increasing awareness towards sustainable product design, natural based fiber materials are gaining a revival popularity to replace synthetic based fiber in the formulation of composites especially for automotive structural and semi structural applications. In this paper, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was utilized in the selection of the most suitable natural fiber to be hybridized with glass fiber reinforced polymer composites for the design of a passenger vehicle center lever parking brake component. Thirteen (13) candidate natural based fiber materials for the hybridization process were selected and analyzed to determine their overall scores in three (3) main performance indices according to the component product design specifications. Using the AHP method, the kenaf bast fiber yields the highest scores and was selected as the best candidate material to formulate the hybrid polymer composites for the automotive component construction. Sensitivity analysis was also performed and results show that kenaf bast fiber emerged as the best candidate material in two out of three simulated scenarios, which further validates the results gained through the AHP method. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Four groups of FPDs (3-unit) were fabricated (n=6); Group A: made from commercial composite resin (Sinfony dentin, 3M-ESPE, control), Group B: Sinfony and fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) substructure, Group C: made from FC, Group D: made from FC with 1mm surface layer of Sinfony. The bridges were polymerized with a hand-light curing unit for 40s then post-cured in vacuum curing device (Visio Beta) for 15min before they were statically loaded with speed of 1mm/min until fracture. Failure modes were visually examined.

          "abstract": "This paper describes Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and Spencer Composites Corporation (SCC) efforts in demonstrating an innovative approach to hydrogen delivery. This approach minimizes hydrogen delivery cost through utilization of glass fiber pressure vessels at 200 K and 70 MPa to produce a synergistic combination of container characteristics and properties of hydrogen gas: (1) hydrogen cooled to 200 K is ∼35% more compact for a small increase in theoretical storage energy (exergy); and (2) these cold temperatures (200 K) strengthen glass fibers by as much as 50%, expanding trailer capacity without the use of much more costly carbon fiber composite vessels. Analyses based on US Department of Energy H2A cost and efficiency parameters and economic methodology indicate the potential for hydrogen delivery costs below $1/kg H2 (not including storage at the terminal, and cascade, compression, and chilling at the forecourt, but including compression and refrigeration at the terminal). Further savings are possible by integrating the delivery trailer into the station cascade to avoid chilling typically required for 700 bar hydrogen dispensing. The report also describes experimental work leading to demonstration of the potential for low cost delivery, starting with measurement of cold glass fiber strengthening, and continuing with subscale and full-scale pressure vessel development and testing, and concluding with successful development of an ASME X certifiable full-scale (60 cm diameter) glass fiber pressure vessel made of innovative materials with potential to meet the cost targets when integrated into an insulated tube trailer.

However, the specific wear rate decreases with increase in abrading distance and increases with the load. However, C–E composite showed better abrasion wear resistance compared to G–E composite. The worn surface features have been examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM).

The hydrothermally aged laminates contained a large amount of moisture which caused decrease in the glass transition temperature and deterioration in mechanical properties (interlaminar shear strength, flexural modulus, bearing strength, etc.). Fractographic analysis revealed interfacial debonding as the dominant failure mechanism, indicating a strong influence of water degradation on fracture toughness results.

Moreover, significant improvements were obtained in limiting oxygen index along with maintained Underwriters Laboratories 94 ratings. The flame retardancy mechanism of GRPBT/AHP/clay composite was investigated through thermogravimetric analysis and residue characterization. The results indicated that the well dispersed layered silicates in polymer matrix play an important role of &quot;microreactor&quot; during the combustion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five unreinforced single-edged, notched control specimens and five test specimens reinforced with unidirectional E-glass fibers (Stick) were fabricated from three dimethacrylate-based provisional materials and one monomethacrylate-based provisional material. The specimens were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 1, 7, 30, or 60 days. Specimens were loaded in three-point bending at a cross-head speed of 0.1 mm/s. Mode I plane-strain KIC was calculated using the maximum load, and results of the two groups were compared. The water storage effect on KIC with time was also evaluated. RESULTS: The KIC of provisional materials reinforced with glass fibers (range 7.5 to 13.8 MNm(-1.5)) was significantly higher than that of unreinforced materials (range 1.3 to 3.1 MNm(-1.5)), by a factor of 4.4 to 5.5. A small, gradual decrease of KIC in reinforced specimens occurred with aqueous storage, but it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The KIC of polymer-based provisional crown and FPD materials was significantly increased when they were reinforced with unidirectional E-glass fibers. Water storage for up to 2 months still left the reinforced materials with KIC values in excess of 7 MNm(-1.5). Hence, their performance was satisfactory.",

Interfacial shear strength (IFSS) is evaluated by the microbond technique. The IFSS increases by about 150% for the MCS-treated fibers and by about 50% for the TCS-treated fibers compared to untreated fibers. Dynamic mechanical analysis of composite panels made with untreated and silane-treated fibers reveals that MCS-treated fiber composites have the highest storage modulus and glass transition temperature, indicating strong interfacial interactions at the glass/matrix interface.

Fatigue life decreased with increase in frequency. Hysteretic loss and temperature rise were measured; they depended on the stress amplitude as well as the cyclic frequency. Long fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite showed a lower temperature rise compared to unreinforced PP because long fiber reinforced thermoplastic has higher thermal conductivity than unreinforced PP and thus faster heat dissipation to the surroundings occur.

Kenaf and PET fibers were selected as reinforcements because of their good mechanical properties and resistance to photodegradation . The test samples were produced by compression molding . The samples were exposed to moisture , water spray , and ultraviolet penetration in an accelerated weathering chamber for 672 hours . The tensile strength of the long fiber POM / kenaf (80 / 20) composite dropped by 50% from 127 . 8 to 64 . 8 MPa while that of the hybrid composite dropped by only 2% from 73 . 8 to 72 . 5 MPa . This suggests that the hybrid composite had higher resistance to tensile strength than the POM / kenaf composite . Similarly , the results of flexural and impact strengths also revealed that the hybrid composite showed less degradation compared to the kenaf fiber composite .

          "abstract": "This article presents underwater acoustics evaluation of glass fiber – polyurethane sandwich composite which is useful for ship materials. The composite consists of two main functional laminations namely structural and acoustical lamination. The structural lamination is constructed from polyester and polyethylene fibers while the polyurethane is potential for acoustical lamination. The fabrication involves vacuum bagging and conventional hydraulic methods. The materials will be treated in both with and without immersion in sea water. The immersion process spends about 72 hours. The properties of acoustics for each materials generally have high insertion loss (maximum found 25 dB), but some of them can reach low insertion loss (below 5 dB). The optimization of combination between structural and acoustic materials is promising to be investigated in near future to achieve the optimum properties of materials in terms of sound transparency.",

Therefore, in the present work, a theoretical model based on\nprinciple of conservation of particle kinetic energy is developed to\ndetermine wear rate of glass-polyester composites due to multiple impact\nerosion. Room temperature erosion tests are then carried out to study\nthe effect of various control factors in an interacting environment on\nthe erosion behavior of these composites. For this purpose, design of\nexperiments approach utilizing Taguchi&#039;s orthogonal arrays is adopted to\ntest the specimens on air jet type erosion test configuration. The\nresults indicate that erodent size, fiber loading, impingement angle and\nimpact velocity are the significant factors in the order of their\ninfluence on wear rate. Taguchi approach enables to determine optimal\nparameter settings that lead to minimization of erosion rate. Artificial\nneural network (ANN) approach is applied to the erosive wear data to\nreach at acceptable predictive models. Scanning electron microscopy of\nthe eroded surface of the composites is performed for observation of the\nfeatures such as crack formation, fiber fragmentation and matrix body\ndeformation. Finally, popular evolutionary approach known genetic\nalgorithm (GA) is used to generalize the method of finding out optimal\nfactor settings for minimum wear rate.",

To improve the mechanical properties, jute fiber was hybridized with glass fiber.

The tensile, flexural, impact, density, thermal and water absorption tests were carried out using hybrid composite samples. This study shows that the addition of jute fiber and glass fiber in epoxy, increases the density, the impact energy, the tensile strength and the flexural strength, but decreases the loss mass in function of temperature and the water absorption. Morphological analysis was carried out to observe fracture behavior and fiber pull-out of the samples using scanning electron microscope.",

Though humidity is not supposed to be an issue in operation of the unit, an experimental programme evaluating the material static strength and durability under combination of static load with vibration component was carried out to complete the overall general material characterisation. Study of an effect of absorbed moisture was a part of the experimental work. Water absorption was a long-term process, without saturation even after several months. Degradation of strength and fatigue properties due to the absorbed distilled water was confirmed for this material. The material sensitivity on vibration component of the load, even with quite low amplitude of 10% of the static load was ascertained. Damage accumulation and continuous stiffness reduction during fatigue tests, which rate was connected with final durability, was an important phenomenon. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: This investigation evaluated the effect of glass and polyethylene fiber inserts on the microleakage of Class II composite restorations with gingival margins on root surfaces. METHODS: Fifty-four intact molars were sterilized with Gamma irradiation and mounted in acrylic bases. Class II slot cavities were made on both proximal sides of each tooth (3 mm wide, 1.5 mm deep) with the gingival margin on the root surface. The teeth were divided into nine groups, according to the technique of restoration and type of bonding agent. Filtek P-60 (3M/ESPE) was used to restore all cavities. Two types of fiber inserts were used: glass fiber (Ever Stick, StickTech) and polyethylene (Ribbond-THM), with three bonding agents being employed: Scotch Bond Multipurpose (3M/ESPE), Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray) and Xeno IV (Dentsply). In the experimental groups, 3 mm long fiber inserts were inserted into restorations at the gingival seat. The control groups had no fiber inserts. The restorations were made incrementally and cured with LED light (UltraLume5, Ultradent). The restored teeth were stored in water for two weeks, then thermocycled for 3000 cycles (5 degrees C and 55 degrees C). The tooth surfaces were sealed with nail polish, except at the restoration margins. The teeth were immersed in 2% procion red dye solution, sectioned and dye penetration was assessed to determine the extent of microleakage according to a six-point scale. RESULTS: The fiber groups generally showed reduced microleakage scores compared to the control groups. The Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray)/Filtek P-60 (3M/ESPE) combination produced the lowest degree of microleakage, irrespective of fiber type. However, the glass fiber groups were more consistent in reducing microleakage than the polyethylene groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of fiber inserts significantly reduced gingival microleakage in Class II composite restorations with gingival margins in dentin, irrespective of the adhesive used. Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray)/Filtek P60 (3M/ESPE) produced the lowest microleakage scores.",

          "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced composite materials are being more widely used in many applications. With the increasing applications of these materials, more and more knowledge is needed to get a better understanding of the bonding of the materials, which can lead to different mechanical properties of the materials. The high specific strength along the fiber direction is an important advantage for fiber reinforced polymer composites and the fiber/matrix interface is generally the weakest part of the composites. Thus, the interface/interphase in fiber reinforced composites plays a very important role in determining the composite mechanical properties. In order to achieve the best composite mechanical properties, many efforts have been made to improve interfacial properties. Fiber surface treatments are often used to create a fiber/matrix interface possessing different characteristics so that the fiber strength is utilized effectively under an optimum bonding. There are many methods or treating agents for surface treatment of glass fibers based on protecting fibers from damage and improving the adhesion between fiber and matrix. In general, the silane coupling agents are applied to fibers as a chemical surface treatment and provides a good adhesion between glass fibers and resin matrix. In this study, influences of silane treatment onto glass fiber at fiber-matrix interface were emphasized.",

Emitted photons during the test were detected and a spectroscopic analysis was also performed on the detected photons to determine the source of the emission. Direct observation of the fracture process of the composite reveals that bundle unit fiber fracture occurs from a notch tip and the fracture accompanies characteristic load drop in the load-displacement curve. Photons are detected about 15-30 ??s after the onset of the load drop, which corresponds to the photon emission occurring at the beginning of a bundle unit fiber pullout from the matrix. The emission mechanism is determined to be gaseous ionization discharging of nitrogen molecules, which are contained in ambient air, at a debonded interface. Application of DC potential to the specimen enhances photon intensity and the technique allows photon imaging. Detected photon imaging clearly shows the area of interfacial frictional sliding. It is concluded that the photon emission technique is effective tool to determine interface debonding and sliding behavior in glass fiberreinforced epoxy matrix composite. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

Several groups of specimens were aged in water or in salt solutions containing mass fractions of either 5% NaCl or 10% NaCl for up to 6570 h. Both as-received and aged specimens were then cyclically tested in air or while immersed in water or in salt solution. For specimens cyclically loaded at or above 45% of the average flexural strength of the dry coupons, no substantial difference in fatigue life was observed among all the specimen groups. For samples cyclically loaded at 30% of the dry flexural strength, however, all specimens tested in air survived beyond 107 cycles while all those tested in water environments did not. It is found that long-term environmental fatigue behavior is not controlled by the quantity of water absorbed; rather, it is governed by a combination of both load and fluid environment. No difference in fatigue life was found for specimens aged in different fluid environments at room temperature prior to fatigue testing. Relative to these samples, however, a significant difference was seen for specimens aged in water at 75??C for 2400 h prior to cyclic test at load levels above 30% of the dry flexural strength. When tested at 30% of the dry flexural strength the differences were within the experimental uncertainty. Microscopic examination of the fatigue specimens revealed evidence of a degraded fiber/matrix interphase region in those specimens where environmental exposure caused premature failure so this is believed to be a controlling factor in the environmental performance of the glass composite.",

In order to study the strength degradation, E-glass fibers were immersed in sulfuric acid. Strength reduction, stiffness, and fracture strain of fibers vs. immersion times were studied. The corrosion mechanism of E-glass fiber exposed to acid, were examined by quantitative X-ray fluorescence method. The results showed that corrosion of E-glass fiber was accompanied by removal of Al, Ca, and Fe ions from the fibers. Moreover, intact and degraded fibers were examined by scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis methods to show the relation between the reaction of E-glass fiber elements and acid environment. The ion-depletion-depth model was used to study the fracture process. The results showed that by increasing the immersion time in acid, spiral stress induced due to the shrinkage of E-glass fiber surface caused axial cracks in fibers. Different points of fibers, in which cracks were generated, were examined by EDX method. The results were used to explain the role of Al, Ca, and Fe ions in creation of surface cracks on E-glass fibers subjected to sulfuric acid for different immersion times.",

The proposed non-dimensional analysis is in good agreement with the predictions of existing available fatigue data and present testing data. The model is consistent with the Goodman line relationship and has a clear physical meaning. The fatigue test data of E-glass/polyurethane composites are analyzed using the proposed model, and they are compared with other common E-glass fiber-reinforced plastic composites. It indicates that the E-glass/polyurethane composites are more fatigue sensitive but comparable to other fiber-reinforced plastic composites in their fatigue behaviors. The effects of stress ratio, frequency, and mean stress on fatigue life of E-glass/polyurethane composites are studied and discussed. The corresponding S-N curve and its bounds based on 95% confidence are provided for the pultruded E-glass/polyurethane composites. The present fatigue model can be used as a useful tool to characterize the effects of various parameters on the fatigue behavior of fiber-reinforced plastic composites, and it provides the fatigue life prediction for newly developed pultruded E-glass/polyurethane composites.",

Many concrete columns in bridges designed before the new seismic design provisions were adopted have low flexural ductility, low shear strength, and inadequate lap length for starter bars. These problems, compounded by flaws in the design of structural systems, have contributed to the catastrophic bridge failures in recent earthquakes. In this paper a new technique for seismic strengthening of concrete columns is presented The technique requires wrapping thin, flexible high-strength fiber composite straps around the column to improve the confinement and, thereby, its ductility and strength. Analytical models are presented that quantify the gain in strength and ductility of concrete columns externally confined by means of high-strength fiber composite straps. A parametric study is conducted to examine the effects of various design parameters such as concrete compressive strength, thickness and spacing of straps, and type of strap. The results indicate that the strength and ductility of concrete columns can be significantly increased by wrapping high-strength fiber composite straps around the columns.",

An inert atmosphere was used to study the effects of temperature alone, thus minimizing and neglecting the effects of oxidation. The mechanical properties of aged samples were evaluated at room-temperature by using four-point flexure strength and three-point flexure chevron-notch techniques. The inter-facial properties were determined by push-out indentation measurements using an in-situ SEM indentation apparatus. The fracture toughness values determined by the chevron-notch tests were little affected by the aging conditions and were in the range 19-36 h MPa root m. The frictional interfacial shear stress was not affected by the aging conditions either. For the most severe aging conditions investigated (1000 h at 600 degrees C and 100 h at 700 degrees C), a significant loss of flexure strength and stiffness of the samples was detected, which has been ascribed to microstructural changes that occurred in the material during aging as a consequence of the softening of the glass matrix. At these aging conditions, a lower interfacial shear stress for fiber-matrix debonding initiation was measured, which may be explained also by the occurrence of matrix softening and void formation.

          "abstract": "Lignocellulosic fibers, such as henequen, sisal, coconut fiber (coir), jute, palm and bamboo, have been used as reinforcement materials for different thermosetting and thermoplastic resins because of their attractive physical and mechanical properties. Unlike the traditional engineering fibers, e.g. glass and carbon fibers, and mineral fillers, these lignocellulosic fibers are able to impart certain benefits such as low density, less machine wear, no health hazards, and a high degree of flexibility to the composite. The last attribute is especially true because these lignocellulosic fibers will bend rather than fracture, like glass fibers do, during processing of the composite. The mechanical properties and fracture behavior of a natural fiber reinforced polymer composite depend, not only on the properties of constituents, but also on the properties of the region surrounding the fiber, known as the interphase, where the stress transfer takes place. Moreover, the tailoring of the interphase by means of surface treatments, and carefully characterizing it, gives a better understanding of the performance of natural-fiber reinforced composites. The fracture toughness resulting from the use of natural fibers as reinforcing materials is quite different between ductile and brittle polymers, as well as between quasi-static and impact loading rates. The aim of this paper is to study the effect of the interphase properties, resulting from well controlled surface treatment of the natural fibers, on the behavior of a ductile polymer matrix composite under quasi-static loading using the essential work of fracture criteria. Specifically, the contribution of each of the different fiber-matrix interfacial adhesion levels towards the dissipation energy were analyzed and discussed. In the case of the plastic work ??wp, there seems to be a synergy between the frictional and chemical interactions observed for both, low and high strain rates. The nonlinear mechanical behavior of the natural fiber under combined tensile-shear loads has also an effect on the fracture behavior of the composite. Additionally, different fiber surface treatments change the microstructural nature of the natural fiber, further affecting its behavior, particularly under high loading rates. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Continuous unidirectional E-glass fibers were preimpregnated with a novel biopolymer of poly(hydroxyproline) amide and ester. The preimpregnated fibers were then further impregnated in a co-monomer system of Bis-GMA-TEGDMA, which formed semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPN) with the preimpregnated polymer. After light initiated polymerization of the monomer system, rectangular shaped bar specimens (n = 4) were tested by the three-point bending test. The control material was a fiber-reinforced composite with a Bis-GMA-TEDGMA-matrix only. The mean flexural strength of poly(hydroxyproline) amide preimpregnated fiber composite was higher than that of the control (FS = 888 vs. 805 MPa). The poly(hydroxyproline) ester preimpregnated fibers resulted in lower strength (FS = 541 MPa). The results of this study suggest that preimpregnation of glass fibers with poly(hydroxyproline) amide and the use of such fibers in fiber-reinforced composites with IPN polymer matrices, can reach relatively high mechanical properties.",

Data for the fiber strength σc at the critical fiber length δc for five kinds of treated fibers are used for predicting UTS, which is obtained from both single fiber composite (SFC) and single fiber tension (SFT) tests, σc from SFC is attained using the Curtin theory on the fragmentation of SFC, while that from SFT is determined using a linear extrapolation of SFT data. Under good interface adhesion, the predicted UTS values based on the SFC data show the best agreement with measured ones at various fiber volume fractions, but a higher predicted value is obtained if the interface failure is matrix-controlled. For poor interfacial adhesion, the predicted UTS values are rather high compared to experimental ones due to the ineffective stress transfer. The predicted values based on the SFT data are much higher than the measured value for good interfacial adhesion.",

But little work has been done to systematically investigate the effect of shear on the structures and properties of long glass fiber reinforced thermoplastics. The purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of shear on fiber orientation, fiber breakage and matrix molecular orientation in long glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composites, and to construct the structure-property relations. A so-called dynamic packing injection molding (DPIM) technique, which imposed oscillatory shear (10s-1) on the gradually cooled melt during the packing solidification stage, was used to prepare the dynamic samples, and optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize the samples. The results show that despite the well-published enhanced fiber and matrix orientation, shear will cause a remarkable fiber breakage. Combined effect of fiber breakage and orientation on the mechanical properties of the composites was qualitatively investigated and tensile properties of the dynamic samples, the conventional injection molded samples and the short glass fiber reinforced samples were compared. It is demonstrated that shear will induce more severe fiber breakage in long glass fiber reinforced polypropylene than in short glass fiber reinforced polypropylene, and that compromising the decreased strength caused by the severe fiber breakage is very difficult. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

In order to design the effective electromagnetic wave (EM) absorber with the fiber reinforced polymeric laminate composite, its electromagnetic characteristics should be available and could be regulated easily in the target frequency bands. In this study, dielectric characteristics of the E-glass/epoxy laminate composites were measured by the free space method in the X-band frequency (8.2-12.4 GHz). In order to describe the dielectric behavior of laminate composites of arbitrary stacking sequences, the equivalent circuit model and the laminating equations for estimating dielectric properties were proposed, and experimentally verified. From the comparison of the predicted and measured data, the proposed method predicted well the experimentally measured data. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Basalt fiber and glass powder were adopted as the replacements of traditional stabilizer and filler. The experimental samples were made by tyre rubber powder modified asphalt mixture, basalt fiber, lime stone powder and basalt glass powder. The dynamic stability of the samples at 60 °C was indexed by the runs of automobile tracking. The samples with lime rock powder had the basalt fiber contents 0%, 0.2%, 0.25% and 0.3%, respectively. The corresponding dynamic stabilities were 4500 run/mm, 5300run/mm, &gt;6000 run/mm and 5400run/mm. The samples with basalt glass powder had the basalt fiber contents 0%, 0.2% and 0.25%, respectively. The dynamic stability went above the upper limit of the tester when the basalt fiber content was 0.2%. The control group of basalt glass powder modified sample had 5600run/mm, whereas the control group of lime rock modified sample was 4500run/mm, of which the increment was 24%. We may conclude that the effect of basalt fiber reinforcement was significant. In addition, the basalt glass powder is better than lime rock powder, as the filler of asphalt composite. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",

The use of sisal, a natural fiber with enhanced mechanical performance, as reinforcement in a cement based matrix has shown to be a promising opportunity. This work addresses the development and advances of strain hardening cement composites using sisal fiber as reinforcement. Sisal fibers were used as a fabric to reinforce a multi-layer cementitious composite with a low content of Portland cement. Monotonic direct tensile tests were performed in the composites. The crack spacing during tension was measured by image analysis and correlated to strain. Local and global deformation was addressed. To demonstrate the high performance of the developed composite in long term applications, its resistance to tensile fatigue cycles was investigated. The composites were subjected to tensile fatigue load with maximum stresses ranging from 4 to 9.6 MPa at a frequency of 2 Hz. The composites did not fatigue below a maximum fatigue level of 6 MPa up to 106 cycles. Monotonic tensile testing was performed for composites that survived 106 cycles to determine its residual strength.",

The resin injection step in LCM consists of two simultaneous flows: bulk mold filling and tow wetting. This complexity often results in the entrapment of air in the composite part, which is known to result in degradation of part performance, In this work, systematic investigation of the resin flow behavior through various types of glass fiber reinforcements is carried out by flow visualization. The objective is to relate the fiber mat architecture to the micro scale flow pattern and void formation, movement, and removal. An optical image analysis and processing technique is developed to help quantify void formation, Void formation is related to liquid properties and fiber-liquid contact angle. Although the focus of the study is LCM, the results can be directly applied to other composite manufacturing processes that involve advancement of resin in a dry fiber reinforcement.",

Additions of MgO-filler to the sodium aluminosilicate (NAS) base glass increased the coefficient of thermal expansion of the composite to ???12 ppm and provided a sufficient match between the components to allow for thermal cycling of the interfaces. The optimisation of composite seals with long-term compliancy showed promising results in terms of being able to control both the bonding strength and interface reactivity between metal and glass. The reactivity increased with temperature and protection of the surface by pre-oxidation did not alter the picture. Etching the metal surfaces in combination with application of Mn-, Co-, or Ni-oxide coatings reduced the metal-glass interactions and for the Ni- and Co-oxide coatings facilitated an excellent bond and gradual changing interface between the glass and metal. Samples were tested in model experiments and performance tested in multi-cell stacks. Both pure NAS glass and NAS/MgO composite material developed gas tight sealing performance, when sealed at 950 ??C and showed low, constant levels of leakage throughout multiple thermal cyclings after more than 5000 h run time in stack testing. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Elemental analysis confirmed a very well-defined core-clad interface with a step-profile in composition and nominally 4 weight-percent oxygen having diffused into the germanium core from the glass cladding. For this proof-of-concept fiber, polycrystalline n-type germanium of unknown dopant concentration was used. The measured infrared transparency of the starting material was poor and, as a likely outcome, the attenuation of the resultant fiber was too high to be measured. However, the larger Raman cross-section, infrared and terahertz transparency of germanium over silicon should make these fibers of significant value for fiber-based mid- to long-wave infrared and terahertz waveguides and Raman-shifted infrared light sources once high-purity, high-resistivity germanium is employed.",

The effects of fiber reinforcement are evaluated for various physical, short-term, and long-term benefits they impart to the concrete mixture. A variety of test methods, conditions, and properties are reported. The various properties listed, in addition to the wide variety of the choices available in formulating matrix systems, allow performance- based specification of concrete materials using fibers to become a viable option. This document provides a historical basis and an overview of the current knowledge of FRC materials for tailoring new, sustainable, and durable concrete mixtures. This document is divided into three sections. The first section discusses the physical properties of FRC in terms of electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties. Rheological properties, which affect fiber dispersion and distribution, are discussed using both empirical and quantitative rheology. Mechanisms of creep and shrinkage and the role of various fiber types in affecting both plastic shrinkage cracking and restrained shrinkage cracking are also addressed. The durability of concrete as affected by the addition of fibers is documented under freezing and thawing, corrosion resistance, and scaling. The durability of FRC systems is also affected as different fibers respond differently to the highly alkaline cementitious microstructure. The durability of alkali-resistant glass and cellulose fibers are studied by an in-depth evaluation of long-term accelerated aging results. Degradation and embrittlement due to alkali attack and bundle effect are discussed. Recent advances for modeling and design of materials with aging characteristics are presented. Literature on the use of FRC materials under aggressive environments, extreme temperatures, and fire is presented. The final sections list a series of applications where the use of FRC has resulted in beneficial durability considerations",

It has been found that its reinforcement unit, hollow, multilayered and spirally-wound bast fiber, plays an extremely important role in its mechanical behavior. In the present work, on the basis of the study on bamboo bast fiber and wood tracheid, a biomimetic model of the reinforcing element, composed of two layers of helically wound fiber, was suggested. To detect the structural characteristics of such a microstructure, four types of macro fiber specimens made of engineering composites were employed: axially aligned solid and hollow cylinders, and single- and double-helical hollow cylinders. These specimens were subjected to several possible loadings, and the experimental results reveal that only the double-helical structural unit possesses the optimum comprehensive mechanical properties. An interlaminar transition zone model imitating bamboo bast fiber was proposed and was verified by engineering composite materials. In our work, the transition zone can increase the interlaminar shear strength of the composite materials by about 15%. These biomimetic structural models can be applied in the design and manufacture of engineering composite materials. ?? 1995.",

Cadaver bones are suboptimal for many reasons, including issues of cost, availability, preservation, and inconsistency between specimens. Further, cadaver samples disproportionately represent the elderly, whose bone quality may not be representative of the greater orthopaedic population. The current fourth-generation composite bone models provide an accurate reproduction of the biomechanical properties of human bone when placed under bending, axial, and torsional loads. The combination of glass fiber and epoxy resin components into a single phase has enabled manufacturing by injection molding. The high level of anatomic fidelity of the cadaver-based molds and negligible shrinkage properties of the epoxy resin results in a process that allows for excellent definition of anatomic detail in the cortical wall and optimized consistency of features between models. Recent biomechanical studies of composites have validated their use as a suitable substitute for cadaver specimens.",

Compared with BA-ph, EP/BA-ph copolymer processability was improved and can be controlled by varying EP contents, processing temperature, and time. Then EP/BA-ph copolymers were employed to prepare EP/BA-ph/glass fiber (GF) composite laminates and their mechanical, morphological, and thermal properties were investigated. Compared with those of BA-ph/GF composites, the flexural strength, and modulus of EP/BA-ph/GF composites with 50 wt % EP content were increased by 13.5 and 20%, respectively. The enhancements in mechanical properties are mainly due to the strong interfacial adhesions between GF and matrices, which was confirmed by SEM observations. All EP/BA-ph/GF composite laminates are stable up to 510 degrees C in air.

The stress the composite can withstand can be modified with changing fiber material and weave geometry. The resulting SMP—fiber composites can be designed with glass transition temperatures (Tg’s) ranging from 0°C to 75°C, and specific multi-layer combinations of these systems provide a promising candidate for orthopedic casts: specifically, a woven anteres nylon lycra mesh rigidized with a polymer synthesized from methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate, and trimethylol propane triacrylate.

A composite material sample with an embedded PM-PCF based polarimetric fiber sensor is fabricated and characterized. It is found that the buffer stripped PM-PCF polarimetric sensor which is temperature insensitive in free space, shows significant phase change when embedded in the composite material due the thermal elongation of the composite material. The temperature induced phase change of buffer stripped PM-PCF polarimetric sensors embedded in carbon-epoxy, E glass-epoxy, E glass-unsaturated polyester resin composite material samples is measured and the results are used to determine the thermal elongation induced strain over a temperature range from 0 °C to 65 °C. The experimentally measured thermal elongation induced strain of the same samples are found to be 3.648 × 10-5 ε/°C, 1.52 × 10-5 ε/°C, and 2.42 × 10-5 ε/°C. The Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) estimated theoretically using composite laminate theory shows good agreement with that derived using the PM-PCF sensor. The present investigation offers a simple non destructive method to determine thermal elongation induced strain in composite structures. It is shown that the method allows the measurement of thermal expansion for those composite materials having negligible residual strain and moisture expansion.

RECENT FINDINGS: Pathogenic mutations have been identified in eight genes and there is evidence of further genetic heterogeneity in nemaline myopathy. Clinical presentation, histological features on skeletal muscle biopsy, and pattern of changes on muscle MRI may guide prioritization of molecular genetic testing. It is anticipated that use of new technologies such as whole exome sequencing and comparative genomic hybridization will increase the number of genes associated with nemaline myopathy and the proportion of patients in whom the genetic basis of the disorder is identified. Single fiber studies and animal models continue to add to understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder. Current management focuses on supportive treatment; however, encouraging advances are emerging for the future. SUMMARY: Recent advances in understanding of nemaline myopathy have important implications for clinical practice and for genetic diagnosis of patients with nemaline myopathy.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the environmental performance of kenaf fiber reinforced biocomposite (polyhydroxybutyrate/kenaf fiber) via life cycle assessment and compares its environmental performance to that of glass fiber reinforced composite (polypropylene/glass fiber). The system boundary in the analysis covers the entire life cycle of kenaf fiber reinforced biocomposite from cradle to grave. Two waste management scenarios are included in the analysis to determine the environmental effects due to waste management scenarios: landfill and composting. Using kenaf fiber reinforced biocomposite as a raw material for automobile parts instead of glass fiber reinforced composite can reduce nonrenewable energy consumption by 23-24% and greenhouse gas emissions by 6-16%. However, the kenaf fiber reinforced biocomposite product system produces more local environmental impacts such as photochemical smog formation, acidification and eutrophication than the glass fiber reinforced composite product system because of nutrient losses to the environment during biomass production. Among the environmental impacts considered in this study, only greenhouse gas emissions associated with the kenaf fiber reinforced biocomposite product system are significantly affected by the waste management scenarios. The composting scenario produces less greenhouse gas emissions than the landfill scenario because some of the carbon in kenaf fiber reinforced biocomposite is sequestered in soil as soil organic carbon when compost made from kenaf fiber reinforced biocomposite is applied to the land. The environmentally sensitive sub-processes for nonrenewable energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are polyhydroxybutyrate manufacturing, injection molding and kenaf fiber production processes. Polyhydroxybutyrate manufacturing and injection molding are energy intensive processes. The sodium hydroxide solution used in the fiber surface treatment is the primary environmentally sensitive parameter in kenaf fiber production process in terms of nonrenewable energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.",

In addition, the influence of water storage on the properties was determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rhombic test specimens for four groups were milled from bulk FRC material DC-Tell. The test specimens of the first group were stored and tested dry. In the second group, the test specimens were water stored for 3 months at 37 +/- 1 degrees C and tested in water. The specimens of the third group were also water stored, but they were tested dry at room temperature. Water-stored test specimens of the fourth group were dehydrated and tested dry at room temperature. A three-point bending test was used to measure the flexural properties. The quantity of glass fibers in the test specimens was determined by combustion analysis. Water uptake was calculated after 3 months of water immersion. The direction and length of fibers were examined, and elemental composition was determined. RESULTS: Water storage decreased the flexural strength by 66% and flexural modulus by 60%. After dehydration, the flexural strength did not recover to the same level as the flexural strength of the dry-group specimens. The fiber content was 38% by volume. Water uptake was 3 wt%. The reinforcement of DC-Tell was short fibers in random orientation, and the elemental composition of fibers was similar to that of E-glass. CONCLUSION: Water storage decreases the flexural properties of the bulk fiber-reinforced composite DC-Tell. This may restrict the use of DC-Tell as a framework of crowns and bridges in the oral cavity in the long term.",

Intimately mixed short glass-sisal hybrid fiber reinforced polyethylene composites (GSRP) were prepared by solution mixing technique. The effects of fiber orientation and alkali treatment on sisal fiber in GSRP were studied. Addition of relatively small volume fraction of glass (0.03) to the sisal reinforced polyethylene matrix (SRP) enhances the tensile strength of longitudinally oriented composites by about 80%. Addition of the same volume fraction of glass to the alkali treated sisal incorporated SRP enhances the tensile strength by more than 90%. The flexural strength of the longitudinally oriented composites was also studied. The incorporation of glass fiber (V f = 0.03) to SRP enhances the flexural strength by more than 60%. The effect of hybridization on water absorption tendency of the sisal fiber was studied by immersing SRP and GSRP in boiling water for 3 hours. It was observed that water uptake of GSRP was 2 to 4 times less than that of SRP composites. Halpin-Tsai equation for composites was tried for calculating the tensile modulus of longitudinally oriented GSRP.",

Kenaf fibre is a natural fibre which is growing in popularity due environmental issues and its properties as filler. Epoxy is a versatile thermosetting polymer which has a low curing temperature and used in making carbon fibre and glass composites. In this paper the properties of kenaf bast fibre epoxy reinforced composite have been investigated. The effects of alkali surface treatment of the fiber on the composite properties are also investigated. A hand layup method was use to fabricate the test specimens. Generally, all the treated fibre composites performed better than the untreated fibre with an improvement approximately 5% to 10%. Epoxy has the highest tensile strength and flexural strength among all specimens. The 24wt% treated kenaf fibre composites has the highest tensile strength, 27.72MPa and flexural strength, 56.91MPa. The kenaf fiber weight fraction of 40% gave the highest impact strength. The impact strength of the 40wt% kenaf fiber increased 14.3% after alkali treatment.",

          "abstract": "A Leaf spring is a simple form of spring commonly used for the suspension in wheeled vehicles. Weight reduction is the major problem faced by many automobile industries. Weight reduction can be achieved by designing new materials, sophisticated manufacturing processes. Due to increasing competition and innovation in recent decade&#039;s automobile industries shown interest on replacing conventional steel leaf spring with fiber reinforced composite leaf spring which has advantages as higher strength to weight ratio, higher stiffness, high impact energy absorption and lesser stresses. Selection of constituents for the composites is based on the type of application, availability, strength required and cost of material. In this work an attempt is made to develop a natural and synthetic fiber reinforced hybrid composite material with optimum properties so that it can replace the existing synthetic fiber reinforced composite material and conventional steel in automobile leaf spring. Banana and E-glass woven fabrics are used as reinforcements and Epoxy resin LY556 and Hardener HY 951 is used as the matrix material. The CAD models of Leaf spring are prepared in CATIA V5 R20 and imported ANSYS 15.0 workbench where finite element analysis (FEA) is performed. This study gives a comparative analysis between steel (65Si7) leaf spring and Banana/E glass reinforced Epoxy leaf spring. The hybrid composite leaf spring is found to have up to 81% weight reduction, lesser cost, lesser stresses, higher strain energy.",

          "abstract": "The shear strength of the fiber/resin interface in a fiber-reinforced composite is usually determined by measuring the force needed to pull a single fiber axially out of the solid matrix. To make such pull-out measurements, however, the length of embedded fiber must be small enough so that the fiber does not break before it pulls free. This is difficult to achieve by conventional methods with fibers of small diameter, such as the high-strength glass, Aramid, and carbon fibers now extensively used in practice. The approach taken is to deposit a droplet of the matrix resin on the fiber and to support the cured droplet appropriately during pull-out. Successful shear debondings are obtained in most trials, and the nature of the recorded force curves during the trial distinguishes between proper shear debonding and slipping of the droplet or fiber breakage. Interfacial bond strength results for an epoxy resin and several fiber types are adequately reproducible and are reasonable in light of the nature of the fiber surfaces, indicating that the microband method may be generally applicable.",

          "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced polymer composites are being studied for many applications because of their potential for outstanding mechanical properties. To be used in new applications, composites have to be more fully understood. The fiber, the matrix, and the fiber/matrix interface are the building blocks that need study. This research has concentrated on the interface where debonds, or damage need to be studied more thoroughly. The experimental work here focused on the fragmentation test. The specimens used were AS4-carbon/Epoxy and E-glass/Epoxy composites. The fragmentation process was continuously monitored with careful attention to debonding at each break and debonding growth at higher strain as a function of applied tensile strain. Photoelastic birefringence patterns in the specimen were observed in more detail than ever to accurately monitor interfacial debonding and damage. The fiber fracture and the debonding length between the fiber and the matrix were measured only by visual observation using the photoelastic patterns rather than the Laser Raman Spectroscopy (LRS) which has usually been used in measuring interfacial debonding length or damage. This visual measurement technique provides the much simpler and more precise method than traditional LRS in measuring the fiber fracture and the interfacial damage in fiber-embedded composites. From the experimental data of fiber breaks and interfacial debond length, the interfacial toughness between the fiber and the matrix was analyzed for each composite system using the energy method. The interfacial debond energy, Γd, of AS4-Carbon/Epoxy was 220 J/m2 and 130 J/m2 for instantaneous debond and whole debond, respectively. For E-glass/Epoxy, Γd was obtained as 105 J/m2 and 98 J/m2 for instantaneous debond and whole debond, respectively.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate current and potential uses of composite materials for the petroleum industry. This article gathered all the available composite materials that are normally used specially in oilfield and surface pipeline applications. Out of those, four fiberglass-reinforced plastic materials (i.e., AR-glass, boron-free E-glass, C-glass, and E-glass) were selected to conduct an experiment in acidic and alkaline environments. The results show that AR-glass is corrosion resistant at high temperature and high acidic and alkaline environments. The weight loss due to corrosion is less than the other three materials. Boron-free E-glass is also better than C-glass and E-glass, especially in acidic environment. Another aspect of this research is to find out a research gateway toward the development of sustainable composites. When toxic components are used during the development of new materials, nowadays, this becomes an issue for environmental groups. Therefore, this study suggests the researchers to look for an environment-friendly, sustainable composite material that can be widely used in the petroleum industry. Finally, the trend of future research has been outlined and an indication of sustainable composite material choice has been proposed for oilfield applications.",

In addition, the molecular structure and the thermal stability of epoxy matrix were investigated by means of UV-Vis spectra, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). It is found that the ILSS at 77 K was affected scarcely up to 5 MGy but decreased significantly after 10 MGy irradiation. The thermal properties of the resin decreased with the increasing irradiation dose. These results can be interpreted by the crosslinking and degradation of the epoxy matrix.

For all the four composition groups, mechanical properties including hardness, flexural strength and modulus in both three-point and four-point bendings were tested (n = 6), together with water sorption and solubility study (n = 6) and fracture site scanning with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The experimental specimens were relatively strong and stiff in three-point bending compared to previous research. The same specimens in three-point bending had a lower flexural modulus and fractured at higher flexural stress than in four-point bending. According to the SEM images after fracture, some resin matrix was still bound to the fiber surface, showing cohesive-interfacial fracture type and relatively stable matrix-fiber adhesion.

The classical laminated plate theory (CLT) was applied for describing the off-axis inelastic behavior of GLARE 2 laminate. Irrespective of the off-axis angle, a sharp-transition caused by the yielding of aluminum alloy layers appears in the stress-strain relations. The nonlinearity of the behavior of GLARE 2 after this transition increases more significantly as the off-axis angle becomes larger. The tensile-fracture strength of the GLARE 2 laminate is almost two times as large as that of the monolithic aluminum alloy in the fiber direction, and it is about five times the value of the GFRP in the transverse direction. The anisotropy for the tensile fracture strength of the GLARE 2 laminate can be predicted using the Tsai-Hill theory. For the off-axis angles &gt; 5 degrees, transverse cracks develop in the GFRP layers before the GLARE 2 laminate fractures. A CLT-based model, which takes into account the transverse failure in the GFRP layers to cause an instantaneous degradation of transverse and shear elastic moduli, accurately describes the characteristic deformation behavior of the GLARE 2 laminate.

          "abstract": "Natural/Bio-fiber composites (Bio-Composites) are emerging as a viable alternative to glass fiber reinforced composites especially in automotive applications. Natural fibers, which traditionally were used, as fillers for thermosets, are now becoming one of the fastest growing performance additives for thermoplastics. Advantages of natural fibers over man-made glass fiber are: low cost, low density, competitive specific mechanical properties, reduced energy consumption, carbon dioxide sequesterization, and biodegradability. Natural fibers offer a possibility to developing countries to use their own natural resources in their composite processing industries. The combination of bio-fibers like Kenaf, Hemp, Flax, Jute, Henequen, Pineapple leaf fiber and Sisal with polymer matrices from both non-renewable and renewable resources to produce composite materials that are competitive with synthetic composites requires special attention i.e. biofiber-matrix interface and novel processing. Natural fiber reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites have attained commercial attraction in automotive industries. Needle punching techniques as well as extrusion followed by injection molding for natural fiber – PP composites as presently adopted in the industry need a “greener” technology - - powder impregnation technology. Natural fiber – PP or natural fiber – polyester composites are not sufficiently eco-friendly due to the petro-based source as well as non-biodegradable nature of the polymer matrix. Sustainability, industrial ecology, eco- efficiency and green chemistry are forcing the automotive industry to seek alternative, more Eco-friendly materials for automotive interior applications. Using natural fibers with polymers (plastics) based on renewable resources will allow many environmental issues to be solved. By embedding bio-fibers with renewable resource based bio- polymers such as cellulosic plastic, corn-based plastic, starch plastic and soy-based plastic are continuously being developed at Michigan State University.",

The effect of hybridization with glass fiber and the chemical modification of the fiber on the water absorption properties of the prepared composites were also evaluated. In the case of hybrid composites, water uptake decreased with increase of glass fiber content. In the case of chemically modified fiber composites, water uptake was found to be dependent on the chemical treatment done on the fiber surface. Weight change profiles of the composites at higher temperature indicated that the diffusion is close to Fickian. The water absorption showed a multistage mechanism in all cases at lower temperatures. Chemical modification was found to affect the water uptake of the composite. Among the treated composites the lowest water uptake was observed for composites treated with silane A1100. Finally, parameters like diffusion, sorption, and permeability coefficients were determined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The glass-fiber post was placed into a root canal preparation under clinical conditions and documented. A few restored teeth were extracted after 1 week and processed for SEM observations to determine the bonding mechanism to root dentin under clinical conditions. RESULTS: The SEM observations clearly showed that the bonding mechanism between Excite Dual Cure and root dentin was based on hybrid layer, resin tag, and adhesive lateral branch formation. CONCLUSION: The luting procedure described is simple and easy, and can be proposed as a daily clinical technique.",

Samples were immersed in deionized (DI) water and salt water, and glass/epoxy composites were used as a benchmark for comparison. Composites of pDCPD showed less water uptake and superior fatigue performance compared to similarly aged epoxy composites, a distinction attributed to the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the pDCPD resin. Superior fiber-matrix interface adhesion in pDCPD composites accounted for the greater strength retention after aging. Degradation of fiber and interface were coupled but not synchronous: glass fiber degradation was determined by aging time, while interface degradation depended primarily on moisture level. Salt water influenced the amount of water absorption, but no salt water corrosion was observed for either composite.",

The null hypothesis tested was that fracture resistance and the failure pattern of these teeth were not affected by the use of FRC posts or by the type of full-coverage crown. One hundred twenty maxillary incisors were endodontically treated and divided into 4 groups of 30 each. Each group was divided into two subgroups: restoration with or without fiber post. PFM crowns were placed in group 1, Empress II crowns in group 2, SR Adoro crowns in group 3, and Cercon crowns in group 4. Fracture tests were performed by loading specimens to fracture. Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (?? = 0.05). The type of crown was not a significant factor affecting fracture resistance (p = 0.4), whereas the presence of a post was (p = 0.001). Both the presence of post and the type of crown had a significant influence on the proportion of restorable versus unrestorable fractures. Although prosthodontics textbooks do not generally advocate the placement of fiber posts in endodontically treated incisors, the results of this study indicate that the use of fiber posts in such teeth increases their resistance to fracture and improves the prognosis in case of fracture. ?? 2008 American Association of Endodontists.",

The knitted fabrics used for the study are manufactured from the 200 tex glass yarn with epoxy resin and cured in a hot press machine. The experiments were carried out according to the ASTM D953 standard [1]. The ratio of the edge distance to the pin diameter (E/d), and the ratio of the specimen width to the pin diameter (W/d) were systematically varied during experiments. The results show that the bearing values obtained from the wale directions are stronger than the course and 45° directions. Additionally, each direction reaches their upper limit bearing strengths when E/d and W/d ratios are equal or greater than 4.

A longitudinal clinical investigation with a follow-up time of 4 years was conducted. METHODS: A cranial bone reconstruction with the implant was performed on 12 patients. In these patients, the reasons for craniotomies resulting in craniofacial bone defects were traumatic and spontaneous intracranial bleeding as well as infections to the primary reconstruction material. The implant material consisted of a supporting fiber-reinforced framework, porous inner layers, and a bioactive glass (BG; S53P4) filling. The framework and the porous layers were made of a bisphenol-a-glycidyl methacrylate and triethyleneglycoldi-methacrylate (pBisGMA-pTEGDMA) resin matrix, which was reinforced with silanized E-glass. RESULTS: In clinical examinations and skull X-rays, the implants were in original positions providing the expected functional and aesthetic outcome at all time points. CONCLUSION: The implants functioned appropriately, which would provide a potential solution for craniofacial bone reconstruction in the future.",

          "abstract": "A multiphase finite element model using the commercial finite element package ABAQUS/ EXPLICIT is developed for simulating the orthogonal machining of unidirectional fiber reinforced composite materials. The composite materials considered for this study are a glass fiber reinforced epoxy and a tube formed carbon fiber reinforced epoxy. The effects of varying the fiber orientation angle and tool rake angle on the cutting force and damage during machining are considered for the glass fiber reinforced epoxy. In the case of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy, only the effect of fiber orientation on the measured cutting force and damage during machining is considered. Two major damage phenomena are predicted: debonding at the fiber-matrix interface and fiber pullout. In the multiphase approach, the fiber and matrix are modeled as continuum elements with Isotropic properties separated by an interfacial layer, while the tool is modeled as a rigid body. The cohesive zone modeling approach is used for the interfacial layer to simulate the extent of debonding below the work surface. Bulk deformation and shear failure are considered in the matrix for both the models and the glass fiber. A brittle failure criterion is used for the carbon fiber specimen and is coded in FORTRAN as a user defined material (VUMAT). The brittle failure of the carbon fibers is modeled using the Mango model for brittle failure. For validation purposes, simulation results of the multiphase approach are compared with experimental measurements of the cutting force and damage. The model is successful in predicting cutting forces and damage at the front and rear faces with respect to the fiber orientation. A successful prediction of fiber pullout is also demonstrated in this paper. Copyright 2008 by ASME.",

We found that laminate stiffness increased linearly with fibre concentration up to 40% w/w. However, stiffness was virtually independent of fibre length above 0.5mm. Predictions of tensile modulus using the Cox model correlated well with the experimental data. High concentrations of long fibres (&gt;40% w/w) resulted in fibre packing problems and an increase in void content which lead to a reduction in modulus.

The static bending tests of the beams were performed for the optimum fiber stacking sequence, followed by the static tensile tests of the joint between the composite beam and the brackets on the car body. In order to increase the energy absorption characteristics of the composite impact beam, the mechanical joint was designed to fail with fiber shear-out mode, from which the impact energy might be dissipated during the side-door collision of passenger cars.

Microscopic damage in short fiber reinforced composite are described by fiber failure and fiber/matrix interfacial debonding. Numerical methods are implemented to predict the fiber failure and failure in the fiber/matrix interface layer. Predictions of these types of failures have been applied to determine damages in each loading cycle. The work has been simulated adopting the concept of 3D unit cell models. The Weibull damage law is used to predict the microscopic damage behavior of composites taking into account the fiber volume fractions and orientation of fibers (0° and 90°) in the composite. By comparing the simulation with the experimental stress-strain curves for tension, the Weibull damage parameters are determined. Using these damage parameters a mesoscopic model of polymer matrix composites (PMCs) reinforced with 8.1 vol.% glass fibers including the effect of fiber-clusters is developed and the damage during cyclic loading is predicted. Good agreement is found for the reduction of the effective Young&#039;s modulus due to damage between experiment and the simulation using the proposed fatigue model. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The results revealed that Po/BA-ph systems exhibited double-stage curing behaviors which corresponded to the ring-opening polymerization of benzoxazine rings and ring-formation polymerization of nitrile groups. Compared with Po, processability of Po/BA-ph blends was improved and could be tuned by varying BA-ph contents, processing temperature, and time. The structures of the copolymers were also characterized and discussed to further confirm the copolymerizing behaviors. Then Po/BA-ph copolymers were employed to prepare Po/BA-ph/glass fiber (GF) composite laminates, and their mechanical and thermal properties were investigated. Compared with those of Po/GF composites, the flexural strength and modulus of Po/BA-ph/GF composites were increased by 6.5 and 25 %, respectively. All of the Po/BA-ph/GF composite laminates were stable up to 430 A degrees C in air. The systematic study of Po/BA-ph system could enrich the thermosetting resin/thermosetting resin systems in industrial applications. Meanwhile, the outstanding mechanical properties and thermal stabilities enable the Po/BA-ph/GF composite laminates to be further applied in the areas which require excellent mechanical properties and high temperature resistance.",

Tests were conducted under mode I (DCB), mode II (ENF) and mixed mode I/II (MMB) loading. Mode partitioning was performed using beam theory. The initiation failure point was defined both by the non-linearity point on the load/displacement curve and by the first acoustic signal. The main results concern test stability and fracture energies: crack propagation was unstable in adhesively bonded joint specimens under mode I loading but stable under mode II loads. This is in contrast to the expected behaviour and to that seen in composite interlaminar fracture. Fracture energies are much higher for the joints than for the composite specimens. The fracture envelopes obtained can now be used in the prediction of the failure loads for structural joints.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. The aim of this study was to examine the emission of acoustic signals from six commercially available fiber-reinforced composites (FRC) used in the frameworks of fixed partial dentures in material bending. Methods. FRC test specimens were made of six commercially available fiber products of polyethylene or glass and five light-curing resins. FRC test specimens were polymerized with a hand light-curing unit or with a light-curing oven. The flexural test for determination of ultimate flexural strength of test specimens (n=6) was based on the ISO 10477 standard after the specimens were stored in air or in water for two weeks. The acoustic emission (AE) signals were monitored during three-point loading test of the test specimens using a test with increasing loading levels until the specimens fractured. Results. Generally, stress level required for the AE activity initiation ranged from 107 MPa (Ribbond) to 579 MPa (everStick). The ultimate flexural strength of FRC specimens were higher, ranging from 132 to 764 MPa, being highest with everStick and Vectris FRC, and lowest with Ribbond FRC. ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference between the initiation of AE activity and the ultimate flexural strength according to the brand (p&lt;0.001), storing conditions (p&lt;0.001) and polymerization procedure (p&lt;0.001). AE activity and ultimate flexural strength correlated significantly (p&lt;0.010,r=0.887). Significance. The result of this study suggested that AE activity in FRC specimens started at a 19-32% lower stress level than occurred at final fracture. ?? 2003 Academy of Dental Materials.

So far, the shortened natural fibers were mainly used as the reinforcement, but textile products like yarn and fabrics can improve mechanical properties of composite in a significant way. The objective of the investigation is to develop a textile material suitable for composite reinforcement based on flax fibers. Pure flax fabric as well as hybrid fabrics containing flax fibers and chemical fibers: Kevlar, glass fibers, and poliimid have been developed in order to meet requirements related to mechanical properties of composites. The results of the mechan- ical tests confirmed suitability of the flax fabrics as a composite reinforcement. Due to strongly hydrophilic properties of pure flax, composites reinforced by the hybrid fabrics with polyaramide or glass fibers showed evidently better mechanical properties (even by about 80%). Chemical modification of flax fabric results in the improvement in adhesion between fibers and matrix. The results obtained within the work show that chemically treated flax fiber can serve as a valuable reinforcement for polymer matrix compos- ite material ensuring mechanical properties comparable to glass fibers.",

The tubes were pressurized up to 32. bar prior to impact. The pre-stressed glass fiber reinforced plastic tubes were damaged by applying low velocity impacts at different energy levels (5, 10 and 15. J). The damaged areas of the affected tubes were repaired with 2, 4 and 6 layers of glass/epoxy fabrics. The repaired tubes were then failed catastrophically by being subjected to monotonic internal burst tests based on ASTM D 1599-99 standards. Changes in the tubes&#039; burst pressures were recorded and the resulting damages on the tubes were studied. It was found that, for all the energy levels employed in this study, a six-layered patch repairing is suitable for the retrofitting of impact damaged tubes.",

          "abstract": "In this work the mechanical response to external applied loads of a new glass fibre reinforced endodontic post is simulated by finite element (FE) analysis of a bidimensional model. The new post has a cylindrical shape with a smooth conical end in order to adequately fit the root cavity, and to avoid edges that could act as undesired stress concentrators. Mechanical data obtained by three-point bending tests on some prototypes fabricated in the laboratory are presented and used in the FE model. Under various loading conditions, the resulting stress component fields are hence compared with those obtained in the case of two commercial endodontic posts (i.e. a cast metal post and a carbon fibre post) and with the response of a natural tooth. The gold cast post-and-core produces the greatest stress concentration at the post-dentin interface. On the other hand, fibre-reinforced composite posts do present quite high stresses in the cervical region due to their flexibility and also to the presence of a less stiff core material. The glass fibre composite shows the lowest peak stresses inside the root because its stiffness is much similar to dentin. Except for the force concentration at the cervical margin, the glass fibre composite post induces a stress field quite similar to that of the natural tooth. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Glass fiber-reinforced composite materials are attractive because their properties can be tailored to meet the specific needs of a variety of applications. The mechanical and thermal properties of a composite generally follow the rule of mixtures. As glass fiber is the major component at 70-75% by weight (50-60% by volume), selection of the correct glass product is critical. Glass fiber reinforcement is available in many forms, including continuous rovings, chopped fibers, fabrics, and nonwoven mats. In addition to form, selection of a reinforcement product involves choosing a glass type, chemistry on the glass (sizing) filament diameter, and tex. Glass formulation or type governs mechanical, thermal, and corrosion properties, whereas sizing protects the glass during handling and gives compatibility with the resin system. Filament diameter and strand tex are chosen to balance physical properties and manufacturing efficiency. A significant amount of tensile strength, up to 50%, may be lost from a pristine single filament to a multi-filament roving. To minimize this degradation, the utmost care and consistency must be exercised in the fiber forming process. This, coupled with selection of a high-performance glass formulation, enables use of composites in highly demanding applications, such as pressure vessels and ballistic armor. © 2012 The American Ceramic Society and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Continuous PPLSF and jute fibers were aligned unidirectionally in bi-layer arrangement and the hybrid composites were fabricated by compression molding process. Positive hybrid effect was observed for the composites due to hybridization. Increasing jute fiber loading showed a considerable increase in tensile and flexural properties of the hybrid composites as compared to treated PPLSF composites. Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM) of the fractured surfaces showed the nature of fiber/matrix interface. The impact strength of the hybrid composites were observed to be less compared to pure PPLSF composites. Addition of jute fibers to PPLSF and alkali treatment of the fibers has enhanced the storage and loss modulus of the hybrid composites. A positive shift of Tan. ?? peaks to higher temperature and reduction in the peak height of the composites was also observed. The composites with higher jute loading showed maximum damping behavior. Overall the hybridization was found to be efficient showing increased static and dynamic mechanical properties. A comparative study of properties of this hybrid composite with other hybrids made out of using natural/glass fibers is elaborated. Hybridization of alkali treated jute and PPLSF has resulted in enhanced properties which are comparable with other natural/glass fiber composites thus increasing the scope of application in manufacturing of light weight automotive parts. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The increasing impact energy was performed on two types of hybrid composite plates (glass-carbon/epoxy) until complete perforation of specimens. An energy profiling method, showing the relationship between impact energy and absorbed energy, was used together with load-deflection curves to determine the penetration and perforation thresholds of hybrid composites. The failure processes of damaged specimens for different impact energies were evaluated by comparing load-deflection curves and images of damaged samples taken from impacted sides and non-impacted sides. Cross-sections of damaged specimens were also inspected visually and discussed to assess the extent of damage, such as fiber fracture in layers, expansion of delaminations between adjacent layers. The perforation threshold of hybrid composite impacted from surface with carbon fibers was found approximately 30% higher than that of surface with glass fibers. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, interlaminar shear fatigue properties of glass/epoxy and carbon/epoxy composite tape material systems used in aircraft fatigue-critical applications are needed. The interlaminar shear fatigue material properties, essential for the development of the analysis methods able to capture fatigue delamination failure onset in composite structures, are presented in this work. S-N curves are generated based on custom short-beam shear (SBS) fatigue tests. The custom SBS test configurations ensure a consistent interlaminar shear failure mode. This work extends the recently developed methodology, published in Composites Science and Technology to characterize nonlinear shear properties of composite materials using digital image correlation (DIC) and finite element analysis, to fatigue loading. Test data sets used to develop the fatigue properties, include approximately 20 glass/epoxy and 30 carbon/epoxy SBS coupons. All tests were run in load control at 0.1 load ratio. To better understand material behavior under cyclic loading, surface shear strain was monitored using the DIC technique. Accurate shear stress approximation resulted in similar S-N curve shapes for the glass-fiber and the carbon-fiber composites. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

In this investigation study the mechanical properties of jute spun yarn/PLA tubular braided composite by pultrusion molding. The systems for jute spun yarn/PLA braided composite were described in the term of materials design, structure design and processing design. The intermediate materials were prepared by comingle technique. The braiding technique manufactured preform which had jute fiber diagonally oriented at certain angles with the glass fiber inserted into the braiding yarns along the longitudinal direction of braiding structure. The braided preforms were pulled through the heated die where consolidation flow took place due to reduced matrix viscosity. The pultrusion experiments were fabricated the tubular braided composite with varying the structure of braided preform and pultrusion molding condition. The configuration of intermediate material and the molding temperature are influenced to the mechanical properties of jute spun yarn/PLA tubular braided composite.

          "abstract": "Quasi-static penetration resistance of a composite structure represents the energy dissipating capacity of the structure under transverse loading without dynamic and rate effects. In this paper, a comparative study of the quasi-static penetration resistance behavior of S-2 Glass/SC-15, S-2 Glass/HDPE and E-Glass/HDPE composite systems with varying thicknesses, i.e., 1.4–8.4-mm, is presented using the Quasi-Static Punch Shear Test (QS-PST) methodology developed earlier. The penetration resistance behavior is usually presented by a series of force–displacement graphs at different support conditions, the integral of which is the energy dissipated by the composite during the quasi-static penetration at corresponding support conditions. The penetration energy varies with the diameter of the support span which is usually higher than the punch diameter, and also with the thickness of the composite laminate. During QS-PST experiments, a flat punch of diameter 7.6-mm with a range of support spans 8.89–50.8-mm has been used to obtain varying support span to punch diameter ratios (i.e., SPR=DS/DP=1.16, 1.33, 1.67, 2.00, 2.33, 2.67, etc.). In order to compare the penetration resistance behavior of three different material systems, the S-2 Glass/SC-15, S-2 Glass/HDPE and E-Glass/HDPE composites of identical layer counts are used and the S-2 Glass/SC15 composite system is considered as the baseline. Composite plate specimens are sectioned after the test and then dipped into an ink–alcohol solution to study the damage mechanisms at different SPRs. Non-linear penetration stiffness and an average penetration resistance force are defined to quantify the average penetration resistance of each material. S-2 Glass and E-Glass reinforced HDPE composite material showed lower stiffness, lower peak force, higher deflection, lower damage area, and lower energy dissipation as compared to the baseline. A detailed comparison of results is presented.",

          "abstract": "In the four years since the previous review [Vinson(1)] composite materials and their use in structures have grown and matured considerably. In addition to the continuous &amp; short fibre and particulate composites, there has been much progress in the areas of sheet moulding compounds, woven fabric &amp; three dimensional composites and braided composites employing many of the same fibre materials. New thermoplastic polymers show real promise and progress in metal matrix composites has been made. The analysis of composite material structures subjected to static, vibratory, impact, environmental and long time loading continues to progress. Important effects such as creep, viscoelasticity, damping, postbuckling behaviour and delamination are better understood. However, strength and failure criteria remain areas that need much further investigation and agreement. There has been a rapid increase in simpler-to-use computer codes that are available from the government and universities that ease structural-material analysis and provide more comprehensive descriptions of structural behaviour. In education concerning composite materials, new textbooks have appeared, more universities and organisations are offering courses, and there is a trend of migration of professors to those institutions where composite material research is emphasised. Technology transfer and export controls have had an increasing affect upon the composite materials community, particularly with regard to metal matrix composites. These manifest themselves in sponsored research, both at universities and international meetings. In the aerospace industry, all composite aircraft such as the Sikorsky ACAP helicopter have been developed. The Grumman X-29 Forward swept wing aircraft will fly soon. New turbine engines using more composite materials are under study, as well as increased use of composites in many aircraft and spacecraft vehicles. Composites in the automotive and leisure industries continue on the increase. With increased volume of use and better methods of computer assisted design, analysis and manufacturing, application of composites will extend to other areas such as mass transport. ?? 1986.",

Methods: Standard preparations on canines (N = 50, 10 per group) were made using a depth cutting bur (0.7 mm depth) designed for laminate veneer restorations. Forty indirect laminates using a highly filled polymeric material (Estenia) and 10 direct laminates (Quadrant Anterior Shine) were prepared according to the manufacturer&#039;s instructions. Bidirectional E-glass woven-fiber sheet (0.06 mm) (Everstick) was applied at different locations at the cementation interface. The control group received no fibers. The specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 1 month prior to fracture testing performed in a universal testing machine where the load was applied from the incisal direction at 137° (1 mm/min). Results: No significant differences were found between the five groups (P &gt; 0.01) (one-way ANOVA). While indirect laminate veneers showed mean fracture strength of 247 ± 47 N, direct laminate veneers revealed 239 ± 104 N. The use of E-glass fibers at the cementation interface at different locations did not increase the fracture strength significantly (286-313 N) (P &gt; 0.01). Failure analysis showed mainly cohesive fracture of the veneer restoration (20/50) and adhesive failure between the cementation interface and the laminate with fiber exposure (19/50) covering more than half of the restorations. Significance: Direct and indirect resin composite laminate veneers showed comparable mean fracture strengths. The use of E-glass woven-fiber sheet at the cementation interface did not increase the fracture strength of the polymeric laminate veneers. © 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.",

It was observed that the addition of two and three layer of glass fiber can improve the tensile strength by a factor of 2.34 and 4.13 respectively.

It was established that GMT-PP is superior to LGF-PP when fracture toughness and energy are considered under both static and dynamic conditions. The failure mode and sequence of the composites were determined from acoustic emission (AE) analysis by relating AE signal characteristics (amplitude and energy) to the individual failure events. GMT-PP failed in a stepwise manner related to the successive breakdown of the GF mat incorporated. This resulted in a more extended damage zone than for LGF-PP. Size and shape of the damage zone were estimated by mapping the located AE events and by considering infrared thermographic (IT) pictures showing heat evolution in the crack tip region. The damage zone size deduced from AE analysis proved to be lower than that obtained from IT studies. This was attributed to differences in the damage assessment: AE informs us about the development of the full damage zone at every stage of the loading, while IT is sensitive for the process zone (being a part of the damage zone) in the crack growth range. It may be stated that the energy-related toughness of GMT-PP is superior to that of the LGF-PP at the same reinforcement content. ?? 1995.",

Scanning electron microscopy study revealed a brittle fracture for treated fiber composite, while significant fiber pull-out is observed for the untreated fiber composite. Higher tensile and hardness properties, higher glass transition and thermal decomposition temperatures, and low water absorption properties are obtained for alkaline-treated composites. Enhanced interface bonding due to improved adhesion has helped in the formation of covalent bonds at the fiber-matrix interface, resulting in superior tensile, thermal, and water absorption properties of the treated fiber composite. Flexural and impact properties are higher for untreated fiber composite. This is due to the weak fiber-matrix interface and a differential strain in fiber and matrix. The weak interface has provided an energy absorbing mechanism and enhanced the impact energy absorption capacity. The tensile strength of CF composite is very much comparable with that of sisal fiber composite. The tensile and flexural properties are higher for the woven CF composites than those of short CF composites. But the impact properties are superior for short fiber composites compared to the woven fiber composites. Increased number of interfaces for the short fiber composites has contributed for the cushioning effect and an enhanced energy absorbing mechanism. Water absorption properties have improved for the treated fiber composites due to formation of a strong interface. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, thermoplastics incorporated with particulate fillers have been gained high interest. To improve the mechanical properties of the natural particle reinforced polymer plastics, hybrid structure has been applied on the composite combining natural particle with stronger synthetic fibers. However, the reinforcing mechanism of the hybrid composite is quite complicated. Experiments on it may become time consuming and cost prohibitive. Therefore, researchers are interested in studying variable models to predict the elastic properties of the composites. In this study, glass short fiber/wood particle/pp hybrid composites were prepared by injection molding process at a fixed reinforcement to matrix ratio of 51:49. 4 kinds of hybrid specimens with glass fiber/wood particle ratios of 41:10, 31:20, 21:30 and 11:40 were fabricated. The effect of hybridization content on the mechanical properties of the composites was evaluated based on tensile test. Theoretically, the elastic modulus of hybrid composites was predicted by using the rule of hybrid mixtures (RoHM) equation and classical lamination theory (CLT) and the accuracy of the two estimation models has been discussed. Results showed that it can be considered the hybridization of wood powder into glass/PP composite could contribute to a similar high elastic modulus with high green degree. On the other hand, the fiber orientation factor, fiber length distribution factor, powder dispersion factor were very important factors and need to be considered in the prediction model.",

          "abstract": "The damage mechanisms in two structurally different glass mat reinforced polypropylene materials were studied. In situ microscopy was applied during the tensile testing of thin notched sheets. Micrographs of the damage processes in the two materials are presented. The major points of damage initiation were transversely oriented fibers and fiber bundles. In the swirled mat material, cracks grew along the fiber bundles; crack formation and growth was relatively unaffected by macroscopical stress concentration. In the short fiber material, crack growth occurred at the notch. In both materials the maximum load was determined by the fibers oriented in the longitudinal direction. The different damage mechanisms were interpreted in terms of damage zone size. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.",

(0/90/0/90)s oriented cross-ply E-glass/epoxy laminates studied were manufactured and all of the material parameters of laminated composite materials were measured experimentally. The impact testing was conducted with a specially developed vertical drop-weight testing machine. Impact tests were performed at impactor masses of 135 and 2600 g and an impact velocity of 3 m/s. The studies were carried out on plate dimensions of 150 mm × 150 mm, 150 mm × 100 mm and 150 mm × 50 mm with two opposite sides clamped and the other two free and impact load applied at the center of each plate. A numerical simulation was performed using 3DIMPACT transient dynamic finite element analysis code for calculating stresses and contact forces of the composite plates during impact along with a failure analysis for predicting the threshold of impact damage and initiation of delaminations. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Sandwich composite are used in numerous structural applications, with demonstrated weight savings over conventional metals and solid composite materials. The increasing use of sandwich composites in defense structures, particularly those which may be exposed to shock loading, demands for a thorough understanding of their response to suc highly transient loadings. In order to fully utilize their potential in such extreme conditions, design optimization of the skin and core materials are desirable. The present study is performed for a novel type of sandwich material, TRANSONITE?? made by pultrusion of 3-D woven 3WEAVE?? E-glass fiber composites skin preforms integrally stitched to polyisocyanurate TRYMERTM 200L foam core. The effect of core stitching density on the transient response of three simply supported sandwich panels loaded in a shock tube is experimentally studied in this work. The experimental program is focused on recording dynamic transient response by high-speed camera and post-mortem evaluation of imparted damage. The obtained experimental results reveal new important features of the transient deformation, damage initiation and progression and final failure of sandwich composites with unstitched and stitched foam cores. The theoretical study includes full 3-D dynamic transient analysis of displacement, strain and stress fields under experimentally recorded surface shock pressure, performed with the use of 3-D MOSAIC analysis approach. The obtained theoretical and experimental results for the transient central deflections in unstitched and two stitched foam core sandwiches are mutually compared. The comparison results reveal large discrepancies in the case of unstitched sandwich, much smaller discrepancies in the case of intermediate stitching density, and excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental results for the sandwich with the highest stitching density. The general conclusion is that further comprehensive experimental and theoretical studies are required in order to get a thorough understanding of a very complex behavior of composite sandwiches under shock wave loading. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A new manufacturing method combining AFP and UV in-situ curing was presented in this paper to manufacture glass fiber reinforced composites for large scale composite structures, especially with thick curing depth. A robot-based fiber placement machine integrating UV-LED for the in-situ curing was developed and a flat panel was fabricated with this method. UV transmission characteristic of single composite layer was obtained and preliminary researches about the effects of UV exposure on laminate performance have been conducted. The results showed that laminates fabricated by the in-situ curing process shows better interlaminar properties when the degree of polymerization is about 67.7% for the first cured layer with the incident UV irradiance. Finally, some key issues concerning the process are discussed.",

          "abstract": "To assess the fracture resistance and failure mode of fiber reinforced composite (FRC) cusp-replacing restorations in premolars. Forty-five extracted sound upper premolars were randomly divided into three groups. Identical MOD cavities with simulated buccal cusp fracture and height reduction of the palatal cusp were prepared. In Group A two layers of resin impregnated woven continuous FRC (EverStick Net) were applied. In Group B one layer of unidirectional continuous FRC (EverStick) was used. In Group C no fibers were applied (control). Subsequently, all teeth were restored with resin composite (Clearfil Photo Posterior), subjected to thermocycling (6000??5-55 ??C) and static load tests. Load until fracture was registered for each tooth. Simultaneously, fracture propagation was monitored using acoustic emission analysis (AE). Failure modes were visually assessed. Weibull analysis revealed a characteristic strength and Weibull modulus (m) at 2364.8 N for Group A (m=8.9), 2437.9 N for Group B (m=5.9) and 2160.3 N for Group C (m=13.6). Fracture loads were not significantly different (ANOVA, p&gt;0.05). Teeth with FRC showed less fractures below the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) (38% and 23% for Groups A and B, respectively) than teeth without FRC (93%) (chi-square, p&lt;0.05). The control group showed the least AE energy signals. The results suggest that glass FRC does not increase fracture load of premolars with cusp-replacing restorations. However, FRC has a beneficial effect on the failure mode. Woven fibers give more consistent results than unidirectional fibers. ?? 2004 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To estimate the wear resistance of carbon fiber phenolic composite, wear tests were performed at several pressures and velocities.

          "abstract": "Hybrid composites of glass and banana fiber (obtained from the pseudo stem of Musa sapientum) in polyester matrix, are subjected to dynamic mechanical analysis over a range of temperature and three different frequencies. The effect of temperature on the storage modulus (E&#039;), loss modulus (E&#039;&#039;), and loss factor or damping efficiency (tan {delta}) is determined. All the properties are compared with those of the neat polyester samples and the un-hybridized composites. The effects of the layering pattern of the two fibers on the ultimate viscoelastic behavior of the composites are also investigated. Composites are prepared with banana as the surface layer and glass as the surface layer and also as an intimate mixture of glass and banana. At temperatures above T g,, the storage modulus values are found to decrease even with the addition of glass fiber for the geometry where glass is the core material. The value of the storage modulus of the composites with the above mentioned geometry is found to be different, above and below Tg, the value above Tg being lower than that below Tg unlike in unhybridized composite. The loss modulus curves and the damping peaks are found to be flattened by the addition of glass. Layering pattern or the geometry of the composites is found to have a profound effect on the dynamic properties of the composite. An intimately mixed composite is found to have the highest storage modulus values in all compositions. The values are consistent with the results of tensile strength. The tan {delta} curve is found to be affected by the layering pattern followed and gives insight into the interaction in the material. The dielectric behavior of the composites are also found to be dependent on the glass fiber volume fraction as well as the layering pattern employed.",

Characterization techniques such as electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and Mossbauer spectroscopies, thermal analysis, acid dissolution, silanation, and density fractionation have been used as experimental probes, and reveal a range of information relating to the glass phases from the macro, through the micro, to the nano-structural levels. Complex inter- and intra-particle heterogeneity in ash is observable not only in bulk chemical and mineralogical analyses but also at the molecular level in the constituent glasses. Remarkable relationships between ash particle size, density and glass composition have been observed and lead to a new proposed mechanism for ash morphogenesis based on temperature-viscosity effects in the mineral precursor melts in the boiler flame. A glass-ceramic model for fly ash particle structure is proposed and discussed in terms of phase relations in the CaO-SiO2-A120 3 and FeO-Fe2O3-A120 3- SiO2 systems, modification of the aluminosilicate glasses by alkali and alkaline earth metal cations, and microheterogeneity involving glass devitrification and phase separation.",

Comparison between predictions based on the F-T model and the experimental fiber orientation show that the model over predicts the rate of fiber reorientation. Rheological measurements of the stress growth functions show that the stress overshoot phenomenon approaches a steady state at a similar strain as the fiber microstructure, at roughly 50 units. However, fiber orientation measurements suggest that a steady state is not reached as the fiber orientation continues to slowly evolve, even up to 200 strain units. The addition of a &quot;slip&quot; parameter to the F-T model improved the model predictions of the fiber orientation and rheological stress growth functions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "In recent years, some researchers have studied about shape memory alloy composites (SMACs) which consist of a shape memory alloy (SMA) reinforcement and polymer or metal matrix. In particular, considerable attention has been paid to the creation of internal stress in a matrix of SMAC. Internal stress in a matrix can be created when a deformed SMA fiber recovers its original shape in a composite. On the other hand, deformation of the composite appears when internal stress is created in matrix. Therefore, an interaction exists between the creation of internal stress in the matrix and deformation of the composite. The main purpose of the present research is to investigate the effect of fiber volume fraction and aspect ratio ( l / d : length divided by diameter of fiber) on the creation of internal stress in the matrix and deformation for a short-fiber SMA reinforced composite (S-SMAC) under thermal loadings. In the present paper, a constitutive relation of S-SMAC is proposed on the basis of the shear-lag model. Then, the effects of fiber volume fraction and aspect ratio on the creation of internal stress in the matrix and deformation of the composite are investigated by using the proposed constitutive relation for S-SMAC under thermal loadings. The main conclusions are as follows: composite shrinkage and compressive residual stress in the matrix increase with increasing aspect ratio and fiber volume fraction after heating. Also, the composite strain history and residual stress history in the matrix are different according to the fiber volume fraction and aspect ratio during heating. The change of aspect ratio has a small effect on the creation of internal stress in the matrix and deformation of the composite. The performances of S-SMAC come close to that of long-fiber SMA reinforced composite (L-SMAC) when the aspect ratio is &gt;25. Also, residual stresses in the fiber and matrix before heating influence the creation of internal stress in the matrix and deformation of the composite during heating.",

The success of the strengthening intervention largely depends on adequate bond between FRP sheets and the concrete substrate. In recent years, techniques to anchor FRP sheets in applications where sheets must develop strength in a short length have been proposed. One of these techniques includes use of FRP anchors embedded into the concrete substrate and forming part of the composite strengthening system.

This paper presents the results of experi- mental and analytical studies on the performance of concrete columns externally wrapped with carbon and glass FRPC sheets. Concrete columns were wrapped with three different types of FRP composites: two carbon and one glass. The confined and unconfined (control) specimens were loaded in uniaxial compression. Axial load and axial and lateral strains were obtained to evaluate stress-strain behavior, ultimate strength, stiffness, and ductility of the wrapped specimens. Results show that external confinement of concrete by FRP composite sheets can significantly enhance the strength, ductility, and energy absorption capacity of the concrete specimens. An analytical model to predict the entire stress-strain relationship of concrete specimens wrapped with FRP composite sheets was developed. The proposed model consists of two distinct parts. In the first part, the behavior is similar to that of plain concrete, since lateral expansion of the confined concrete is insignificant. The second region, which is mainly dependent on the stiffness of the FRP composite, is recognized in which the FRP wrap is fully activated. Comparison between the experimental and analytical results indi- cates that the model provides satisfactory predictions of the stress- strain response. Results from a series of experimental tests on concrete confined with FRP sheets available in the literature are also compared favorably with results obtained by the model.",

Shear stress values for IPP/GF melts are higher at the same shear rate and temperature. Variation of melt viscosity and melt elasticity with fiber concentration and shear stress or shear rate are also illustrated. Melt viscosity increases with fiber loading, while melt elasticity parameters such as die-swell and first normal stress difference decrease for both systems. For IPP/GF composite melts the viscosity values are higher, the die-swell and first normal stress difference values are lower compared to IPP/JF composites melts.

Two fiber geometries, namely [±45°]4 and [0/90°]2s stitch bonded glass fibers were studied. The results revealed that even low energy impact could seriously impair the tensile properties of [±45°]4 composites. For the [0/90°]2s glass fiber composites, a critical impact energy was found. Below this energy level the tensile properties were hardly affected by the impact but above it the tensile properties reduced with increasing energy. Low velocity impact also reduced the fatigue lives of the composites and this reduction could be related to the degradation in tensile strength. By normalizing the fatigue stress against the post-impact residual tensile strength of the composite, it was found that for each fiber geometry a single S–N curve could be drawn, which encompassed both undamaged and impacted samples. This implies that fatigue lifetimes of impact damaged composites can be predicted from measurement of the residual tensile strength of impacted specimens and the S–N curve of undamaged samples.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between post and core build-up materials on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored with different onlay restorations. METHODS: 60 mandibular molars were endodontically treated and divided into three experimental groups that received one of the following onlay restorations: gold onlays, glass ceramic onlays (Empress I), or resin composite onlays (Gradia). Half of the specimens in each group received a fiber post (n=10). Two controls groups (n=10) were included: one group composed of sound mandibular molars, and the second group was composed of endodontically treated unrestored molars. Fracture tests were carried out by applying axial load using a universal loading machine until fracture. All fractured specimens were fractographically examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison tests (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that restoration of endodontically treated teeth with gold onlays improved fracture resistance when compared to glass ceramic or resin composite onlays. The presence of a fiber post significantly improved (P&lt;0.045) fracture resistance of gold onlays from 2271 to 2874N while it did not influence the performance of the other two groups. Fractographic analyses revealed that the presence of fiber post resulted in more restorable fractures due to better stress distribution of the applied load. All onlay systems resulted in significant improvement of the fracture resistance compared to unrestored teeth (711N) but neither of them resulted in restoring the fracture resistance to match that of sound teeth (3212 N).",

          "abstract": "Hybrid composite stack, especially FRP/Ti assembly, is considered as an innovative structural configuration for manufacturing the key load-bearing components favoring energy saving in the aerospace industry. Several applications require mechanical drilling for finishing hybrid composite structures. The drilling operation of hybrid FRP/Ti composite, however, represents the most challenging task in modern manufacturing sectors due to the disparate natures of each constituent involved and the complexity to control tool-material interfaces during one single cutting shot. Special issues may arise from the severe subsurface damage, excessive interface consumption, rapid tool wear, etc. In this paper, a rigorous review concerning the state-of-the-art results and advances on drilling solutions of hybrid FRP/Ti composite was presented by referring to the wide comparisons among literature analyses. The multiple aspects of cutting responses and physical phenomena generated when drilling these materials were precisely addressed. A special focus was made on the material removal modes and tool wear mechanisms dominating the bi-material interface consumption (BIC) with respect of investigating strategies used. The key conclusions from the literature review were drawn to point out the potential solutions and limitations to be necessarily overcome for reaching both (i) enhanced control of drilling operation, and (ii) better finish quality of FRP/Ti parts.",

By means of a micromechanical model, it is possible to determine from the fragmentation lenghts a measure of the interfacial shear strength between the fiber and the matrix. The AE technique also provides a means for characterizing the statistics of fiber strength, particularly for lengths less than 100 fiber diameters. In contrast to existing optical techniques, the acoustic measurements can be automated and are usable with non-transparent matrices. The technique is demonstrated with E-glass fibers embedded in two epoxy blends. A comparison is made of the statistics for the fragment aspect ratios and resulting interfacial shear strength values determined by acoustic emission and optical techniques. Good agreement is found between the results obtained from these two measurement methods. © 1989.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Glass-fiber-reinforced resin composites for the fabrication of esthetic single crowns and fixed partial dentures have been developed recently. However, little data on the clinical outcome of such restorations have been published. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of crowns and fixed partial dentures made from the glass-fiber-reinforced resin composite material Targis/Vectris. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Between 1995 and 1997, 39 patients were treated with 67 single crowns and 83 fixed partial dentures. Twenty-five crowns and 28 fixed partial dentures were cemented with temporary cement, while 42 crowns and 55 fixed partial dentures were cemented with either zinc-phosphate cement or glass-ionomer cement. RESULTS: In September 2001, 57 restorations in 17 patients were still in function. The three-year survival rate calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method was 58.8% for all restorations. However, after this time, it was 37.5% for crowns and 59.9% for fixed partial dentures cemented with temporary cement, and 55.1% for crowns and 67.9% for fixed partial dentures cemented with zinc phosphate or glass ionomer. The differences between the restoration groups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Glass-fiber-reinforced crowns and fixed partial dentures made with the glass-fiber-reinforced resin composite material Targis/Vectris showed a lower survival rate than that published for metal-ceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures. Therefore, the use of this material for the fabrication of single crowns or fixed partial dentures as permanent restorations cannot be recommended.",

In this study, glass fiber, and carbon fiber as a type reinforcement and epoxy as a matrix material were used to fabricate composite materials. In an attempt to increase the conduction noise absorption, carbon nanotubes were grown on the surface of glass fibers and carbon fibers. A microstrip line with characteristic impedance of 50 ?? in connection with network analyzer was used to measure the conduction noise absorption. In comparing a glass fiber/epoxy composite with a GF-CNT/Ep composite, it was demonstrated that the CNTs significantly influence the noise absorption property mainly due to increase in electric conductivity. In the carbon fiber composites, however, the effectiveness of CNTs on the degree of electric conductivity is negligible, resulting in a small change in reflection and transmission of an electromagnetic wave. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The low S2 microfibril angle resulted in fiber bundles with high tensile strength (960 MPa) decreasing to 850 MPa after defibration due to degradation of non cellulosic components.

At a site off Bermuda, most of the particles passed GF/D and QM-A filters. At both this site and the site of the JGOFS North Atlantic bloom experiment, the majority was retained on GF/F filters but a significant fraction passed through to be retained by Anopore filters ( similar to 30% of total). This fraction increased at and below the base of the euphotic zone. For the North Atlantic experiment, particles passing GF/F filters also accounted for up to 60% of the NH sub(4) super(+) and 80% of the NO sub(3) super(-) uptake into particle uptake. Uptake integrated over the upper 60 m, however, was not significantly underestimated by the GF/F filters.",

Laser optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, digital temperature measurement system and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope were used to investigate the microstructure, wear mechanism and chemical nature change of the studied materials. The results revealed that the coefficients of friction under oil field water lubricated condition were slightly lower than those under dry sliding condition for the studied materials, in which glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 66 composite exhibited the lowest coefficient of friction. The quenched ductile iron showed the lowest wear volume among the studied materials under both dry and lubricating sliding conditions. The wear loss of glass-fiber/polyamide 66 composite was much higher under lubricating condition than that under dry sliding condition, and much higher than those of as-cast and quenched ductile iron, which was attributed to the combination of thermal deformation, degradation and micro-ploughing.",

The results of experiments, implemented at five different low-temperature levels ranging from 0℃ to −40℃, were evaluated in comparison with room temperature tests. Joints exhibited relatively higher load-carrying capacities with increased stiffness by decreasing temperature. In order to examine tightening torque effects at each temperature condition, bolts were fastened under M = 6 Nm and M = 0 Nm (finger tightened) torques. As expected, a greater amount of bearing load could be carried by the joints with pre-tightened fasteners. Furthermore, any reduction in temperature is observed to lift the effectiveness of tightening torque on the joint strength. Regardless of the temperature exposed, bearing mode, the most desirable failure type in mechanically fastened joints was monitored as the main failure mode. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

Interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) by short-beam testing and ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques were applied to monitor fungal degradation of E-glass fiber reinforced polymer composites. Since the FRP material was designed for use as reinforcement with wood, the FRP material was exposed to two common wood decay fungi, a brown rot fungus and a white rot fungus. Light and scanning electron microscopy indicated that both wood decay fungi actively grew and penetrated into the FRP material, especially in high-void content areas. The reduction in apparent ILSS of the brown rot-exposed FRP material was not statistically significant at a 95% confident level. A weak relationship between decay exposure and ILLS strength loss, however, was observed. The experimental results indicate that both mechanical property evaluation techniques (ILSS and NDE) may be sensitive enough to detect the effects of fungal degradation in FRP materials. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

          "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the rigidity of different post materials (titanium versus glass fiber reinforced composite [FRC]) on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth (ETT). Method: Forty-eight caries-free maxillary central incisors were randomly assigned to six groups (n = 8). After endodontic treatment, teeth of four groups were flattened 2 mm above and two groups at the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). As control, specimens of one group received neither composite build-up nor post, and teeth were left empty (E). In another group only a resin composite build-up was placed (C). In two groups, both titanium and FRC posts were inserted. One group with titanium (2/T) and FRC (2/FRC) post received a 2 mm deep ferrule preparation. For one group with titanium (0/T) and FRC (0/FRC) post no ferrule design was provided. All-ceramic crowns were adhesively luted on all specimens. Specimens were exposed to thermomechanical loading and finally statically loaded until failure. Results: The median fracture load values (min-max) were: E = 317 (242-404); C = 387 (335-475); 0/FRC = 352 (0-440); 2/FRC = 502 (326-561); 0/T = 420 (0-548), 2/T = 517 (416-653). Statistically significant differences were computed between E, C, 2/FRC, 0/T and 2/T; between C, 2/FRC and 2/T; between 0/FRC, 2/FRC and 2/T; between 0/T and 2/T regarding maximum fracture load. Significance: Fracture resistance of ETT is not influenced by the rigidity of the post material. The combination of ferrule preparation and endodontic post results in higher load resistance after TML than any other build-up design. ?? 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.",

The present ivestigation is focused on the influence of the glass fiber surface treatment on the interlaminar fracture toughness of unidirectional laminates. Glass fibers with two different fiber surface treatments have been investigated, fiber surface treatment was carried out by using a polyethylene or silane coupling agent in combination with modifying agents. The glass fibers were embedded in the brittle epoxy matrix. Mode I, mode II, and mixedmode I/II tests were performed in order to determine critical strain energy release rates. Double cantilever beam (DCB), end-notched flexure (ENF), and mixed-mode flexure (MMF) specimens were used. For both types of fiber surface treatment about the same values of mode I initiation fracture toughness GICinit were obtained. It was observed that in mode I interlaminar crack growth in the DCB test for the composite sized by polyethylene, the crack propagation is accompanied by extensive fiber bridging. For both fiber surface treatments interlaminar fracture toughness increases considerably with increasing of crack length. For the fiber surface treatment with the silane coupling agent, the value of mode II initiation fracture toughness GIICinit was about 2.5-times higher in comparison with that of a composite sized by polyethylene.

          "abstract": "From a selection of four kinds of post and core systems, including a fiber post and composite resin core, the purpose of this study was to determine the most effective system for the restoration of endodontically treated teeth with 0 mm of coronal tooth structure. For experimental abutment teeth, typical human maxillary central incisor teeth were modeled using bovine mandibular incisor teeth. By means of a static loading test, the four restoration systems were evaluated and compared in terms of failure load and failure mode. Further, by means of a cyclic loading test, these systems were assessed in terms of durability.\r\nFor fiber post and composite resin core, it excelled from the standpoints of failure load and failure mode, and fared favorably too in durability after cyclic loading test. For composite resin post-and-core, it also showed excellent results for both failure load and failure mode in static loading test, but durability significantly decreased with cyclic loading. Taken together, the fiber post and composite resin core was found to be most effective from the standpoints of failure load, failure mode, and durability.",

The composite specimens were fabricated by filament winding. Surface coatings embedded in composite laminates were produced. The composite substrates were grit blasted to promote adhesion of the molten aluminum particles. It was found that adhesion increased significantly when the composite substrate was lightly grit blasted, with no adhesion on smooth composite surfaces. The number of passes of the flame spray torch was varied to change the coating thickness and uniformity over the substrate. The electrical resistance of the coatings was measured to assess the suitability of a coating as a conductor. It was found that uniform, electrically conductive coatings were produced with a minimum of two torch passes. Optical images were captured to characterize the coating microstructure and thickness. This investigation did not reveal any visible evidence of damage to the composite substrate. To assess possible degradation effects from the grit blasting and flame spraying processes, the tube specimens were subjected to mechanical testing by applying internal pressurization with hydraulic oil. The tests indicated that the grit blasting and flame spraying processes must be carefully executed to mitigate degradation of the strength of the composite material substrate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

Hydroxyapatite (HA) and P-glass mixed powder slurries were coated on the ZrO2 substrate, and subsequently heat-treated to obtain CaP- and P-glass composite coatings. The effects of glass composition (x=0.3, 0.4, 0.5mol), mixing ratio of glass to HA (30%, 40%, 50%wt/wt), and heat treatment temperature (800??C, 900??C, 1000??C) on the coating properties were investigated. After heat treatment, additional calcium phosphates, i.e., dicalcium phosphate (DCP) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP), were crystallized, resulting in the formation of triphasic calcium phosphates (HA-TCP-DCP) surrounded by a glass phase. The relative amounts of the crystalline phases varied with coating variables. The higher heat treatment temperature and glass amount, and the lower CaO content in the glass composition rendered the composite coatings to retain the higher amounts of TCP and DCP while the initial HA decreased. These appearance of additional crystalline phases and reduction of HA amount were attributed to the combined effects, i.e., the melting-crystallization of P-glass and the reaction between glass liquid phase and HA powder during thermal treatment. As a result of the glass phase in the composite coatings, their microstructures became much denser when compared to the pure HA coating. In particular, a completely dense structure was obtained at coating conditions with large amount of glass addition (50wt%) at the glass composition of lower CaO content (0.3mol CaO), and the following heat treatment above 800??C for 2h. As a result, the adhesion strengths of the composite coating layers were significantly improved when compared to the pure HA coating. The highest strength of the composite coating was ???40MPa, an improvement of ???80% with respect to the pure HA coating. The composite coatings showed much higher dissolution rates than the pure HA coating due to the newly formed crystallines (TCP and DCP) and the remaining glass phase. The osteoblast-like cells grew and spread actively on the composite coating samples. The proliferation numbers and alkaline phosphate (ALP) activities of the cells on the composite coatings were improved by ???30-40% when compared to Thermanox control and ZrO2 substrate, and were comparable to the pure HA coating. These findings suggested that the CaP and P-glass composites are potentially useful for hard tissue coating system, due to their morphological and mechanical integrity, enhanced bioactivity, and favorable responses to the osteoblast-like cells. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The explorations of truly flexible composite-based flexible thermoelectric devices (See, K. C.; et al.

Here we report an example using a scalable solution-phase deposition method to coat thermoelectric nanocrystals onto the surface of flexible glass fibers. Our investigation of the thermoelectric properties yields high performance comparable to the state of the art from the bulk crystals and proof-of-concept demonstration also suggests the potential of wrapping the thermoelectric fibers on the industrial pipes to improve the energy efficiency.",

The volume percentage of filler materials in the composite was varied, silicon carbide was varied from 5 to 10% whereas graphite was kept constant at 5%. The excellent wear resistance was obtained with glass-epoxy containing fillers. The transfer film formed on the counter surface was confirmed to be effective in improving the wear characteristics of filled G-E composites. The influence of applied load is more on specific wear rate compared to the other two wear parameters. The worn surfaces of composites were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the probable wear mechanisms. It was found that in the early stage of wear, the fillers contribution is significant.

Visco elastic behaviour of the polymer, which is mainly responsible for the sound absorption, is altered by the addition of short fibers. Addition of high modulus fibers to the base polymer matrix reduces the damping characteristics of the composite. Material damping affects the hysteresis heating as well as the ability to absorb vibration during service. Dynamic mechanical analysis carried out on unreinforced Nylon 6/6, 20% short glass and 20% carbon fiber reinforced Nylon 6/6 gear materials indicates the reduction of damping factor due to the incorporation of fibers. Injection molded spur gears made of unreinforced and reinforced materials were tested for durability in a power absorption type gear test rig. Surface temperature of the test gears and noise generated near the gear mesh region were continuously measured and monitored using a personal computer based data acquisition system. Test results indicate that the reinforced gears generate more gear mesh noise than unreinforced gears. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one glass fiber-reinforced composite IFPDs were made to replace one missing maxillary or mandibular tooth. The frameworks were made only with parallel fibers in 19 restorations (group 1) and built with parallel and woven fibers modifying the design of the pontic element in 22 IFPDs (group 2) according to the manufacturer&#039;s instructions. All restorations were evaluated by color match, marginal discoloration, secondary caries, surface texture, marginal adaptation, fracture, and postoperative sensitivity. RESULTS: Three partial adhesive-cohesive veneering composite fractures occurred in the pontic element in group 1 after 3, 4, and 8 months, respectively. One cohesive fracture occurred in an abutment in group 2 after 46 months. Group 1 showed a 16% fracture failure rate; group 2 showed a 5% failure rate. However, no statistical difference was detected between the groups. IFPDs received the highest score at the following rates: color match 71%, marginal discoloration 96%, secondary caries 99%, surface texture 88%, marginal adaptation 98%, fracture 90%, and postoperative sensitivity 100%. Statistical analysis indicated significant deterioration of color match from baseline to last recall. CONCLUSION: There were nonsignificantly fewer fractures of the veneering composite with the modified design of the framework than with the conventional design. Repair of the fractured veneer of IFPDs may lengthen the lifespan of the restorations, but it is advisable only for slight damage.",

          "abstract": "Tensile properties of a cross-ply glass-ceramic composite were investigated by conducting fracture, creep, and fatigue experiments at both room temperature and high temperatures in air. The composite consisted of a barium magnesium aluminosilicate (BMAS) glass-ceramic matrix reinforced with SiC fibers with a SiC/BN coating, The material exhibited retention of most tensile properties up to 1200 degrees C, Monotonic tensile fracture tests produced ultimate strengths of 230-300 MPa with failure strains of similar to 1%, and no degradation in ultimate strength was observed at 1100 degrees and 1200 degrees C. In creep experiments at 1100 degrees C, nominal steady-state creep rates in the 10(-9) s(-1) range were established after a period of transient creep. Tensile stress rupture experiments at 1100 degrees and 1200 degrees C lasted longer than one year at stress levels above the corresponding proportional limit stresses for those temperatures. Tensile fatigue experiments were conducted in which the maximum applied stress was slightly greater than the proportional limit stress of the matrix, and, in these experiments, the composite survived 10(5) cycles without fracture at temperatures up to 1200 degrees C. Microscopic damage mechanisms were investigated by TEM, and microstructural observations of tested samples were correlated with the mechanical response, The SiC/BN fiber coatings effectively inhibited diffusion and reaction at the interface during high-temperature testing, The BN layer also provided a weak interfacial bond that resulted in damage-tolerant fracture behavior, However, oxidation of near-surface SiC fibers occurred during prolonged exposure at high temperatures, and limited oxidation at fiber interfaces was observed when samples were dynamically loaded above the proportional limit stress, creating micro-cracks along which oxygen could diffuse into the interior of the composite.",

It is concluded that while the z-yarns may be effective in limiting the delamination damage at low loads and at low rates of impact, at high loads and high loading rates delamination continues to be the dominant failure mode in 3D woven composites.

There is considerable fiber attrition during injection molding; the fiber lengths are reduced to average values of 0.4 to 0.8 mm for thses two samples. Also during injection molding of the test sample, partial molecular alignment of the matrix (polypropylene) occurs which supplements the reinforcement of the matrix due to the aligned glass fibers (30 percent by weight) present in the composite sample. The stiffness and strength of these samples do not reflect the effects of fiber lengths since most of the fibers are of very small length in the molded specimen and also since the sample with longer fibers has a non-uniform distribution of fibers. While the interfacial shear strength does not appear to play a significant role in determining stiffness, it turns out to be extremely important in controlling strength, particularly at the higher test temperatures. The room temperature impact strength is high for the sample containing relatively longer fibers of average length around 0.8 mm in which fiber dispersion is non-uniform and fiber agglomerates are present. Acoustic emission data shows that debonding and fiber pull-out are the main contributors to sample toughness; this observation is supported by scanning electron micrographs of the fracture surfaces.",

One of the remaining problems is the analysis of the AE signals in order to identify the most critical damage mechanisms. In this work, unsupervised pattern recognition analyses (fuzzy C-means clustering) associated with a principal component analysis are the tools that are used for the classification of the monitored AE events. A cluster analysis of AE data is achieved and the resulting clusters are correlated to the damage mechanisms of the material under investigation. After being validated on model samples composed of unidirectional fiber-matrix composites, this method is applied to actual composites such as glass fiber/polyester cross-ply composites and sheet molding compound (SMC). Furthermore, AE signals generated by heterogeneous materials are not stationary. Thus, time-scale methods are used to determine new relevant descriptors to be introduced in the classification process in order to improve the characterization and the discrimination of the damage mechanisms. Continuous and discrete wavelet transforms are applied on typical damage mechanisms AE signals of glass fiber/polyester composites such as matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding. Time-scale descriptors are defined from these wavelet analyses. They provide a better discrimination of damage mechanisms than some time-based descriptors. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Friction and wear tests were carried out using pin-on-disc configuration under dry sliding contact conditions. In the present work, tribological characteristics of CGRP composite were measured in three principal sliding directions relative to the chopped glass mat orientation in the composites. These are parallel direction (P), anti-parallel direction (AP), and normal direction (N). The effect of various experimental test parameters such as applied loads, sliding distances, and sliding speeds was studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is performed on worn surfaces to categorize the wear failure mechanisms. Friction and wear results are presented as a function of normal loads, sliding velocities, and sliding distances for P-, AP-, and N-orientations. The results of friction and wear, in general, are strongly influenced by all the test parameters. The highest wear rate is observed when sliding took place in N direction at all speeds tested (1.7, 2.8, and 3.9 m/s), about two orders of magnitude of AP and P directions. On the other hand, the lowest wear rate is exhibited when sliding took place in AP direction at higher speed level (2.8 and 3.9 m/s). At lower speed, (1.1, 1.7, and 2.2 m/s) P-orientation gave lower wear rate. The normal orientation shows 25-55% higher friction coefficients than those obtained for other orientations, i.e. P and AP. Although the sliding took place against smooth stainless steel counterface, the SEM microphotographs showed various mechanisms of abrasive wear nature, i.e. fiber fracture, fragmentation, and peeling off, and microcrack initiation in the matrix and debris formation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

An increase in the prestretch ratio within the range of this critical value increases both the tensile stiffness and the tensile strength. If the prestretch ratio goes beyond this critical value and continues to increase, both tensile stiffness and tensile strength display a tendency of slight decrease because of the break of more glass fibers.

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate fracture strength and nanoleakage of endodontically treated weakened teeth after being restored with relined glass fiber-reinforced dowels and two types of cores.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty sound human decoronated and endodontically treated teeth were embedded in epoxy resin blocks, then divided into three groups (n = 20) according to the method of root reconstruction. Group 1 (control): nonweakened roots were restored with glass fiber-reinforced dowels (UNIC); group 2: weakened roots restored with glass fiber-reinforced dowels relined with composite resin; group 3: weakened roots restored with glass fiber-reinforced dowels and a thick layer of luting cement. Dowels were cemented using Corposit, a dual-cured adhesive resin cement, then each group was assigned into two subgroups (n = 10) according to the type of core used; subgroup a: custom-made core using the same luting cement, subgroup b: prefabricated glass fiber-reinforced core (UNIC). Half the specimens of each subgroup were individually mounted at 45° angles and statically compressed until fracture at a 0.5 mm/min crosshead speed with a 5 kN load cell. The type of failure was assessed using a magnification lens. The other half of the specimens were removed from the block, placed in silver nitrate solution for 24 hours followed by photo developer for 8 hours, then examined using environmental scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive analytical X-ray for nanoleakage evaluation. Data were statistically analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: The nonweakened group recorded the highest fracture strength values. The composite relined group showed significantly higher fracture strength values than the cement group. The prefabricated core yielded higher fracture strength values than the custom-made core. All groups showed a degree of nanoleakage, with higher scores recorded for the composite group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The fracture resistance of wide root canals can be improved by using glass fiber-reinforced dowels relined with composite resin as an alternative to increasing the thickness of luting cement; however, the percentage nanoleakage would increase. On the other hand, the recently introduced prefabricated glass fiber-reinforced core can be considered a promising technique, but further investigations are necessary.",

A fracture-mechanics model has been developed and applied to fatigue damage propagation in hybrid metal-composite laminates. A 3-D finite element simulation was used to obtain stress-intensity factors using the virtual crack closure technique. Literature values for the dependence of the metal fatigue crack growth behavior and delamination behavior on the local stress-intensity factor were utilized. The model was effective in predicting the dependence of fatigue damage growth on stress-level, specimen stacking sequence, specimen size and temperature.

          "abstract": "In recent years, the interest of scientists and engineers has turned over on utilizing all plant fibers as effectively and economically as possible to produce good quality fiber-reinforced polymer composites for structural, building, and other needs. It is because of the high availability of the natural resources in this green world. This has led to the development of alternative materials instead of conventional or man-made materials. Among the various natural fibers, roselle fibers were used traditionally in age-old applications in the form of the high-strength ropes and floor mats etc. It is of particular interest because its composites have high tensile strength as in jute, kenafandhemp, besides having moderate impact strength properties compared with other natural fibers. This paper reviews the research published in the field of natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites, with special reference to the effect of moisture absorption and alkali treatment on the mechanical properties. However, the reviews were extended to the machinability and the application of the soft computing technique for prediction and optimization of mechanical properties and fabrication parameters of natural fiber-reinforced composites for the development of roselle fiber polyester composite. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",

Further aim was to evaluate the effect of FC resin on the failure mode of the restoration.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The experimental composite resin (FC) was prepared by mixing 22.5 wt% of short E-glass fibers (3 mm in length) and 22.5 wt% of semi-interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) resin with 55 wt% of silane treated silica fillers. Thirty extracted sound upper central incisors were used. Twenty teeth were prepared by cutting the clinical crown 2 mm above the cemento-enamel junction horizontally. Restorations were made by two techniques (n=10). Group A (control group) contained samples of sound incisor teeth. Group B had teeth restored using glass fiber post (everStick, Stick- Teck) and PFC (Filtek Z250, 3M-ESPE) to build up core and complete crown. In Group C, the teeth were restored with FC as post-core and complete crown of PFC. The root canals were prepared and posts were cemented with a dual cure resin cement. The restorations were polymerized with a hand-light curing unit. All restored teeth were stored in water at room temperature for 24 h before they were statically loaded with speed of 1.0 mm/min until fracture. Data were analyzed using ANOVA (p=0.05). Failure modes were visually examined.\n\nRESULTS: ANOVA revealed that restored incisors (Group B and C) had a statistically significantly lower load-bearing capacity (p&lt;0.05) than the control group. Restorations made from FC post-core and PFC coverage (Group C) gave force value of 363 N (112 SD), which was higher than the value of Group B (211 N, 50 SD).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the teeth restored with experimental fiber composite post-core demonstrated higher load bearing capacity than those with fiber post and PFC core.",

Methods.: Test specimens (n=5) (10.0??10.0??1.5 mm) were prepared from different brands of photopolymerizable resin-preimpregnated FRC; unidirectional continuous FRC, experimental random-oriented FRC, and bidirectional continuous FRC. As control materials, particulate filler composite resin and unfilled dimethacrylate monomer resin were used. Two uniaxial strain gages (gage length 2 mm) were used to measure shrinkage strains in two directions: longitudinally and transversally to the fiber direction. The uncured composite or resin was placed on top of the strain gages, covered with a separating sheet and a glass plate, and irradiated for 40 s with a light-curing unit. The shrinkage strain was monitored for 300 s. ANOVA and Tukey&#039;s posthoc test were used at a significance level of 0.05. Results.: ANOVA revealed that orientation of fiber and brand of material had a significant effect (P&lt;0.05) on shrinkage strain. The unidirectional FRC revealed no shrinkage longitudinally to the fiber direction, whereas the shrinkage occurred transversally to the fiber direction. Particulate filler composite resin and unfilled resin revealed equal shrinkage strain in both of the measured directions. Significance.: Anisotropic nature of FRC exists with regard to polymerization shrinkage strain. The variation of polymerization shrinkage strains of FRC compared to those of particulate filler composites and unfilled resin might be important for future clinical applications. ?? 2005 Academy of Dental Materials.",

The model composites are of Nicalon fibers embedded in an epoxy resin and have a controlled inter-fiber separation. An important qualitative result is that the interfacial failure in each fiber in an array is correlated with that of its neighbors, even when the individual fiber breaks are not at the same location. The fiber bundle as a whole thus has well defined regions of interfacial failure. Quantitatively, fibers in an array have a larger mean fragment length than a single fiber, and the fragment length increases with smaller inter-fiber separation or more embedded fibers. Shear-lag theory predicts the opposite effect. The results suggest that the presence of neighboring fibers prevent failure at some flaws. The flaw density function changes as a result of fiber/fiber interactions and this affects the fiber fragmentation process. Multi-fiber fragmentation tests show that the embedded single fiber test is insufficient to model fiber behavior within real composites. ?? 1995.",

Soil degradation test of both types of composites indi-cated that jute/PP composites significantly lost much of its mechanical properties but E-glass/PP composites retained major portion of its original integrity. Interfaces of the degraded composites were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and supported the biodegradation properties of jute/PP composites.",

          "abstract": "Objectives To determine the physical properties and curing depth of a new short fiber composite intended for posterior large restorations (everX Posterior) in comparison to different commercial posterior composites (Alert, TetricEvoCeram Bulk Fill, Voco X-tra base, SDR, Venus Bulk Fill, SonicFill, Filtek Bulk Fill, Filtek Superme, and Filtek Z250). In addition, length of fiber fillers of composite XENIUS base compared to the previously introduced composite Alert has been measured. Materials and methods The following properties were examined according to ISO standard 4049: flexural strength, flexural modulus, fracture toughness, polymerization shrinkage and depth of cure. The mean and standard deviation were determined and all results were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance ANOVA (a = 0.05). Results XENIUS base composite exhibited the highest fracture toughness (4.6 MPa m 1/2) and flexural strength (124.3 MPa) values and the lower shrinkage strain (0.17%) among the materials tested. Alert composite revealed the highest flexural modulus value (9.9 GPa), which was not significantly different from XENIUS base composite (9.5 GPa). Depth of cure of XENIUS base (4.6 mm) was similar than those of bulk fill composites and higher than other hybrid composites. The length of fiber fillers in XENIUS base was longer (1.3-2 mm) than in Alert (20-60 ??m). Conclusions The new short fiber composite differed significantly in its physical properties compared to other materials tested. This suggests that the latter could be used in high-stress bearing areas. ?? 2013 Academy of Dental Materials.",

Within this scope, graphite flakes and carbon-black powders were dispersed in polystyrene gel and deposited on glass-fiber woven fabrics with different weight ratios. Subsequently, the films were dried at 60 degrees C for 30 min in the air. Structural and surface properties of the produced films were characterized with XRD and SEM, respectively.

In this paper, the in situ strengths of E-glass fibers with five different kinds of surface treatments in epoxy matrix have been estimated by fragmentation tests on single-fiber composites (SFC). The number of fiber breaks as a function of applied stress is simulated according to the Curtin theory for SFC with various fiber strengths and interfacial properties. The Weibull scale parameter, ??(o), and shape parameter, m, at short gauge lengths are determined for each type of fiber through best-fit of the calculated and measured numbers of fiber breaks versus applied fiber stress. Lower values of ??(o) and higher values of m are obtained when compared with those obtained from single-fiber tension (SFT) tests for all kinds of fibers. However, the effects of surface treatments and gauge length on the fiber strength showed similar trends for both methods. It is found that the relatively low values of interfacial shear strengths calculated from SFC data are considered to be reasonable than those from SFT tests. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model combines mean-field homogenization theory with a continuum damage model, leading to a semi-analytical estimate of the composite incremental response that is convenient for the large scale simulation of composite structures. Each representative volume element (RVE) of the composite is decomposed into a set of pseudo-grains (PGs), which are two-phase composites with aligned fibers of the same aspect ratio. The PGs are homogenized individually according to a nonlinear Mori-Tanaka scheme. Then, a self-consistent scheme is applied to the aggregate of homogenized PGs. An anisotropic damage model is used at the PG level which enables accommodating arbitrary multiaxial and non-monotonic loading histories. Damage evolution inside PGs progressively affects the overall stiffness and strength of the RVE up to total failure. An evaluation of the proposed model against experimental data is conducted for short glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6,6 (PA6,6). It is shown that the model yields satisfactory predictions of the response under uniaxial tension on samples with different fiber contents and under various loading directions relative to the main injection flow direction.",

It incorporates both piezocomposite technology and interdigital design techniques to generate the fundamental symmetrical Lamb wave mode in both metallic and carbon-fiber composite plates. Linear systems and finite element modeling techniques have been used to evaluate the operation of the transducer structure, and this is supplemented by experimental verification of the simulated data. An optical fiber, either bonded to the surface or embedded across the length of the composite plate samples, is used to detect the propagating ultrasonic Lamb waves. Single mode silica fiber has been used in conjunction with a portable 633 nm Mach-Zehnder interferometer for signal demodulation and subsequent data acquisition. This hybrid system is shown to generate and detect the fundamental symmetrical Lamb wave (s(0)) in both carbon-fiber and glass-fiber reinforced composite plates.

Glass fiber reinforced composites have excellent specific properties and are widely used because of reduced mass. However the manufacturing of glass fibers and end of life disposal are the major problem to the environment. To overcome these problems, natural fibers are used to manufacture composites. Flax is the one of the naturally available fiber having good mechanical properties than other natural fibers. It needs to be pointed out that most of research effort about the flax fiber reinforced composites focuses on the manufacturing techniques and primary mechanical properties and not on the secondary properties like sound absorption and vibration damping. In this paper, sound absorption and vibration damping properties of flax fiber reinforced composites were characterized and compared with the glass fiber reinforced composites. It was experimentally observed that the sound absorption coefficient of flax fiber reinforced composites has 21.42% &amp; 25% higher than that of glass fiber reinforced composites at higher frequency level (2000 Hz) and lower frequency level (100 Hz). From the vibration study it was observed that the flax fiber reinforced composites have 51.03% higher vibration damping than the glass fiber reinforced composites. The specific flexural strength and specific flexural modulus for flax fiber reinforced composites also good. These results suggest that the flax fiber reinforced composites could be a viable candidate for applications which need good sound and vibration properties.",

          "abstract": "Optical fiber sensors have seen an increased acceptance as well as a widespread use for structural sensing and monitoring in civil engineering, aerospace, marine, oil &amp; gas, composites and smart structure applications. Optical fiber sensor operation and instrumentation have become well understood and developed. Fiber sensors are attractive sensing devices for non-destructive testing (NDT) applications given their small size, lightweight and dielectric glass construction that renders them immune to electrical noise and EM interference-unlike most conventional electronic sensing systems. To date, fiber sensors have been embedded inside composite materials to determine curing, internal stresses and deformations as well as to detect the onset of cracks and damage. Surface mounted devices allow for the on-line monitoring in real time of deformations and strains in a variety of test specimens. Furthermore, some specific fiber sensor types allow for multi-point sensing at different locations using a single fiber, or even continuous, distributed sensing of temperature and strain based on Raman and Brillouin scattering systems. This paper reviews the operating principles, sensor types, benefits and applications of optical fiber sensors for non-destructive testing of materials and structures in different fields such as composites, aerospace, civil engineering, oil &amp; gas and others. © RILEM 2013.",

The glass-fiber reinforced composite material (everSTICK, StickTech Ltd, Turku, Finland) offers a restorative solution that is conservative and esthetic when compared to other restorations. Advantages include reduction of cost compared to conventional bridges, saving of time, elimination of second visit, ease of application, absence of metal allergy, ease of cleaning, and naturalness of feel. Its limitations include occlusal factors, and the presence of unsuitable abutment teeth. Another traditional contraindication is the presence of diastemas, which may limit the potential esthetic gains.

A constitutive model based on micromechanical considerations is presented. The nucleation and growth of voids induced by progressive fiber debonding is combined with the constitutive relationship. Failure resulting of excessive damage accumulation is captured by a critical void volume criterion and a vanishing element technique. Experimentally, damage accumulation in random glass fiber-polyester composites was monitored by a videoextensometry technique able to control the local strain rate. Good agreement of model predictions with experimental data is pointed out. The model was implemented into a finite element program and numerical applications on composite structures (a tensile specimen and a plate containing a central hole) are presented to illustrate the capability of the approach. Digital image correlation method was also used to measure the full-field strain in a notched specimen under tensile loading. The simulated results compared favourably with those obtained from experiments. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Compared to oxide-based glasses, vitreous materials involving chalcogens form a rather new family of glasses which have received attention, mainly because of their transmission in the mid-infrared. Indeed as low phonon compounds, these heavy-anion glasses allow the fabrication of molded optics for infrared cameras as well as infrared fibers operating in a large spectral range. These waveguides, when correctly tapered, allows the development of a new generation of sensitive evanescent-wave optical sensors which have been used for biomedical applications. Here we will focus on the spectral analysis of biomolecules present in human lung cells by measuring their infrared signatures. Because they contain heavy polarizable anions as well as lone-pair electrons, these glasses exhibit very large non-linear properties compared to silica and are candidates for fast optical switching and signal regeneration in telecom. Due to the technological interest in chalcogenide glasses, more information is needed on their structural organization and 77Se NMR spectroscopy appears to be a useful tool for checking the local environment of the Se atoms. ?",

In this investigation, rotating bending fatigue tests have been conducted on two types of unidirectional glass-fiber reinforced polymeric composites, having vinylester and Epoxy as matrix materials. It has been observed that the probabilistic distribution of fatigue-life of these glass-fiber reinforced composites, at a particular stress level, can be modeled by two-parameter Weibull distribution, with statistical co-relation coefficient values exceeding 0.90. Various methods have been used to obtain the parameters of Weibull distribution. Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test has also been used to reinforce the above findings.

Fiber reinforcements are effective in reducing wear in adhesive situations in addition to increasing the strength and stiffness. The adhesive conditions are generally encountered in automotive and aerospace applications. In such applications, the types of reinforcement material used are important from the point of improved performance under different tribo situations. In this particular investigation, carbon-epoxy (C-E) composite is compared with that of glass-epoxy (G-E) composites for tribological properties using a pin-on-disc set up. The tests are conducted by subjecting C-E samples sliding against a hard steel disc (62 HRC) under different sliding and loading conditions. This article highlights the friction and wear behavior of these composites run for a constant sliding distance, where in the C-E composites show lower friction and lower slide wear loss compared to G-E composites irrespective of the load or speed employed. Some of the wear data are supported by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images.",

While the strengths of the bamboo fiber reinforced composites reduce with sorption time and temperature, the environmental degradation process can be delayed by adding a small amount of glass fiber. Moisture sorption and strength reduction are further suppressed by using maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent in both types of composite system.

In this study, a fluorescent glass filler containing rare earth oxides - which are well-known fluorescent materials - was prepared and used in composite resin to enhance visual inspection capability with small change in color. For example, when irradiated with near ultraviolet light, an Eu2O3-containing filler fluoresced clearly and visibly. The fluorescence intensity of the prepared composite resin increased with increase of Eu2O3 content in the glass filler and with filler/resin ratio in the resin. Despite the clear fluorescence, the effect of Eu2O3 on the color change of composite resin was quite small - even when up to 10 wt% Eu2O3 was added to the glass filler. Tb4O7- and Dy2O3-added fillers also showed clear fluorescence, just like Eu2O3-added filler. Therefore, fluorescent glass fillers for composite resins, resulting in small color change in the latter, were successfully prepared in this study.",

The effect of changing the fiber orientations of the less stiff, off-axis glass fiber plies (referred to as stability plies in this paper) was studied via nonlinear finite element buckling simulations. The orientation of the stability plies was found to influence the onset of the Brazier effect, which further influenced blade stability and buckling failure location. Although both blade weight and laminate thickness remained constant, an increase in critical buckling load of 8% was achieved with a negligible change in bending stiffness. The more stable blade allowed for removal of material leading to a decrease in maximum laminate thickness and a drop in blade mass of 3.3%. Modifications to the ply stacking sequence and carbon fiber usage were also considered and were found to affect the buckling load but not necessarily the optimum fiber orientation of the stability plies.

The addition of glass fibers into ceramic concrete had little influence on the compressive strength and modulus of elasticity but resulted in significant increases in flexural strength and direct shear strength, regardless of the matrix type or fiber length. The results also showed that the compression, the flexure and the shear toughness all increased with an increase in the fiber content, while the workability decreased with an increase in fiber content.

          "abstract": "The utilization of composite materials instead of traditional materials in structural high-speed applications has induced the need for a proper knowledge of dynamic behavior as well as static behavior of them. The material and structural response vary significantly under dynamic loading as compared to static loading conditions. In order to investigate the dynamic responses of composite materials under dynamic loading at various strain rates, special testing machines are needed. Most of the researches in this field are focused on applying real loading and gripping boundary conditions on the testing specimens. The present study is carried out in order to characterize the compressive properties of unidirectional glass-fiber reinforced polymeric composites using a servo-hydraulic testing apparatus at varying strain rates, ranging from 0.001 to 100 s-1. For performing practical tests, a jig and a fixture are designed and manufactured, which could insure the alignment of axial loads on the specimens. During of tests, the performance of the test jig is evaluated. It is found that the designed jig and the fixture perform very well during the test process. The results of the dynamic tests are compared with the results of the static tests carried out on specimens with identical geometry. Based on the experimental results obtained from the tests, empirical functions for the mechanical properties are proposed in terms of strain rates. The results of the study indicate that strain rate has a significant effect on the material response. It is found that the compressive strength and modulus both increased with increasing the strain rate. Also, the results show that the compressive strain to failure is generally insensitive to strain rate. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of exposed E-glass fibers and bioactive glass (BAG) particles on the surface wettability behavior of composite implants. Two different groups were investigated: (a) fiber reinforced composites (FRCs) with different fiber orientations and (b) polymer composites with different wt. % of BAG particles. Photopolymerized and heat postpolymerized composite substrates were made for both groups. The surface wettability, topography, and roughness were analyzed. Equilibrium contact angles were measured using the sessile drop method. Three liquids were used as a probe for surface free energy (SFE) calculations. SFE values were calculated from contact angles obtained on smooth surfaces. The surface with transverse distribution of fibers showed higher (P &lt; 0.001) polar (γ(P)) and total SFE (γ(TOT)) components (16.9 and 51.04mJ/m(2), resp.) than the surface with in-plane distribution of fibers (13.77 and 48.27mJ/m(2), resp.). The increase in BAG particle wt. % increased the polar (γ(P)) value, while the dispersive (γ(D)) value decreased. Postpolymerization by heat treatment improved the SFE components on all the surfaces investigated (P &lt; 0.001). Composites containing E-glass fibers and BAG particles are hydrophilic materials that show good wettability characteristics.",

In this study, pulp fibers [including bleached Kraft pulp (BKP) and thermomechanical pulp (TMP)], hemp, flax, and wood flour were used for reinforcing in polypropylene (PP) composite. The results show that pulp fibers, in particular, TMP-reinforced PP has the highest tensile strength, possibly because pulp fibers were subjected to less severe shortening during compounding, compared to hemp and flax fiber bundles. Maleic-anhydride grafted PP (MAPP) with high maleic anhy- dride groups and high molecular weight was more effective in improving strength properties of PP composite as a compatiblizer. Coupled with 10% glass fiber, 40% TMP reinforced PP had a tensile strength of 70MPa and a specific tensile strength comparable to glass fiber reinforced PP. Thermomechanical pulp was more effective in reinforcing than BKP.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron micro- scope (SEM) were used to aid in the analysis. Polypropylene with high impact strength was also used in compounding to improve the low-impact strength prevalent in natural fiber-reinforced PP from injection molding.",

Three different types of fiber reinforced nanocomposites are fabricated using 1wt% nanoclay, 3wt% nanoclay and 5wt% nanoclay with 30% wt fiber, epoxy resin and hardener. The epoxy resin and hardener are mixed in 10:4 weight ratios. Three different test, tensile test, hardness test and flexural test were measured through using mechanical test instruments. The mechanical test shows that the tensile and flexural strength for 3wt% nanoclay composite is more compared to 1wt% and 5wt% nanoclay composite. To improve the flexural and tensile properties are 57% and 8% respectively by adding 3wt% of nanoclay.

In this study, we experimentally measured the fiber orientations in two injection-molded specimens produced from 30 wt% short-glass-fiber-reinforced polyamide 6 using plate-shaped cavities with and without a weld-line. The fiber orientation distributions were observed directly using a high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) X-ray computed tomography (CT) system XVA-160α. A simple method based on a series of X-ray CT images was developed to measure the orientation angles of the individual fibers. Further, precise 3D calculations of the fiber orientations related to the second-order orientation tensor components were performed to obtain a consistent description of the observed behavior. Consequently, this study explored a potential application of X-ray CT imaging, a novel and powerful technique for observing and measuring fiber orientation. Further, the software CIMP-PACK3DM was employed to analyze the resin flow in the mold cavity using the finite element method (FEM). The filling patterns of the injection-molded plates with and without a weld-line as determined using FEM were in good quantitative agreement with the X-ray CT imaging analysis results. It was found that the fiber 3D orientation distributions of the injection-molded plates with and without a weld-line could be obtained with precision by combining the high-resolution 3D X-ray CT system XVA-160α with the resin flow analysis software CIMP-PACK3DM using FEM.",

These three models represent various orders (or levels) of detail in the fiber composite structure and, hence, capture various physical aspects of the composite. These models can be used to efficiently calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as the shielding effectiveness, of these fiber composites. We compare results of the reflection coefficient and shielding effectiveness obtained from these effective-property models to results obtained from a full numerical solution based on the finite-element (FE) method of the actual periodic fiber composite. We show that, as expected, as more of the geometric detail of the fiber composite is captured with the different models, the upper frequency limit of validity increases.",

It was observed that the crystallization temperature peak (T-p) of LLDPE composite containing 5.0 wt % GF (LLDPE/GF5) was higher than that of the pure LLDPE at various cooling rates. The half-time of crystallization (t(1/2)) of LLDPE/GF5 composite was shortened under the effect of GF. The nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of LLDPE and LLDPE/GF5 composite were analyzed through the Avrami, Ozawa, and Mo equations. The results indicated that the data of the nonisothermal crystallization for LLDPE and LLDPE/GF5 composite calculated based on the Ozawa equation did not have the good linear relationship, but the nonisothermal crystallization behaviors of LLDPE and LLDPE/GF5 composite could be successfully described by the modified Avrami and Mo methods. The crystallization rate Z(c) of the modified Avrami parameter of LLDPE/GF5 composite was higher than that of pure LLDPE at the same cooling rate. The Mo parameter F(T) of LLDPE/GF5 composite was lower than that of LLDPE at the same degree of crystallinity. Through the Kissinger equation, the activation energies E-d of LLDPE and LLDPE/GF5 composite were evaluated, and their values were 312.3 and 251.2 kJ/mol, respectively.

Two different strategies have been utilized, which are based on the use of cationic chitosan and anionic alginate biopolymers. The mechanism of cathodic deposition of chitosan is based on the pH increase at the cathode surface, whereas the pH decrease at the anode surface enabled the deposition of alginate coatings. The use of chitosan and alginate enabled the electrosteric stabilization and deposition of bioactive glass and HA particles. Composite coatings were obtained on various conductive substrates and studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The composition of the coatings can be varied by variation of bioactive glass and HA concentrations in the suspensions. The proposed method offers the advantages of room temperature fabrication of bioactive composite coatings that are suitable for biomedical applications. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

A comparison of the properties of this binder with Ordinary Portland Cement pastes, which constitutes one of the most common and economic ceramic matrices is also provided. The iron-based binder system exhibits fracture parameters (fracture toughness, KICS and critical crack tip opening displacement, CTODC, determined using two parameter fracture model, TPFM) that are significantly higher when compared to those of the OPC systems in both the unreinforced and glass fiber reinforced states. The beneficial influence of the unreacted metallic iron particles of large aspect ratio, on the fracture parameters of iron-based binders are elucidated. The strain energy release rates show trends that are in line with the fracture parameters from TPFM. The elastic and inelastic components of strain energy release rate are separated in an effort to capture the fundamental toughening mechanisms in these systems. The fracture parameters determined using a non-contact, digital image correlation technique are found to relate well to those obtained from TPFM.",

The influence of nano-particles on the spun hollow fiber membrane characteristics was investigated. The addition of hydrophobic nano-particles could optimize the sandwich-like morphology, narrow the pore size distribution, improve the membrane porosity and increase the membrane surface roughness and contact angle to some extent. The nano-particles also enhanced the crystallinity degree and thermal stability of the hollow fiber. In addition, the composite membranes presented stronger mechanical properties compared to the fiber without particles. During the desalination process of 3.5wt% sodium chloride solution, the maximum transmembrane permeate flux about 46.3kg/m 2h with a lower thermal loss was obtained from the composite fiber when the hot feed inlet temperature and the cold distillate inlet temperature were at 80.5??C and 20.0??C, respectively. Furthermore, the composite membrane exhibited satisfying performance stability compared with the pure PVDF membrane in the 30 days continuous desalination experiments, indicating that the as-spun composite fiber may be of great potential to be utilized in MD process for desalination. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Study design: Eighty human maxillary central incisors were divided into 8 groups (n = 10), decoronated, and roots filled and restored with one of the following post systems: groups 1 to 4: translucent quartz FRC posts; groups 5 and 6: opaque glass FRC post; and groups 7 and 8: individually formed electrical glass fiber post. Cementation was performed with 2 types of dual-polymerizing resin luting agents: Variolink II (groups 1, 3, 5, and 7) and a new self-adhesive resin cement, RelyX Unicem (groups 2, 4, 6, and 8). Slices with a thickness of 1.00 ?? 0.05 mm were prepared from the coronal third of each root by using a low-speed saw.

Fracture modes were evaluated at original magnification ??40. Results: Micro push-out bond strengths were significantly affected by the type of luting agent and the type of post (P &lt; .05, 2-way ANOVA). A significant difference was found among the groups (1-way ANOVA, P &lt; .05). Fiber-reinforced composite posts luted with Variolink II showed higher bond strengths, and the groups ordered as 5, 1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 4, and 8, with the values (MPa, mean ??

Specimens were loaded in a universal testing machine until fracture. The mean flexural strengths (MPa) was compared by one way ANOVA test, followed by Scheffe analysis, using a significance level of 0.05. Flexural strength between fiber-reinforced resin groups were compared by independent samples t-test.\n\nRESULTS: For control groups, the flexural strength for PMMA (215.53 MPa) was significantly lower than for bis-acryl composite resin (240.09 MPa). Glass fiber reinforcement produced significantly higher flexural strength for both PMMA (267.01 MPa) and bis-acryl composite resin (305.65 MPa), but the polyethylene fibers showed no significant difference (PMMA resin-218.55 MPa and bis-acryl composite resin-241.66 MPa). Among the reinforced groups, silane impregnated glass fibers showed highest flexural strength for bis-acryl composite resin (305.65 MPa).\n\nCONCLUSION: Of two fiber reinforcement methods evaluated, glass fiber reinforcement for the PMMA resin and bis-acryl composite resin materials produced highest flexural strength.\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: On the basis of this in-vitro study, the use of glass and polyethylene fibers may be an effective way to reinforce provisional restorative resins. When esthetics and space are of concern, glass fiber seems to be the most appropriate method for reinforcing provisional restorative resins.",

          "abstract": "The interest in Lignocellulosic fiber composites has been growing in recent years because of their high specific properties. In this work, a new technique was used to prepare specimen to observe the transcrystalline zones in kenaf fiber-polypropylene composites. A maleated polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agent was used to improve the stress-transfer efficiency in the composites. Transcrystallinity was observed for both the uncoupled and coupled composites, although the rate of growth was higher for the coupled composites. Dynamic mechanical spectroscopy was used to observe the relaxations of the composites. The peak temperature of the B-relaxation, associated with the glass-rubber transition of the amorphous molecules, of the coupled composites was higher than that of the uncoupled composites. Restricted molecular mobility due to covalent interactions between the MAPP and the lignocellulosic surface may account for the shift to higher temperatures. It appears that during compounding the extractives sheared from the fiber surface is an important factor in determining the B-relaxation of these composites. The intensities of the ct-transition, related to molecular mobility associated with the presence of crystals, is proportional to the fiber volume fraction. Thus it is possible that the molecules responsible for the cr-transition are predominantly in the transcrystalline zone. These &#039;rigid&#039; amorphous molecules in the transcrystalline zone do play a role in composite behavior and need to be considered when tailoring interphases.",

The first severe failure induced by the low-velocity drop-weight impact occurred as delamination between the aluminum and fiber-epoxy layers at the non-impact side. It was followed by a visible shear crack in the outer aluminum layer on the non-impact face. Through-thickness shear cracks in the aluminum sheets and severe damage in the fiber laminated layers (including delamination between adjacent fiber-epoxy laminae with different fiber orientations) developed under higher energy impacts. The impact properties of fiber-metal laminates varied with different constituent materials and fiber orientations. Since it was punched through easily, the aramid-fiber reinforced fiber-metal laminates (ARALL) offered poorer impact resistance than the glass-fiber reinforced fiber-metal laminates (GLARE). Tougher and more ductile aluminum alloys improved the impact resistance. GLARE made of cross-ply prepregs provided better impact resistance than GLARE with unidirectional plies.",

          "abstract": "The intention of the work presented in this paper was to find a way to measure the through-thickness strain (TTS) in composite laminates. The reason for this was because there did not seem to be any effective technique for the measurement of the TTS, particularly for locations away from the free edge. In the present work, Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were added into epoxy resin to make the resin electrically conductive. The modified resin was then incorporated with long glass fibers to make glass/epoxy laminates. The laminate was subjected to a uniaxial load, while the electrical resistances across the thickness of the laminate were measured. Two different types of uniaxial loads were applied. One was along the length of the sample and the other across the thickness of the sample. For the case where lengthwise load was applied, classical lamination theory (CLT) was used to calculate the average TTS (ATTS), and to find stacking sequences that can provide the largest ATTS for a certain load. Strain gage was mounted on the edge of the laminate in order to provide another means to measure the ATTS. It was found that the electrical resistance across the laminate thickness is sensitive to the axial load along the length of the sample. The magnitude of the change in electrical resistance across the laminate thickness is proportional to the strain measured by strain gage. However, while the strain measured by strain gage shows negative strain, there was an increase in the through-thickness electrical resistance (TTER). For the case of thicknesswise load, the strain is negative and the TTER shows decrease. For the thicknesswise load, the change in TTER can be related to the ATTS. For the lengthwise load, even though the magnitude of the change in TTER is proportional to the ATTS, the change in TTER may not be completely due to the ATTS. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "The invention is an effort to utilize the advantages offered by renewable resources for the development of composite materials based on polymer and particles of natural fibers for Conservation of natural resources. In this research, natural fibers like Sisal (Agave sisalana), Banana (Musa sepientum) and Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa), Sisal and banana (hybrid), Roselle and banana (hybrid) and Roselle and sisal (hybrid) are fabricated with bio epoxy resin using molding method. The applications of these materials require a sustainable approach to creating green products. Green materials are very important to form environment friendly from renewable resources and decrease the use of petroleum based chemicals. Nowadays natural fibers form an interesting alternative for the most widely applied fibre in the composite technology, glass. The use of fibers like sisal, Roselle and banana in this industry so far is small since availability of a durable semifinished product with constant quality is often a problem. Recent research and development have shown that these aspects can be improved considerably. Knowing that natural fibers are cheap and have a better stiffness per weight than glass, which results in lighter components, the grown interest in natural fibers is clear. Secondly, the environmental impact is smaller since the natural fibre can be thermally recycled and fibers come from a renewable resource. Their moderate mechanical properties restrain the fibers from using them in high-tech applications, but for many reasons they can compete with glass fibers. In this paper the optimum mixing of fiber and resin is achieved by using Taguchi method. In this work, tensile and hardness of Sisal and banana (hybrid), Roselle and banana (hybrid and Roselle and sisal (hybrid) composite at dry and wet conditions were studied. Hardness test were conducted using Brinell hardness testing machine. In this work micro structure of the specimens are scanned by the Scanning Electron Microscope. The disclosure includes the process to make the composite and also the variety of products in automobile accessories. © 2013 Science Publication.",

          "abstract": "Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are often electrically insulating materials. Due to the presence of diffusion barrier(s) in between such MIP coating and electrode surface and the absence of a direct path for the conduction of electrons from the binding sites to the electrode, the development of electrochemical sensor is significantly restricted. The direct use of MIPs those possess intrinsic electron-transport properties, is highly limited. These problems are resolved by the design of an original, substrate-selective MIP-fiber sensor that combines conventional insulating MIP and conducting carbon powder in consolidated phase. A layer of conducting carbon particles, arranged orderly as &#039;carbon strip&#039;, is inducted in the polymer for direct electronic conduction. MIP-carbon composite (monolithic fiber) in this work is prepared via in situ free radical polymerization of a new monomer (2,4,6-trisacrylamido-1,3,5-triazine, TAT) and subsequent cross-linkage with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, in the presence of carbon powder and template (folic acid), at 55??C in a glass capillary. The detection of folic acid with the MIP-fiber sensor was found to be specific and quantitative (detection limit 0.20ngmL-1, RSD=1.3%, S/N=3), in aqueous, blood serum and pharmaceutical samples, without any problem of non-specific false-positive contribution and cross-reactivity. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

Three groups of fiber-reinforced composite crowns were constructed using one polyethylene fiber (belleGlass/Connect) and two glass fiber reinforcement systems (Sculpture/FiberKor, Targis/Vectris). The non-fiber-reinforced crowns based on the facing material alone: Sculpture, Targis or belleGlass. Additionally, crowns were made of the non-reinforced composite Artglass. Each group consisted of eight crowns. All crowns were luted to human molars and exposed to thermal cycling and mechanical loading (6000 x 5 degrees C/55 degrees C; 1.2 x 10(6x)50 N; 1.66 Hz). The fracture resistance was measured using a Zwick universal testing machine. Results: The non-reinforced Artglass crowns demonstrated the highest fracture resistance, significantly higher than the resistance shown with belleGlass, belleGlass/Connect or Targis. Artglass showed an extremely wide distribution of values, however. No statistically significant differences were found between the reinforced and non-reinforced composite crowns of Vectris/Targis, FiberKor/Sculpture or Connect/belleGlass although the reinforced crowns showed a tendency towards higher values. The fracture resistance values scattered markedly more for the reinforced crowns, and their lowest fracture values also reached the level of the lowest non-reinforced crowns. The small distribution of fracture values for the non-reinforced crowns indicates that they will be less susceptible for manufacturing faults and more reliable under clinical conditions. Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that single molar composite crowns (tested in this study) do not benefit from fiber-reinforcement.",

          "abstract": "Environmental awareness and depletion of the petroleum resources are among vital factors that motivate a number of researchers to explore the potential of reusing natural fiber as an alternative composite material in industries such as packaging, automotive and building constructions. Natural fibers are available in abundance, low cost, lightweight polymer composite and most importance its biodegradability features, which often called “ecofriendly” materials. However, their applications are still limited due to several factors like moisture absorption, poor wettability and large scattering in mechanical properties. Among the main challenges on natural fibers reinforced matrices composite is their inclination to entangle and form fibers agglomerates during processing due to fiber-fiber interaction. This tends to prevent better dispersion of the fibers into the matrix, resulting in poor interfacial adhesion between the hydrophobic matrix and the hydrophilic reinforced natural fiber. Therefore, to overcome this challenge, fiber treatment process is one common alternative that can be use to modify the fiber surface topology by chemically, physically or mechanically technique. Nevertheless, this paper attempt to focus on the effect of mercerization treatment on mechanical properties enhancement of natural fiber reinforced composite or so-called bio composite. It specifically discussed on mercerization parameters, and natural fiber reinforced composite mechanical properties enhancement.",

          "abstract": "A review is presented of the possible hazards of fibrous glass. In 1961, a case was reported of a man incurring serious lung problems from fiber glass. His job was to tear the fiber glass insulation out of old hot water heaters, and clouds of fiber glass surrounded him when he was working. He developed &#039;fiber glass pneumoconiosis&#039;, and his doctor had to remove part of 1 lung. But the diagnosis of this case has been challenged. There is some evidence that fibrous glass when reduced to a distribution of sizes approaching that of conventionally milled asbestos is carcinogenic. The available evidence may understate the seriousness of the potential hazard. For example, fiber glass workers in the 1940s and 1950s encountered fibers of relatively large diameter. The newest fiber glass products often contain much thinner fibers which are quite possibly a good deal more dangerous. Therefore the studies of fiber glass workers exposed during the &#039;40s and &#039;50s may be irrelevant to the present situation. It is evident that, in a mere 30 yr, man has contaminated thousands or millions of sq miles of the earth with this potentially cancer causing material. Have we caused an epidemic of cancer among ourselves? In the case of asbestos there is a delay of 20 to 55 yr between the first exposure and the appearance of cancer. Such long delays are not unusual with cancer causing agents. If fiber glass causes cancers after similar delays, we may only now be entering the period in which illnesses begin to appear. Unfortunately, only time will tell. In the meantime, it would appear prudent to consider fiber glass in very nearly the same class as asbestos, potentially highly toxic, and to discourage its use wherever possible by every reasonable means, including a legal ban on its use in all but essential applications.",

In order to explore the effect of fiber orientation angle on the Young&#039;s modulus of composites, from the basic theory of elastic mechanics, a procedure which can be applied to evaluate the elastic stiffness matrix of GFRP composite as an analytical function of fiber orientation angle (from 0 to 90), was developed. At the same time, different finite element models with inclined glass fiber were developed via the ABAQUS Scripting Interface. Results indicate that Young&#039;s modulus of the composites strongly depends on the fiber orientation angles. A U-shaped dependency of the Young&#039;s modulus of composites on the inclined angle of fiber is found, which agree well with the experimental results. The shear modulus is found to have significant effect on the composites&#039; Young&#039;s modulus, too. The effect of volume content of glass fiber on the Young&#039;s modulus of composites was investigated. Results indicate the relation between them is nearly linear.

Different full-scale specimen shapes were examined: Plate strips as-delivered, plate strips with tabs and plates in tapered form. Experiments were performed up to ten million loading cycles with different frequencies up to 12 Hz. It was observed that the specimen temperature could increase during fatigue test. This increase was dependent on the loading frequency and the loading range. S-N fatigue life curves were determined. Tapered specimens showed a higher fatigue life than as-delivered specimens; and as-delivered specimens showed higher fatigue lives than tabbed specimens. A degradation rate of 3-5% of the single-cycle ultimate tension strength (UTS) per decade of fatigue cycles was observed. This observation is not consistent with a characteristic slope of 10% UTS/decade as shown from many previous studies. A loss of specimen stiffness up to 50% during the fatigue experiments was observed and can only be explained by considerable fiber failures. This finding is consistent with results from previous studies showing that fatigue failure of fiber-reinforced polymer composites is basically fiber dominated. The fatigue behavior of the plates was compared with the fatigue behavior of adhesively bonded double-lap joints made from the same plates. Plates and joints showed converging fatigue life curves and the same fatigue limit at approximately 25% of the single-cycle failure load at ten million cycles. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus is placed on fatigue lives of tubular specimens under tension/torsion biaxial loading at low cycle up to 100,000 cycles. Filament-wound glass-fiber/epoxy tubular specimens with three different lay-up configurations, namely [+/- 35 degrees](n), [+/- 55 degrees](n), and [+/- 70 degrees](n), lay-ups, are subjected to in-phase proportional biaxial cyclic loading conditions. The effects of winding angle and biaxiality ratio on the multiaxial fatigue performance of composites are discussed. Specimens are also tested under two cyclic stress ratio: R = 0 and R = -1. The experimental results reveal that both tensile and compressive loading have an influence on the multiaxial fatigue strength, especially for [+/- 35 degrees](n) specimens. A damage model proposed in the literature is applied to predict multiaxial fatigue life of filament-wound composites and the predictions are compared with the experimental results. It is shown that the model is unsuitable for describing the multiaxial fatigue life under different cyclic stress ratios.",

Surface properties of sized GFs and transverse tensile strength of unidirectional GF reinforced composites were studied using various surface and interface analysis methods and tensile testing, respectively. Two-stage technology achieved sized GFs with lower loss-on-ignition (LOI) and resulted in poor fibre-matrix adhesion strength. However, applying silane coupling agent at the first sizing stage with an increased roller speed achieved sized GFs with lower LOI but composites with mechanical properties quite close to those of composites based on one-stage technology. Moreover, the difference in surface properties of sized GFs is discussed in terms of the wetting ability difference of sizing constituents and the interactions between sizing components. © BME-PT.",

The hybrid composites were fabricated using a hand lay-up method and cured at room temperature under a compressive load of 196 N (20 kg). The OPWF of 2.5 to 10 parts per hundred (pph) by weight was used to evaluate its effect on impact strength of the hybrid composites at a range of temperature from -50 to 50 degrees C. The impact strength, evaluated using V-notch Charpy method, showed reduction with increasing filler content up to 5 pph and then the strength increment in those composites containing more than 5 pph OPWF. More severe damages were found in specimens with higher filter contents resulting higher energy absorption during impact. The composites with a large amount of OPWF particles deflected crack propagation paths or created obstacles at the crack tips and increased toughness of the composites. The impact strength was found to decrease when the samples fractured at subzero temperatures and this happened because of the reduction of the matrix ductility at lower temperatures.",

The development of non-resorbable polyethylene and polysulphone matrices for these materials has improved the mechanical properties. However, the primary concern of whether the bioactivity of the composites is reduced is still unresolved. The more recent development of resorbable carrier systems, dextran and collagen, for bioactive glasses does not introduce such problems, hence making this form of composite suitable for novel soft tissue applications. The development of a simple quality index has enabled some of the materials described within this paper to be ranked by their ability to replace bone, thus enabling possible new research directions to be emphasized.",

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to study the effect of process parameters on machining process. This procedure eliminates the need for repeated experiments, time and conserves the material by the conventional procedure. The drilling parameters and specimen parameters evaluated are speed, feed rate, drill size and specimen thickness. A series of experiments are conducted using TRIAC VMC CNC machining center to relate the cutting parameters and material parameters on the cutting thrust and torque. The measured results were collected and analyzed with the help of the commercial software package MINITAB14. An orthogonal array, signal-to-noise ratio are employed to analyze the influence of these parameters on cutting force and torque during drilling. The method could be useful in predicting thrust and torque parameters as a function of cutting parameters and specimen parameters. The main objective is to find the important factors and combination of factors influence the machining process to achieve low cutting low cutting thrust and torque. From the analysis of the Taguchi method indicates that among the all-significant parameters, speed and drill size are more significant influence on cutting thrust than the specimen thickness and the feed rate. Study of response table indicates that the specimen thickness, and drill size are the significant parameters of torque. From the interaction among process parameters, thickness and drill size together is more dominant factor than any other combination for the torque characteristic. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Metallic custom and prefabricated posts have been used over the years, however, due to unacceptable color, extreme rigidity and corrosion, fiber posts, which are flexible, aesthetically pleasing and have modulus of elasticity comparable with dentin were introduced.\n\nAIM: To compare clinical performance of metallic and glass fiber posts in restoration of ETT.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 40 ETT requiring post retained restorations were included. These teeth were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Twenty teeth were restored using a glass fiber-reinforced post (FRP) and 20 others received stainless steel parapost (PP), each in combination with composite core buildups. Patients were observed at 1 and 6 months after post placement and cementation of porcelain fused to metal (PFM) crown. Marginal gap consideration, post retention, post fracture, root fracture, crown fracture, crown decementation and loss of restoration were part of the data recorded. All teeth were assessed clinically and radiographically. Fisher&#039;s exact test was used for categorical values while log-rank test was used for descriptive statistical analysis.\n\nRESULTS: One tooth in the PP group failed, secondary to decementation of the PFM crown giving a 2.5% overall failure while none in the FRP group failed. The survival rate of FRP was thus 100% while it was 97.5% in the PP group. This however was not statistically significant (log-rank test, P = 0.32).\n\nCONCLUSION: Glass FRPs performed better than the metallic post based on short-term clinical performance.",

          "abstract": "Fiber optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) are based on the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of glass fibers. If two strong pumps and a weak signal are fed into a fiber, an idler is generated. Signal and idler can grow together if pump power is high enough, and phase matching occurs. In recent years, impressive performance has been demonstrated in several respects: 1) Gain in excess of 60 dB has been obtained; 2) fiber OPAs can exhibit a large variety of gain spectra: a gain bandwidth of 400 nm has been demonstrated; tunable narrowband gain regions can also be generated; 3) Noise figure of 3.7 dB, limited by other third-order nonlinear process; 4) Polarization-insensitive operation in both one-pump and two-pump configurations; 5) The presence of the idler can be used for wavelength conversion. Also, the spectrum of the idler is inverted with respect to that of the signal; thus by placing an OPA in the middle of a fiber span one can realize mid-span spectral inversion (MSSI) which counteracts the effect of fiber dispersion and some nonlinear effects. Besides using fiber OPA in continuous-wave regime as in typical systems, pulsed-pump has also been demonstrated to achieve larger bandwidth and higher peak gain by combining with optical filtering technique. Furthermore, by modulating the pump it is possible to modulate signal and/or idler at the output. This can be used to implement a variety of signal processing functions, including: fast signal switching; demultiplexing of time-division-multiplexed signals; retiming and reshaping of waveforms; optical sampling. A number of challenges must be overcome in order for fiber OPAs to be useful in communication applications. In multi-wavelength systems, these are: four-wave mixing, cross-phase modulation; and cross-gain modulation between signals. Furthermore, the pump-to-signal relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer and frequency/phase modulation (FM/PM) to signal intensity conversion are also potential challenges for - ractical fiber OPAs",

Regarding fiber length, the tensile properties had a maximum at a fiber length of about 5 mm. The flexural properties of the PHBV/abaca composite were improved by the surface treatment of abaca with butyric anhydride and pyridine for 5 h because of the increase of interfacial adhesiveness between the matrix polyester and the surface-esterified fiber, as is obvious from the SEM micrographs. The flexural and tensile properties of PHBV/treated abaca composite were comparable to those of PHBV/GF composite, except for tensile modulus, compared with the same weight fraction of fiber.

Here, low velocity impact tests are undertaken using an instrumented impact tower and high velocity impact tests are conducted using a nitrogen gas gun. Low velocity impact testing has shown that the specific perforation energy of the CF/PEEK-based FMLs is similar to that offered by the CF/PEEK composite. In contrast, the specific perforation energy of the GF/PEI FML system is lower than that of the plain PEI composite. The experimental evidence suggests that the inclusion of strong titanium alloy plies does not improve the perforation resistance of these FMLs. High velocity impact tests resulted in failure processes similar to those observed under low velocity loading conditions, with the specific perforation energy of the GF/PEI-based FMLs being higher than those exhibited by the plain GF/PEI composite. An extensive and detailed optical microscope study has shown that interfacial and interlaminar delaminations are the principal energy-absorbing mechanisms during low and high velocity impacts.",

          "abstract": "Composites reinforced by thinner fibers are intensively studied in recent years and expected to have better mechanical properties. With development of nanotechnology, the diameter of fiber can be as thin as several nanometers, such as nanofibers and nanotubes. Then, do these thinner fibers definitely result in composites with better mechanical properties? In this paper, the toughening effect of reinforcing fibers in composites is investigated based on the three-level failure analysis model. It is found that thinner reinforcing fibers do not definitely confer better fracture toughness on composites. The optimal fiber diameter is that making the failure mode just in the transition from fiber pull-out to fiber break, which is about 2-6. nm for carbon nanotubes and around 100. nm for carbon nanofibers. In addition, the effects of fiber, matrix and interface properties are all investigated, and their analytical optimal values are obtained and summarized in a table, which provides important reference for advanced composites design.",

In the model, transverse matrix crack spacing and change in debonding length between the fiber and the matrix is continuously monitored with increasing applied load. A detailed approximate stress analysis, together with a Weibull failure statistics for fiber fracture, are used to determine the probability of fiber fracture and fiber fracture location in the composite. Results of the model are consistent with experimental data. It is suggested from the results that the strength and toughness of the composite are significantly influenced by the Weibull modulus of the fiber and the fiber/matrix interfacial shear stress. A higher fiber Weibull modulus results in a lower composite strength while a higher fiber/matrix interfacial shear stress results in a composite with higher strength but lower toughness. A moderate variation in matrix strength and fiber/matrix interfacial shear strength does not significantly affect the strength of the composite.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the in vitro fracture resistance of endodontically treated molars with mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) cavities restored with two different types of fibers.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty extracted human mandibular first molars were selected for the study and randomly assigned to six groups (n = 10). Group 1 served as the control. In groups 2 through 6, endodontic access and standard MOD cavities were prepared. Following root canal treatment, group 2 was left unrestored. In group 3, the teeth were restored with composite resin (Venus, Heraeus Kulzer). In group 4, flowable composite resin (Venus, Heraeus Kulzer) was used before restoring the teeth with composite resin. In group 5, leno-woven ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene ribbon fiber (Ribbond) was inserted in the flowable resin in a buccal to lingual direction, and the teeth were then restored with composite resin. In group 6, translucent glass fiber (Vectris, Ivoclar) was adapted over the flowable resin in the bucco-lingual direction and restored with composite resin. The specimens were stored in 100% humidity at 37°C for 1 day. Compressive loading of the teeth was performed using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The mean load necessary to fracture the samples was recorded in Newtons (N). Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan&#039;s post-hoc test, where significance was set at p &lt; 0.001.\n\nRESULTS: The highest and the lowest mean fracture strengths were found in sound teeth (1598.8 N) and unrestored teeth (393.7 N), respectively. The mean load necessary to fracture the samples was 958.6 N in the polyethylene ribbon group (group 5), 913.2 N in the glass-fiber group (group 6), 699.7 N in teeth restored with flowable resin and composite (group 4), and 729.3 N in group 3 with composite resin alone. Statistical analysis showed significantly higher fracture resistance of both the fiber groups compared to composite resin alone (p &lt; 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: Both polyethylene ribbon and glass fiber under MOD composite restorations significantly increased fracture strength with no statistical difference between the two groups. Therefore, both polyethylene- and glassfiber- reinforced composites can be used for access cavity restorations in teeth with weakened cusps.",

Stress concentration and bending effects at the notch tip resulted in growth of the notch through fibers in a planar fashion covering the entire fracture surface, This was contrary to the case of an unnotched composite, for which two distinct fracture surface regions were observed as planar embrittlement tones at the periphery and fibrous at the center. Cracks in the notched composite were more closed relative to those in the unnotched one, except at the notch tip.

The oxidation behavior of two PAN-based fibers (T-300R and IM-7) was studied in the as-received condition, and after incorporation into the glass matrix, in order to elucidate differences in oxidation behavior controlled by differences in fiber structure and catalysis by matrix constituents. As-received T-300R fibers oxidized preferentially in an axial fashion from the fiber ends, whereas IM-7 fibers oxidized uniformly on all fiber surfaces. The oxidation rate for the as-received T-300R fiber decreased steadily throughout the oxidation process as a result of a loss of fiber mass, without an increase in the concentration of exposed fiber surface area. The oxidation behavior of the as-received IM-7 fiber was dramatically different than the T-300R fiber. The oxidation rate of the IM-7 fiber increased through 35% burn-off and then steadily decreased, corresponding to the decrease in fiber mass. Incorporation of both fibers in a glass matrix resulted in composites which exhibited similar oxidation behavior. However, the initial oxidation rates for the IM-7 and T-300R fibers in the composite were greater than the initial oxidation rates for the as-received fibers.

Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the load bearing capacity of fiber-reinforced and unreinforced computer-Aided design/computer-Aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabricated fixed dental prostheses. Material and methods Fixed dental prostheses were fabricated with CAD/CAM from 3 experimental fiber-reinforced composite resin blocks, 1 experimental composite resin block, and 1 commercially available composite resin block. The experimental fiber-reinforced composite resin was prepared by mixing dimethacrylate resin with filler particles of BaO silicate and E-glass fiber. Different ratios of resin, filler, and fiber were used to fabricate specimens measuring 15.5 ×19 × 39 mm, which were allocated to 5 different groups (n=8) and statically loaded until final fracture. Statistical analyses were calculated according to final fracture values. A 1-way ANOVA and the Tukey post hoc multiple comparison test were used (α=.05). Results All groups showed significantly different load-bearing capacities (P&lt;.001). Experimental randomly oriented fiber-reinforced composite resin blocks revealed the highest load-bearing capacity (2163 ±246 N), whereas commercial composite resin blocks showed the lowest (1290 ±172 N). Conclusions Fixed partial dental prostheses consisting of experimental fiber-reinforced composite resin blocks showed higher load-bearing capacities than did unreinforced composite resin blocks. © 2013 The Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

Plasma surface treatment of fibers is used as reinforcement in composite materials to modify the chemical and physical properties of their surfaces with tailored fiber-matrix bonding strength. Methods: Three different types of monomer 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), triethyleneglycoldimethylether (TEGDME) and ethylenediamine (EDA) were used in the plasma polymerization modification of glass fibers. A radiofrequency generator was used to sustain plasma in a glass vacuum chamber. Glass fibers were modified at the same glow-discharge power of 25 W and exposure time of 30 min for each monomer. Fibers were incorporated into the acrylic with 1% (w/w) loading except control group. Specimens were prepared using a standard mold of 3 cm × 0.5 cm × 0.8 cm in dimension with eight specimens in each group. Samples were subjected to a flexural strength test set up at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the microstructure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used for chemical analysis of the surface. Results: Data were analyzed by means of ANOVA and Duncan&#039;s tests. Test results revealed that fiber reinforcement had a significant effect on the flexural strength of the specimens (p &lt; 0.05). Among the fiber reinforced groups, plasma treatment with EDA monomer resulted in the most significant increase in flexural strength values (p &lt; 0.05). XPS results have shown an increasing number of nitrogenous compounds in EDA treated fibers. The chemical structure of the surface, especially with the increase in nitrogenous compounds could give an idea for the amine film deposition and SEM figures showed an increase in surface roughness. Significance: The results showed that plasma treatment with EDA monomer was an effective alternative method of increasing the flexural strength of PMMA based denture base polymers through fiber reinforcement. © 2006 Academy of Dental Materials.",

          "abstract": "Wind energy has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years in Jordan as one of the possible alternative renewable energy resources. Almost all of the local research and development activities in this field were directed to explore, develop and optimally utilize wind energy systems. The time has come to establish a link between the local scientific (academic) work and local industries to produce a usable technology which will increase the local share in an inevitably emerging wind energy industry in Jordan. To achieve this goal, a well founded manufacturing base is required. In part I of this research, two airfoil sections were chosen and the rotor blade was designed as a combination of these airfoils. In this paper (part II), the blade and the blade rotor will be manufactured, tested and its performance examined. The rotor was manufactured of GRP composite material and then installed on a 15 kW grid connected, pitch controlled wind machine. The blade has also passed successfully all required tests and, when installed on a functional wind turbine, performed satisfactorily with a favorable power coefficient of 41.2%.",

The experimental composite was made up by a methacrylate-based resin (50% Bis-GMA and 50% TEGDMA). Specimens were prepared for Flexural Strength (FS) (25mm×2mm×2mm) and for Diametral Tensile Strength (DTS) (3×6 Ø mm) and tested at 0.5mm/min in a universal testing machine.\n\nRESULTS: The results (in MPa) showed significance (different superscript letters mean statistical significant difference) for FS (p&lt;0.009) and DTS (p&lt;0.001) - FS results: F22.5/P55: 217.24±20.64(B); F25/P52.5: 245.77±26.80(AB); F27.5/P50: 246.88±32.28(AB); F30/P47.5: 259.91±26.01(A).

In SEM analysis, areas without fiber reinforcement demonstrated to be more prone to the presence of bubbles and crack development. The group F30/P47.5 showed areas with a great quantity of fibers without empty spaces for crack propagation.\n\nCONCLUSION: Increasing fiber content results in higher flexural and diametral tensile strength of an experimental composite reinforced with glass fibers.",

Phosphoric acid acted as the solvent of PA6, catalyst of melamine-cyanurate self-assembly reaction and reactant of melamine-phosphoric acid reaction. With the consumption of the acid, the pH value of the system increased, and the solved PA6 precipitated on the surface of the flame retardant particles to form polymeric encapsulation. This technology realized the synthesis and surface modification of the flame retardants in one process. The catalyst and solvent, phosphoric acid, was finally converted into the product MP, and need no an additional removing process. The encapsulated MCA/MP (EMCMP) composite flame retardants were successfully applied in the fire-resistance to glass fiber (GF)-reinforced PA6. Because the encapsulated layer of EMCMP was also PA6, good interfacial compatibility and effective dispersion of EMCMP in PA6 resin can be obtained, and the corresponding flame retardant materials showed excellent flame retardancy and mechanical performance.

A description of the creep behaviour is required when these materials are operated at elevated temperatures. This paper addresses a hybrid short-fibre-reinforced composite material which was substituted for steel in the fabrication of a valve component. The material was investigated on the basis of its intended service conditions. Creep behaviour of the material at high- and low-stress levels is presented in the form of strain/time and stress/time diagrams. A good deal of attention has been given to the extrapolation method which is shown to have an effective application for stage II creep. A creep damage parameter associated with modulus adjustment is proposed and subsequently analysed, thus providing an assessment of the composite creep behaviour. Finally, the creep mechanism is discussed along with a fractographic analysis.",

          "abstract": "A micromechanical model based on a probabilistic approach is implemented in the finite element code CASTEM 2000 to develop numerical simulations that efficiently predict the overall damaged behaviour of random oriented fibre composites. The proposed damage constitutive model is based upon the generalised Mori and Tanaka scheme and Eshelby&#039;s equivalence theory. Damage mechanisms occurring at each composite constituent (fibres, matrix and interface) are associated to Weibull probabilistic functions to model their onset and progressive growth at the microscopic scale level. It is obvious that the damaged behaviour of the composite material depends widely on the microscopic material parameters (fibre length, fibre volume fraction, fibre orientation,...). On one hand, the micromechanical model uses homogenisation techniques which enabled us to link these microscopic parameters to the material behaviour and to evaluate explicitly their influences. On the other hand, the implementation of the derived behaviour law into a finite element code enabled us to reflect on the effect of these microscopic parameters on the overall response of a simple composite structure presenting heterogeneous stress fields. In fact, the damage evolution in each constituent (local scale) and the related stiffness reduction are estimated at any material point (integration point) or node of the considered structure subject to a specific loading. Numerical simulations of a composite plate with a hole under in-plane tension were performed to validate the implementation of the behaviour law. Numerical results have been compared to experimental curves and damage evolutions monitored by acoustic emission techniques. Simulations agree well with experimental results in terms of damage onset and growth. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, wind turbines have been increasingly adopted as a clean power generation system on a global scale, especially in European countries. Many studies have been conducted focusing on glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) used for wind turbine blades. The fracture morphology of GFRP is dependent on various factors, such as load conditions, shapes of specimens, and manufacturing methods, in addition to the material properties and microscopic structures of fibers, resins, and interfaces; thus, the understanding of the mechanical behavior of GFRP is extremely important. Furthermore, fatigue strength and environmental effects must also be considered for the practical application of GFRP. However, there have been almost no studies focusing on both the mechanical behavior and fatigue strength of GFRP. In our study, an accelerated exposure test was conducted for GFRP and its matrix epoxy resin by using an ultraviolet (UV) irradiation device. Then, a tensile test and a fatigue test were carried out for the irradiated specimens to examine mechanical behavior changes in relation to the UV irradiation time and observe the fracture surfaces using an electron microscope. The test results show that the epoxy resin tends to lose its strength with UV irradiation while GFRP tends to slightly gain its fatigue strength with UV irradiation. This observation can be explained by concluding that the UV irradiation to GFRP reduces the interfacial strength between the fiber and the resin, resulting in peeling, which prevents cracks in the resin from growing across the interface.",

The TOL was measured experimentally for samples exposed at 180 ??C and 200 ??C for up to 8736 h, and measured values were similar to the modeling predictions. The glass-fiber shell functioned as a protective layer, limiting the oxidation of carbon-fiber core. A relationship was derived relating TOL to tensile strength of the hybrid composite.

          "abstract": "The development of synthetic materials and their use in tissue engineering applications has attracted much attention in recent years as an option for trabecular bone grafting. Bioabsorbable polyesters of the poly(alpha-hydroxy acids) family, and specifically polylactic acid (PLA), are well known bioabsorbable materials and are currently used for numerous biomedical applications. The incorporation of an inorganic phase, such as a soluble calcium phosphate glass in the P2O5 - CaO - Na2O - TiO2 system, into the polymeric matrix enhances the mechanical integrity of the material. In fact, the flexural elastic modulus increases from 3.2 to 10 GPa with 50 wt/wt% of glass particles. It also improves the biological behavior and modifies the degradation pattern of the polymer. The presence of glass particles accelerates the material degradation and induces the formation of calcium phosphate precipitates in the surface of the composite. Therefore, the combination of a bioabsorbable polymer such as PLA with a soluble calcium phosphate glass leads to a fully degradable composite material with a high bone regenerative potential. The success of a 3D scaffold depends on several parameters that go from the macro- to the nanoscale. The solvent and casting technique, together with particulate leaching, allows the elaboration of 95%-porosity scaffolds with a well interconnected macro- and microporosity. Factors such as surface chemistry, surface energy, and topography can highly affect the cell-material response. Indeed, the addition of glass particles in the PLA matrix modifies the material surface properties such as wettability AI (Area index or real-surface-area/nominal-area ratio) and roughness, improving the cell response and inducing morphological changes in the cytoskeleton of the osteoblasts. This study offers valuable insight into the parameters affecting cell-scaffold behavior, and discusses the special relevance that a comprehensive characterization and manufacturing control of the composite surface can have for monitoring the biological-synthetic interactions.",

The results of dynamic micro-debonding experiments showed that the values of interphase strength and specific absorbed energies varied in a manner that is dependent on the sizing and exhibited significant sensitivity to loading rates. The unsized fibers exhibit greater frictional sliding energies that could provide better ballistic resistance, while the compatible sized fibers show higher strength values that improve the structural integrity of the polymeric composites. In addition, significantly higher amounts of energy are absorbed within the frictional sliding regime compared to debonding. By using the experimental data obtained, a case study was performed to reveal the importance of the interphase related micro damage modes on energy absorption (and therefore ballistic performance) of glass/epoxy composite armor.",

The results indicate that with the introduction of PEN-OH the curing temperature of BAPh has decreased to 229.6-234.8 degrees C and BAPh/PEN-OH prepolymers exhibit large processing windows with relatively low melt viscosity. The BAPh/PEN-OH/GF composite laminates exhibit tensile strength (272.4-456.5 MPa) and modulus (4.9-10.0 GPa), flexural strength (507.1-560.9 MPa), and flexural modulus (24.0-30.4 GPa) with high thermal (stable up to 538.3 degrees C) and thermal stabilities (stable up to 475.5 degrees C). The dielectric properties of BAPh/PEN-OH/GF composite laminates have also been investigated, which had little dependence on the frequency. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy results show that the BAPh/PEN-OH/GF composite laminates display excellent interfacial adhesions between the matrix and GFs. Herein, the BAPh/PEN-OH matrix can be a good matrix for high-performance polymeric materials and the advanced BAPh/PEN-OH/GF composite laminates can be used under high temperature environment. POLYM.

          "abstract": "Statement of problem: Glass-fiber posts were introduced for use after endodontic therapy instead of metal alloy and ceramic posts. There are several new types of glass-fiber post systems available, but little is known about how well these posts bond to the root surface. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the bond strengths of 3 different types of glass-fiber post systems-opaque, translucent, and electrical glass-in 3 different locations of prepared post spaces. Material and methods: Sixty human intact single-rooted extracted teeth were used. The root canals were prepared using a step-back technique and obturated with gutta-percha using lateral condensation. The roots were divided into 3 experimental groups and further divided into 2 subgroups according to testing time (n=10). Roots were restored with 1 of the following post systems according to the manufacturer&#039;s instructions: opaque glass-fiber posts (Snowpost), translucent glass-fiber posts (FiberMaster), and electrical glass-fiber posts (Everstick). A self-etching primer (Clearfil Liner Bond) was applied to the walls of the post spaces, allowed to etch for 30 seconds, and gently air dried. A dual-polymerized bonding agent (Clearfil Liner Bond, Bond A and B) was then applied to the same walls. A dual-polymerizing resin luting agent (Panavia F) was mixed for 20 seconds and then placed in the post spaces using a lentulo spiral instrument. The roots were placed in light-protected cylinders; then the light source was placed directly on the flat cervical tooth surfaces and the cement was polymerized. Specimens were stored in light-proof boxes for 24 hours or 1 week after the polymerization procedure. Each root was cut horizontally, and six 1-mm-thick root segments (2 apical, 2 middle, and 2 cervical) were prepared.Using a push-out test, the bond strength between post and dentin was measured after 24 hours or 1 week using a universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was performed with 3-way ANOVA followed by independent t tests (??=.05) to detect differences between groups defined by the specific interacting variables. The different combinations of posts and luting material from the cervical segments were analyzed with SEM. Results: The 3-way ANOVA indicated that push-out test values varied significantly according to the post system used (opaque, electrical, and translucent) (P&lt;.01); the root segments (cervical, middle, and apical) (P&lt;.01), however, did not vary statistically according to the time of testing (24 hours and 1 week). Opaque and electrical glass-fiber posts showed higher bond strength values than translucent posts (P&lt;.01). Push-out bond strength values of cervical segments were significantly higher than the middle and apical segments in translucent and electrical glass-fiber post groups (P&lt;.01). In the opaque glass-fiber post group, there were no significant differences between cervical and middle segments. In SEM analysis, a distinct hybrid zone with long, numerous resin tags located between luting material and dentin was exhibited in all post systems. Conclusion: The opaque and electrical glass-fiber posts exhibited similar bond strengths, and translucent posts exhibited the lowest bond strength. The highest bond strength was observed in the cervical third of the post spaces for translucent and electrical glass-fiber post groups. ?? 2006 The Editorial Council of The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of sintering temperature on flexural properties of an alumina fiber-reinforced, alumina-based ceramic (alumina-fiber/alumina composite) prepared by a tape casting technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The alumina-based ceramic used a matrix consisting of 60 wt% Al(2)O(3) powder and 40 wt% SiO(2)-B(2)O(3) glass powder with the following composition in terms of wt%: 33 SiO(2), 32 B(2)O(3), 20 CaO, and 15 MgO. Prepreg sheets of alumina-fiber/alumina composite in which uniaxial aligned alumina fibers were infiltrated with the alumina-based matrix were fabricated continuously using a tape casting technique employing a doctor blade system. Four sintering temperatures were investigated: 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees C, 1100 degrees C, and 1200 degrees C, all for 4 hours under atmospheric pressure in a furnace. The surface of the alumina-fiber/alumina composite after sintering was observed with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). A three-point bending test was carried out to measure the flexural strength and modulus of alumina-fiber/alumina composite specimens. In addition, sintered alumina fiber was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). RESULTS: FE-SEM observation showed that alumina-fiber/alumina composite was confirmed to be densely sintered for all sintering temperatures. Three-point bending measurement revealed that alumina-fiber/alumina composite produced at sintering temperatures of 1100 degrees C and 1200 degrees C exhibit flexural strengths lower than those of alumina-fiber/alumina composite produced at sintering temperatures of 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C; alumina-fiber/alumina composite produced at sintering temperatures of 1100 degrees C and 1200 degrees C exhibit flexural moduli lower than that of alumina-fiber/alumina composite produced at a sintering temperature of 1000 degrees C. Additional XRD pattern of alumina fiber indicated that with increasing sintering temperature, the crystallographic structure of gamma-alumina transformed to mullite. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the flexural properties between the alumina-fiber/alumina composite sintered at the four temperatures. This indicates that the choice of optimum sintering temperature is an important factor for successful dental applications of alumina-fiber/alumina composite developed by the tape casting system.",

Polyimide composites are very attractive for applications that require a high strength to weight ratio and thermal stability. Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) has shown the potential to reduce the manufacturing cost of composite structures. Fiber metal laminates (FML) made via this process with aluminum, glass fabric, and epoxy resins have been previously fabricated at LaRC. In this work, the VARTM process has been refined for epoxy/glass FMLs and extended to the fabrication of FMLs with titanium/carbon fabric layers and a polyimide system developed at NASA, LARC (TM) PETI-8. Resin flow pathways were introduced into the titanium foils to aid the infiltration of the polyimide resin. Injection temperatures in the range of 250-280 degrees C were required to achieve the necessary VARTM viscosities (&lt; 10 Poise). Laminate quality and initial mechanical properties will be presented.",

Both thermal changes, piecewise uniform transformation strains in the plies and overall mechanical loads can be considered in the analysis. The thermal and transformation load contributions are decomposed into superpositions of certain uniform fields with mechanical loads. Release of fiber prestress is regarded as an equivalent uniaxial compression applied at the edges of each prestressed ply. Optimized distributions of fiber prestress are found in individual plies such that stresses in both laminate interior and at the free edges remain within allowable limits, while the applied mechanical load may change from zero to a certain maximum value. Specific results are found for cross-ply and quasi-isotropic symmetric S-glass/epoxy laminates under tension. They clearly demonstrate the substantial potential of fiber prestress in damage control and prevention in laminated composite structures. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Over the last decade, biology and biotechnology have witnessed an extraordinary development spanning genomics, proteomics, and metabolics. This progress was so rapid and definite that it not only changed the face of modern biology, but indeed altered the way day-to-day business is done in biology and related fields. This scientific advancement came with a need for concurrent technological advances. In this context, the ability to interface sophisticated devices with relevant biological microenvironments has emerged as a critical challenge. Already, novel biomaterials are on the horizon that promise to fulfill the rigid criteria of being both biocompatible under the conditions of a versatile range of biological applications and compatible with the increasing demands for miniaturization, integration, and throughput of future device architectures. As currently employed solvent-based polymer coatings are increasingly reaching their limits, a range of unconventionalmaterials, such as vapor-based polymer coatings, are discussed as attractive alternatives. One of the main features of vapor-based polyreactions is their versatility in synthesizing both simple and complex polymers with relative ease and at generally low temperatures. The advantages of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique also include control of the composition and architecture of the resulting materials, high accuracy, solvent-free environments, excellent adhesion, and the ability to accommodate custom-tailored surface modifications. For further illustration, selected examples of polymer-based surface engineering approaches using vapor-based polyreactions are discussed in this review. For instance, reactive coating technology uses CVD polymerization to deposit a wide range of chemically functionalized polymer coatings on various substrate materials. Its simplicity in providing chemically reactive groups and its applicability to three-dimensional geometries (e.g. for microfluidics) enables exact tailoring of surface properties and the preparation of biologically relevant microenvironments. CVD-based reactive coatings are compatible with soft lithographic processes allowing for patterning of proteins, DNA, cytokines, andmammalian cells.",

A comprehensive experimental program which involves 54 plain concrete cylinders was conducted in this study. The cylinders evaluated in this study, were divided into six groups, and each group contain a control cylinder without confinement to quantify the amount of gain obtained using the GFRP laminates. Experimental results indicated that the use of GFRP jackets substantially increases both the compressive strength and ductility of unreinforced concrete cylinders. In this paper, the influences of two parameters influencing the behavior of the GFRP confined cylinder is investigated. These parameters are: the number of composite plies (i.e. composite thickness) and concrete compressive strength. The results of this study showed that: (i) compressive strength and ductility of the concrete cylinders increases with number of composite layers; and (ii) effect of confinement is substantial for normal strength concrete and marginal for high-strength concrete. A semi-empirical theoretical model is also presented in order to predict stress-strain relationship of GFRP confined concrete cylinders. The model results showed an excellent agreement with experimental values. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Crack initiation and propagation tests were performed on unidirectional E-glass/polyester double-cantilever beam specimens. The well-known classical beam theory-based solution agrees excellently with the experimental results in the case of crack initiation tests. In contrast, the classical model seems to be inadequate for the evaluation of the propagation test data. The apparent contradiction was attributed to the fiber-bridging phenomenon. Thus, a novel beam model was developed, which accounts for the effect of fiber-bridging. Based on the solution of beam theory, the number of the bridging fibers and the bridging force can be approximated. The former reaches a peak value and decreases notably, while the force tends to a plateau value as the crack grows. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Two glass fiber systems, one processed with a vacuum/pressure system, the other by manual fiber adaptation, and a polyethylene fiber system were evaluated. Every group consisted of 12 crowns. All crowns were luted adhesively on human molars and exposed to thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML: 6000 ?? 5??C/55??C; 1.2 ?? 106 ?? 50 N; 1.66 Hz). The marginal adaptation was evaluated through dye-penetration and analyzed semi-quantitatively with a scanning electron microscope. The fracture resistance was measured using a Zwick universal testing machine. The highest fracture resistance was observed on the glass-fiber systems (FibreKor/Sculpture 1875 N ?? 596; Vectris/Targis 1726 ?? 542), though statistically, the polyethylene system (belleGlass/Connect 1388 ?? 620) was not significantly weaker. All systems exceeded the fracture resistance required to withstand the maximum masticatory forces expected in the molar region. The marginal adaptation generally had a tendency towards larger gaps after TCML. The crown/composite-cement bond deteriorated significantly after TCML with the manual fiber adaptation and the polyethylene fiber system. The cement/tooth bond strength depended on which composite-cement/dentin-adhesive system was used. Conclusion: The fracture resistance of molar crowns made of glass-fiber reinforced composite was higher than those of polyethylene fiber-reinforced composite crowns. However, there was no statistically significant difference. The marginal adaptation seems to depend on the fiber systems and composite-cement/dentin adhesive system used. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "A thermoforming technique known as stamp forming has been used to transform a pre-consolidated unidirectional glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (GF/PP) flat panel into a more complex geometry. To achieve this, firstly, two-dimensional half-tube composite parts were formed, mainly to optimize the processing conditions such as stamping temperature, forming velocity and mold geometry. The two-dimensional mold was kept at room temperature, whereas the composite panel to be formed was raised to a certain preheating temperature. The preconsolidated GF/PP panel, heated by contact heating in an external heater above the melting temperature of PP matrix, was then formed in the cold metal mold. Typical cycle times (including preheating and stamping) were in the range of 3-4 min. Secondly, a novel rod-bed mold was designed to manufacture three-dimensional parts using the same forming technique. Both halves of the mold were made of several tiny round metal rods in a metal frame. This rod-bed mold allowed to duplicate any solid contour by pushing it slightly on to the spring loaded rods. The final position of these rods could be fixed by forcing the side plates of the metal frame together. As an example, a saddle shaped, three-dimensional contour could be fairly well reproduced by stamp forming GF/PP composites with this rod-bed mold. The latter can have enormous potential in the manufacturing of medical devices such as adjustable prostheses or splints where only a limited number of parts with complex geometry have to be formed.",

The aims of this experiment were: 1) to test the effect of a high concentration of continuous glass fibers on the transverse strength of test specimens made of heat-cured acrylic resin; and 2) to determine the fatigue weakening of both unreinforced and continuous glass fiber-reinforced specimens of heat-cured acrylic resin shaped into upper complete dentures. Methods. A three-point loading test was used to determine the transverse strength of test specimens (n=30 per group). The fatigue test was the constant deflection test (n=10 per group). Results. The results revealed that, compared to unreinforced specimens, continuous glass fibers at a concentration of 58 wt% enhanced the transverse strength of the test specimens up to 146% (p&lt;0.001) and increased the fatigue resistance (p&lt;0.001) during 5 ?? 105 loading cycles. Significance. This study suggests that by incorporating glass fibers into PMMA denture bases, the strength of the denture can be increased. ?? 1994.",

The design concept and manufacturing processes of the thermoplastic bridge deck composite structural system are presented by recognizing the structural demands required to support highway traffic. Then the results of the small-scale static cylinder tests and the impact tests of concrete columns are presented, demonstrating that thermoplastic reinforcement jackets act to restrain the lateral expansion of the concrete that accompanies the onset of crushing, maintaining the integrity of the core concrete, and enabling much higher compression strains (compared to CFRP composite wraps) to be sustained by the compression zone before failure occurs.",

Only the in situ constituent fiber and matrix properties, including the S-N data under the same cycling condition as that applied to the composite and the fiber volume fraction, are required. A unit cell of the woven composite is subdivided into small slices, each of which can be considered as a unidirectional (UD) composite. The load shared by each UD composite can be determined based on an assemblage scheme, as long as the overall fatigue load has been given. The Bridging model is adopted to explicitly relate the internal stresses in the constituent fiber and matrix materials with the load shared by the UD composite, and further, with the overall fatigue load on the woven composite. These stresses are then detected using the maximum normal stress criterion of isotropic materials against the constituent fatigue strengths, and the composite fatigue failure (strength) is attained (defined) when a constituent fails. A plain-woven glass fiber fabric reinforced polyester matrix composite subjected to uniaxial and biaxial static and fatigue loads has been analyzed. Agreement between the predicted and available experimental results is reasonable. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three methods of  composite fiber placement along with siloranebased composite resin on cuspal deflection and fracture strength of root-filled maxillary premolars. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mesio-occluso-distal cavities were prepared in 60 extracted premolars subsequent to endodontic treatment. The remaining thickness of buccal and lingual walls at height of contour was 2.5 +/- 0.2 mm and the gingival cavosurface margin was 1.5 mm coronal to cementoenamel junction. Subsequent to measurement of primary intercuspal distances, the teeth were randomly divided into four groups. In group 1, the cavities were only filled with Filtek Silorane composite resin. In the other three groups, preimpregnated glass fibers were placed at gingival, middle and occlusal thirds respectively, and the cavities were restored similar to the group 1. Cuspal deflection was recorded in micrometer using a stereomicroscope. Fracture strength of the samples was measured in Newton subsequent to thermocycling. Data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey tests at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. RESULTS: The highest cuspal deflection was recorded in the group 1, and the difference between group 1 and other groups was significant (p &lt; 0.001). Fracture resistance in group 4 was significantly higher than that in other groups (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: In restoring root-filled premolars with siloranebased composite resins, cuspal deflection decreased with the use of preimpregnated glass fibers. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Using preimpregnated glass fibers along with silorane-based composite resin may lead to better results in cuspal deflection and fracture resistance of endodonticallytreated maxillary premolars.",

In the following study the authors experimentally tested three composite structures made of glass fiber-reinforced plastic, hybrid composite with a core made of the same material and face sheets made of aluminum alloy and a carbon fiber-reinforced plastic structure extracted from the vertical stabilizer of a military aircraft with barely visible impact damage and delaminations. The tests were performed using various techniques including PZT sensing, ultrasonic, thermography and vibration-based inspection in order to analyze the applicability of these methods in the environmental conditions of inspection of aircraft elements. The performed analysis allows concluding about effectiveness of the applied methods and their specific applications in non-destructive testing of composite elements.",

A fiber framework of the pontic was designed with three variations: with the main framework curved labially (FRC1), located in the center (FRC2), or curved lingually (FRC3). Each framework was compared with a hybrid composite FPD without any fiber reinforcement (C-FPD). A lateral load was applied to the three different loading points of the pontic 0 mm, 3 mm, and 6 mm from the incisal edge, each representing loading conditions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\nRESULTS: Localized high stress concentration was observed around the connectors under all loading conditions. In all FRC-FPD models, the FRC framework showed stress-bearing capacity for the FPD. The highest stress reduction ratio under all loading conditions was obtained using the FRC1 model. The FRC1 framework also best reduced displacement of the framework.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that the optimum design of an FRC framework is to labially curve the FRC of the main framework at the region of the pontic.",

At the same time, different finite element models with inclined glass fiber were developed via the ABAQUS Scripting Interface. Results indicate that Young’s modulus of the composites strongly depends on the fiber orientation angles. A U-shaped dependency of the Young’s modulus of composites on the inclined angle of fiber is found, which agree well with the experimental results. The shear modulus is found to have significant effect on the composites’ Young’s modulus, too. The effect of volume content of glass fiber on the Young’s modulus of composites was investigated. Results indicate the relation between them is nearly linear. The results of the investigation are expected to provide some design guideline for the microstructural optimization of the glass fiber reinforced composites.",

It is unclear how these post and core systems can withstand different kind of forces in the mouth. The purpose of this study was to compare the fracture strength of endodontically treated, crowned maxillary incisors restored with casting post and cores and glass- fiber post with composite core and to evaluate their mode of fractures.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty caries free, human maxillary central incisors with incisoapical length of 23 ± 1 mm were divided into two groups. After root canal treatment procedures and decronation of teeth 2mm above cementoenamel junction, Grope 1 was restored with glass- fiber posts and composite cores and group 2 received casting post and cores. Teeth were prepared with a circumferential shoulder including a 1-2 mm ferrule and 0.5 mm bevel; all posts were cemented with an adhesive resin and teeth were restored with complete coverage crowns. Loads were applied at an angle of 135 degrees using a universal testing machine. Compression force was applied until the specimens fractured.\n\nRESULTS: The median fracture strengths of groups 1 and 2 were 459 and 686 respectively (p&lt;0.5). In group I, all fractures occurred in incisal third of roots. In groups II, 40% of fractures were in apical third and middle of roots.\n\nCONCLUSION: Within the limitation of this study, the results suggested that glass fiber with composite cores can be used as an alternative to cast posts and cores in anterior teeth when creating 2mm ferrule effect was possible in normal occlusion. Clinical trial is required to verify these in vitro results.",

                        3 were submerged in warm water at a temperature of 125 ??F when they were under a four-point bending creep test. The results show that the micro-buckling of the embedded glass-fiber roving occurs along 90% the length of the specimen on the upper inner surface (compressive side) and mainly during the time between 5 and 100 h from the initial loading moment. The micro-buckling causes the steady-state apparent flexural modulus of the composite drop faster, and it also causes the plastic matrix local crackling which subsequently leads to the structural failure of the composite. The stress level has little effect on the steady-state creep rate. The results also show some evidence that the plastic matrix becomes more brittle when it is submerged in warm water for certain long time. From the results, it is indicated that the pattern or distribution of the micro-buckling is significantly different from that of short-term four-point bending test for the same composite materials, for which the fiber micro-buckling occurs locally only on the middle section of the specimen. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

One of the main disadvantages of laminar composite materials is their poor interlaminar shear strength. Recent work has demonstrated a method of Z-direction reinforcement of these composites using electrostatic flocking techniques improve delamination resistance and fracture toughness without degrading the composite&#039;s tensile strength or other in-plane properties when loaded quasistatically. The Z-direction reinforcement is accomplished by electrostatically flocking short fibers perpendicular to and between the composite ply layers. In this study, composite samples were prepared using the flocking method in two fabrication modes by the; so-called Z-Axis &quot;wet&quot; and ZAxis &quot;dry&quot; procedures. In this work, Z-direction reinforced composite panels (including a non reinforced control) that were previously projectile impact damaged were tested using established mechanical testing procedures. Damage areas were quantified and compared using image processing techniques. Three point bending tests were also conducted on these projectile impact damaged panels to determine and compare their bending toughness, strength retention and modulus. The results show that Z-Axis reinforcement by the flocking technique improves the overall mechanical strength and stiffness properties of glass fiber mat laminar composites. For example, ZAxis reinforced projectile damaged and not damaged glass fiber mat composite laminates are found to have flexural strengths 9% to 15% higher and a flexural modulus (stiffness) 22% to 26% higher than comparable (not Z-Axis flock reinforced) glass fiber mat samples. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.",

          "abstract": "The physical properties of composite solid electrolytes are briefly reviewed. The surface potential formation and the point defects equilibrium at free surfaces and interfaces are considered in frames of the unified Stern model. Special attention is drawn to true size effects due to the change of the bulk characteristics of ionic salts in the nanocomposites. The main thermodynamic reason of the nanocomposite formation relates to the adhesion energy, γ a. At sufficiently high γ a values, the ionic salt tends to spread along the oxide surface and to form a nanocomposite if the oxide is nanocrystalline or nanoporous. Analysis of the experimental data shows that non-autonomous interface phases, crystalline or amorphous, exist in some composites. The reason for the stabilization of non-equilibrium states is the complex influence of several factors, including the interfacial interaction between components, particle size effect, and elastic strains in the lattice of the ionic salt. The results of molecular dynamic simulations show that the main origins of the conductivity enhancement are the adsorption of ions to oxide surface with the formation of a space charge layer, the lattice deformation near interface, and an appearance of interdomain boundaries generated by misfit dislocations. The equations proposed earlier for the conductivity description are analyzed. Among them, the general mixing rule has a rather simple analytical form and provides appropriate description of the experimental data on both ordinary insulator-conductor composites and composite solid electrolytes in a broad concentration range. Main approaches for the improvement or creating new composite systems are analyzed. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",

Higher natural frequencies of vibration of tubes used in the converting industry is needed in the marketplace because of continued pressure for throughput productivity improvements. This study focuses on hybrid tubes with increased natural frequencies of flexural vibration. A manufacturing feasibility study is conducted which determined that the pultrusion method is the most cost-effective process for this purpose. To evaluate the proposed method, a series of production trials is conducted using 1-in. (2.54cm) diameter paperboard tubes as the internal mandrel with a thin layer (0.050in. (0.13cm)-0.15in. (0.38cm)) of FRP material pultruded on the outer surface. Trials are conducted with different FRP layer thicknesses, fiber architectures, and volume fractions. Bonding between the interface of the paperboard and the FRP layer is examined by a microscopy study, and flexural properties of the hybrid tubes are determined using modal analysis. Overall, the research project reveals that manufacturing composite FRP/paperboard tubes is feasible and that little modification is needed to the existing production machinery.; In addition, the process results in a highly cost-effective method to produce hybrid paperboard and FRP tubes with high natural frequencies of vibration.",

The theoretical parameters of a given reinforcement are usually known and widely used to predict the behavior of the material. However, manufacturing operations such as weaving or needling can produce deviations or fluctuations of fibers around the expected principal directions. These deviations can cause unexpected behavior of the material and should be taken into account in the quality assessment of the material. In this work, we propose an image processing approach to estimate true principal directions and fiber orientation distribution through image analysis of a single section of the material. The method applies to anisotropic materials with several main fiber directions and with cylindrical fibers bundled in threads. A thread-based labeling algorithm has been developed. It allows reliable estimation of the orientation of fibers and threads and provides directional fiber volume ratios.

Flax and viscose fiber tubular composite samples were produced by filament winding and their properties were compared with the properties of E-glass fiber composites. The flax fiber yarn could be wound to produce a relatively stiff composite tube but poor adhesion between the matrix and fibers affected the properties. The properties of the E-glass fiber composites were superior in comparison to the flax fiber composites. However, the results from the split disk tensile test were competent, although they were only 25-29% of the properties of the E-glass fiber composites. Water absorption and impact strength were notably the weakest properties of the flax fiber composites. The viscose yarn could be wound into a composite tube but the composite was too brittle for machining specimens. In order to develop the structural natural fiber composites, the adhesion and the wet-out of the fibers should be improved.",

          "abstract": "Statement of problem: Controversy exists concerning the use of fiber-reinforced posts to improve bond strength to resin cement because some precementation treatments can compromise the mechanical properties of the posts. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of airborne-particle abrasion on the mechanical properties and microtensile bond strength (MTBS) of carbon/epoxy and glass/bis-GMA fiber-reinforced resin posts. Material and methods: Flexural strength (??
                        f), flexural modulus (E
                        f), and stiffness (S) were assessed using a 3-point bending test for glass fiber-reinforced and carbon fiber-reinforced resin posts submitted to airborne-particle abrasion (AB) with 50-??m Al

                        3, and for posts without any surface treatment (controls) (n=10). Forty glass fiber (GF) and 40 carbon fiber (CF) posts were submitted to 1 of 4 surface treatments (n=10) prior to MTBS testing: silane (S); silane and adhesive (SA); airborne-particle abrasion with 50-??m Al
                        2O
                        3 and silane (ABS); airborne-particle abrasion, silane, and adhesive (ABSA). Two composite resin restorations (Filtek Z250) with rounded depressions in the lateral face were bilaterally fixed to the post with resin cement (RelyX ARC). Next, the specimen was sectioned with a precision saw running perpendicular to the bonded surface to obtain 10 bonded beam specimens with a cross-sectional area of 1 mm
                        2. Each beam specimen was tested in a mechanical testing machine (EMIC 2000 DL), under stress, at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min until failure. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD test (??=.05). Failure patterns of tested specimens were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: The 3-point bending test demonstrated significant differences among groups only for the post type factor for flexural strength, flexural modulus, and stiffness. The carbon fiber posts exhibited significantly higher mean flexural strength (P=.001), flexural modulus (P=.003), and stiffness (P=.001) values when compared with glass fiber posts, irrespective of surface treatment. An alteration in the superficial structure of the posts could be observed by SEM after airborne-particle abrasion. MTBS testing showed no significant effect for the surface treatment type; however, significant effects for post system factor and for interaction between the 2 factors were observed. For the carbon fiber post, the ABSA surface treatment resulted in values significantly lower than the S surface treatment. SEM analysis of MTBS-tested specimens demonstrated adhesive and cohesive failures. Conclusions: Airborne-particle abrasion did not influence the mechanical properties of the post; however, it produced undesirable surface changes, which could reduce the bond strength to resin cement. For the surface treatments studied, if silane is applied, the adhesive system and airborne-particle abrasion are not necessary.

This paper deals with the fabrication and investigation of hybrid natural fibre composites and compares it with other normal natural fibre composites like abaca and jute as reinforcements used separately. Mechanical characterization of the natural composite is obtained by testing the composite lamina for tensile, flexural, shear, and impact strength. The structure of the composite is such that, the jute fibre is present at the center flanked by abaca fibre on both sides. Glass fibre is used to laminate the composite on top and bottom, which improves the surface finish and adds strength. The natural fibres are arranged in horizontal and vertical directions to provide strength on all sides. The composite is manufactured by hand layup process and volume fraction of the fibres is up to 0.40. It is found that the abaca–jute hybrid composite has better properties than the abaca fibre alone in tensile and shear. However the abaca composite is superior to hybrid composite in flexural and impact strength. The internal structure of the composite is observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the fractures, voids and fibre delamination are analyzed.",

          "abstract": "We present comparative life-cycle assessments of three fiber-reinforced sheet molding compounds (SMCs) using kenaf fiber, glass fiber and soy protein resin. Sheet molding compounds for automotive applications are typically made of unsaturated polyester and glass fibers. Replacing these with kenaf fiber or soy protein offers potential environmental benefits. A soy-based resin, maleated acrylated epoxidized soy oil (MAESO), was synthesized from refined soybean oil. Kenaf fiber and polyester resins were used to make SMC1 composites, while SMC2 composites were made from kenaf fiber and a resin blend of 20% MASEO and 80% unsaturated polyester. Both exhibited good physical and mechanical properties, though neither was as strong as glass fiber reinforced polyester SMC. The functional unit was defined as mass to achieve equal stiffness and stability for the manufacture of interior parts for automobiles. The life-cycle assessments were done on SMC1, SMC2 and glass fiber reinforced SMC. The material and energy balances from producing one functional unit of three composites were collected from lab experiments and the literature. Key environmental measures were computed using SimaPro software. Kenaf fiber-reinforced SMC composites (SMC1 and SMC2) performed better than glass fiber-reinforced SMC in every environmental category. The global warming potentials of kenaf fiber-reinforced SMC (SMC1) and kenaf soy resin-based SMC (SMC2) were 45% and 58%, respectively, of glass fiber-reinforced SMC. Thus, we have demonstrated significant ecological benefit from replacing glass fiber reinforced SMC with soy-based resin and natural fiber.",

Main results are summarized as follows. (1) It was shown concretely that the broken component-induced debonding is encouraged and discouraged when the corresponding component has tensile and compressive residual stresses, respectively. (2) The feature of the damage- (breakage of fiber, breakage of matrix and interfacial debonding) -accumulation process and its influence on the stress-strain curve could be realized in the computer; the damages are accumulated intermittently, resulting in a serrated stress-strain curve of composites. In such a damage accumulation process, the existence of residual stresses change the order and location of occurrence of damages and therefore the stress-strain curve and strength of the composite. (3) The dependence of the composite strength on the matrix strength in the presence of residual stresses was clarified; the composite strength increases significantly with increasing matrix strength when the fiber and matrix have compressive and tensile residual stresses along the fiber axis, respectively, but only marginally when they have reversed residual stresses. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The influences of six parameters and their interactions are analyzed, i.e. peak cavity pressure, holding pressure, back pressure, screw speed, melt temperature and barrel profile. The results show that most of the molding variables, as well as their interactions, affect the properties of the composite. Fiber-length retention is not the sole parameter to be optimized; the matrix system is also affected by molding conditions and has significant effects on composite properties. The influence of the composite microstructure, which is controlled by the molding process, on the rigidity, strength and toughness of the composite is also discussed. ?? 1991.",

Existing simulation tools have the capability to predict the flow front advancement as the resin impregnates the fiber preform to saturate it, thus minimizing cost intensive trial and error approaches to successful mold filling. An important input to such simulations is the permeability of fiber preforms, which describes its resistance to flow. Permeability is a function of the fiber architecture and fiber volume fraction. Traditional experimental methods to measure permeability allow one to obtain a single value at a prefixed fiber volume fraction hence, if one wants to obtain permeability over a wide range of fiber volume fractions, a multitude of experiments are necessary. This paper introduces a novel approach to determine permeability over a wide range of fiber volume fractions in one continuous experiment using the same preform. Repeatable results for woven glass fabrics over a range of fiber volume fraction are presented.",

Methods: Forty-eight single-rooted human premolars were endodontically treated and prepared with standardized MO (mesio-occlusal) cavities. Eight teeth each received either no posts or were restored with titanium screws (BKS), glass fiber posts (DentinPost), or quartz fiber posts (DT Light SL). Sixteen teeth were restored with zirconium dioxide posts (CeraPost). BKS-screws and eight zirconium dioxide posts were cemented conventionally with glass ionomer cement; Panavia F resin cement was used for all others. The specimens were restored with direct composite restorations. Eight sound premolars served as the controls. After thermomechanical fatigue testing, the samples were loaded until fracture occurred at an angle of 45??. All specimens were evaluated for fracture lines. Results: The sound teeth showed the significant highest fracture load (792.50 ?? 210.01 N). The group restored with quartz fiber posts differed not significantly from the control. In the groups with fiber posts and titanium screws significant higher fracture load values occurred as in the group with direct composite restorations without posts. The groups with fiber posts did not show a more favorable fracture mode than the other groups. Clinical significance: The use of an intraradicular post in premolars with class II cavities can significantly increase the resistance towards extra-axial forces. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a computational tool satisfies the needs of nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures as well as the needs of the daily design practice. The method does not include any iterative procedure within its steps and thus it does not have the disadvantage of possible nonconvergence. On the other hand, it is fast and gives accurate results.

Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) play an important role in the fuel cell systems. A good PEM must meet a series of requirements such as high proton conductivity, excellent mechanical strength and stability, chemical and electrochemical stability, low fuel or oxidant crossover, and be amenable for fabrication into membrane electrode assemblies. In this paper, we focus on the recent advances in development of novel PEMs that work well under elevated temperature and/or low relative humidity. All PEMs described in this paper are divided into three categories: polymeric, ceramic, and inorganic–organic com-posite membranes. The Nafion membrane with structural and compositional modifications is the most promising candidate that can adapt to high temperature and low relative humidity operating conditions. Ceramic and inorganic–organic composite membranes display some desired properties, but the develop-ment of these membranes is still in early stages and further in-depth studies are needed. Possible approaches focusing on (1) improvement of proton conductivity and (2) enhancement of mechanical and thermal stabilities to improve the performance of novel PEMs are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, it has been found that some concrete structures, even for some high performance concrete and ready mixed concrete under good quality control, start to deteriorate long before reaching their designed service life. Cracks are found after the structure has been completed for a few years, which results in the shortening of service life and lowering in durability. In this paper, the influence on the fracture properties of fiber reinforced polymer concrete, FRPC, subjected to freeze–thaw and thermal degradation, is discussed. The study on the damage influence was conducted using a climate chamber to perform the temperature changes on the single edge notched beams. FRPC specimens were subjected to freeze–thaw and higher temperature cycles and then tested according to RILEM standards. To determine the stress intensity factor, KIc, critical crack tip opening displacement CTODc, the Two Parameter Method was used and the fracture energy, Gf of the specimens was calculated to evaluate the fracture properties of FRPC. Three-point bending tests were carried out on notched beams with a clip gauge attached to measure the crack mouth opening displacement CMOD. Polymer concrete was reinforced with short glass and carbon fiber with 1% and 2% in mass respectively, to determine whether the reinforcement increases the performance of the material. The fracture properties of FRPC are reported in such conditions.",

          "abstract": "The thermomechanical stability of a number of organosilane surface treatments for glass fibers was evaluated for use in a fiber reinforced epoxy resin. All of the silane coatings were found to improve the tensile strength of E-glass filaments, particularly at large gauge lengths. A phenylamino silane and an amino silane were particularly effective in this regard. The fiber/matrix interface was evaluated as a function of temperature and after exposure to boiling water using a single-fiber composite test. All silane coatings transmitted a higher interfacial shear stress than obtained in composites with no coatings, and in all cases the shear stress transmission was considerably higher than would be expected from the yield properties of the resin. Measurements of the glass transition temperature of the epoxy resin, as well as Fourier-Transform Infra-Red analysis, indicated modification of resin properties in a zone around the glass fibers. Each of the silane coatings provided more stable thermomechanical properties than those obtained with uncoated glass, at least until the silanes were irreversibly degraded by boiling water. A phenylamino silane provided the most thermally stable prop- erties. Finally, unidirectional E-glass fiber reinforced laminae were fabricated and the measured values of longitudinal strength were compared favorably to theoretical predictions.",

          "abstract": "In this research, a conventional propylene glycol-based unsaturated polyester is synthesized and modified with diphenylmethane-4,4′- diisocyanate (MDI), which leads to the formation of a hybrid polymer network (HPN). The effect of this modification on the mechanical properties is studied experimentally. The optimum molar ratio of MDI to unsaturated polyester which had the highest toughness is found to be NCO/OH = 0.45 using compression testing. In the second stage of the research, E-glass-reinforced unidirectional composites are produced with pure unsaturated polyester (UP) and an optimum amount of HPN. Tensile and bending tests are applied to the neat unsaturated polyester, the HPN resins, and to the composites prepared from these resin matrices. For pure polyester, the tensile strength at rupture is 27 MPa with a Young&#039;s modulus of 920 MPa, whereas the tensile strength and the modulus of HPN are 42 and 860 MPa, respectively. In unsaturated polyester composites, a tensile strength of 500 MPa and a Young&#039;s modulus of 27,800 MPa are obtained while in HPN composites, the tensile strength and the modulus are 685 and 26,300 MPa, respectively. Hence, an increase in toughness is achieved for both resin matrices and composites by the use of MDI. The bending strength and the modulus of elasticity are 60.7 and 2464 MPa for UP resin, and 65.7 and 2871 MPa for the HPN resin. The corresponding values for UP composites are 858 MPa and 29.8 GPa, and are 1141 MPa and 37.5 GPa, respectively for the HPN composite. © 2005 Sage Publications.",

          "abstract": "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Failure of a fiber post and composite resin core often occurs at the junction between the 2 materials. This failure process requires better characterization. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of 2 chemical solvents, hydrogen peroxide and methylene chloride, on the shear bond strength of quartz and glass fiber posts to a composite resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four posts (3 +/-0.1 mm in length) were prepared for each quartz (LIGHT-POST (LP)) and glass fiber (Cytec blanco (CB)) post. Posts were horizontally embedded in acrylic resin with half of the post diameter exposed. The exposed surfaces were successively ground with 400-, 800-, and 1200-grit silicon carbide papers, to ensure uniform smoothness. The specimens were divided into 3 subgroups (n=8) representing different surface treatment techniques, including application of silane for 60 seconds (S), etching with hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes (H), and etching with methylene chloride for 5 seconds (M). Silane-treated specimens served as controls. A dual-polymerized composite resin (Tetric EvoCeram) was placed in a polytetrafluoroethylene mold (30 x 2 mm) positioned upon the post specimens and polymerized for 20 seconds with a light-emitting diode (LED) polymerization unit. The specimens were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. Shear bond strength values (MPa) of posts and composite resin cores were measured using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post hoc Tukey intervals for comparison among the 2 post materials and 3 surface treatment techniques were calculated (alpha =.05). The effect of the chemical surface treatments on glass and quartz fiber post surfaces were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS: There were significant differences between the shear bond strength for LP and CB (P&lt;.001). For all groups, the application of H showed the highest bond strength values. There was no significant difference between the S and M groups (P&gt;.05). The SEM observations demonstrated that the fiber post surfaces were modified after chemical surface treatment techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The surface treatment of quartz and glass fiber posts with hydrogen peroxide significantly enhanced the shear bond strength of the composite resin tested due to its ability to dissolve the epoxy resin matrix used in each post. The lowest bond strength was obtained with M and S groups. Application of methylene chloride to the fiber post surfaces for 5 seconds was not effective in increasing the shear bond strength of the fiber post to composite resin.",

The radar absorbing structure (RAS) is such an example that satisfies both radar absorbing property and structural characteristics. The absorbing efficiency of RAS can be obtained from selected materials having special absorptive properties and structural characteristics such as multi-layer and stacking sequence. In this research, to develop a RAS, three-phase composites consisted of {glass fiber}/{epoxy}/{nano size carbon materials} were fabricated, and their radar absorbing efficiency was measured on the X-band frequency range (8-12 GHz). Although some of GFR (Glass Fiber-Reinforced)-nano composites showed outstanding absorbing efficiency, during their manufacturing process, undesired thermal deformation (so called spring-back) was produced. The main cause of spring-back is thought to be temperature drop from the cure temperature to the room temperature. In order to reduce spring-back, two types of hybrid composite shells were fabricated with {carbon/epoxy} and {glass/epoxy} composites. Their spring-back was measured by experiment and predicted by finite element analysis (ANSYS). To fabricate desired final geometry, a spring-back compensated mold was designed and manufactured. Using the mold, hybrid composite shells with good dimensional tolerance were fabricated. ?? 2006.",

In this study, a finite element fluid-structure interaction model was developed to understand the deformation and failure mechanisms of both monolithic and sandwich composite panels. Fiber (E-glass fiber) and matrix (vinylester resin) damage and degradation in individual unidirectional composite laminas were modeled using Hashin failure model. The delamination between laminas was modeled by a strain-rate sensitive cohesive law. In sandwich panels, core compaction (H250 PVC foam) is modeled by a crushable foam plasticity model with volumetric hardening and strain-rate sensitivity. The model-predicted deformation histories, fiber/matrix damage patterns, and inter-lamina delamination, in both monolithic and sandwich composite panels, were compared with experimental observations. The simulations demonstrated that the delamination process is strongly rate dependent, and that Hashin model captures the spatial distribution and magnitude of damage to a first-order approximation. The model also revealed that the foam plays an important role in improving panel performance by mitigating the transmitted impulse to the back-side face sheet while maintaining overall bending stiffness. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Surface treatments and sizing can significantly affect such interactions; hence, sizing or surface treatment selection may significantly affect resin cure characteristics. This is of particular concern in the processing of composite materials, since neat resin cure characteristics often will not provide the appropriate basis for predicting the cure behavior of the composite. In this work, the effect of several commercially sized S-2 glass systems on the cure of vinyl–ester resin was investigated. Generally, a significant increase in the cure rate of the glass-modified systems is observed. Furthermore, a relationship between the surface energy characteristics of the fibers and the degree of cure acceleration is established, and possible mechanisms for the effect are discussed. It is apparent that sizing selection can significantly affect cure processes for vinyl–ester systems.",

It was also concluded that the long-term deflections and the creep strain limits specified by ACI 440.1R-06 are conservative. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Root canals were instrumented and obturated with laterally condensed gutta percha and root canal sealer (AH26). Gutta percha was removed from the canals to a depth of 8 mm and diameter post spaces with a 1.5 mm were prepared. The specimens were divided into the following 6 groups according to the luting agent used (n=16): Group V, Variolink II; Group A, RelyX ARC; Group N, Multilink N; Group U, RelyX Unicem; Group P, ParaCore; Group F, MultiCore Flow. Each specimen was secured in a universal testing machine and a separating load was applied at a rate of 0.5 mm/min. The forces required to dislodge the posts were recorded. A 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the mean retentive strengths of various cement materials (α=.05).\n\nRESULTS: Significant differences were recorded among the 6 cement types (P&lt;.001). Three materials provided statistically equivalent mean bond strengths (RelyX Unicem, Paracore, and MultiCore Flow) that were significantly greater than for the other 3 materials.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Fiber posts luted with RelyX Unicem, Paracore, and MultiCore Flow demonstrated significantly higher bond strengths.",

The radius and depth of the defects were varied, and the significance of their effect on the results obtained was verified using the analysis of variance between groups (ANOVA). The analysis showed that the depth of the defects has a stronger influence than the radius, and that the interaction of these parameters is not relevant. The fractographic analysis showed delamination and clusters of pulled-out fibers as the main fracture characteristics, and that the fracture initiates at the internal surface of the rings. The distribution of the circumferential stress, calculated through finite element analysis, validates the fractographic analysis. The finite element analysis showed a significant stress and strain increase at the internal surface of the rings, close to the edge of the internal steel disks of the grips of the fixture equipment. The variation of both stress and strain is due to the presence of bending at this position. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.",

In this study, the mechanism of fiber orientation in a T-shaped bifurcation was investigated experimentally and numerically. The fiber orientation of injection-molded glass-fiber/polypropylene composite was observed by X-ray CT. Despite the symmetric mold shape, there was asymmetric fiber orientation due to the mold filling process. Fiber motion in the bifurcation was then analyzed by the proposed simulation, and the fiber orientation was quantitatively evaluated in each small region. The prediction agreed well with the experiment, and the associated mechanism of fiber orientation is discussed. Furthermore, this approach explicitly demonstrates the interaction between fibers, which is an advantage of the proposed approach. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

However, in the process of fabricating the composite, it is difficult to impregnate the thermoplastic resin into reinforcement fiber because of the high melt viscosity. Therefore, intermediate material, which allows high impregnation during molding, has been investigated for fabricating continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite by aligning resin fiber alongside reinforcing fiber with braiding technique. This intermediate material has been called &quot;microbraid yarn (MBY.)&quot; Moreover, it is well known that the interfacial properties between natural fiber and resin are low; therefore, surface treatment on continuous natural fiber was performed by using polyurethane (PU) and flexible epoxy (FLEX) to improve the interfacial properties.

Purpose: This study compared the sealing properties of 4 adhesively luted post systems: glass fiber, quartz-glass fiber, zirconia-glass fiber and polyethylene fiber posts. Material and methods: Forty-eight permanent maxillary central incisors were divided into 4 groups (n=12). Post space was prepared and each post was adhesively luted with 1 of 3 systems: a 1-stage self-etch, a 2-stage total-etch, and a 3-stage total-etch adhesive. The specimens were separately immersed in freshly prepared 2 methylene blue solution for 1 week. The cleaned specimens were then embedded in autopolymerizing acrylic resin. The teeth were horizontally sectioned into apical, middle, and coronal portions. An occlusal view of each section was digitally photographed with a stereomicroscope. The methylene blue-infiltrated surface for each specimen was measured and data were collected with software. Dye penetration was estimated as the ratio of the methylene blue-infiltrated surface to the total dentin surface. Nonparametric data were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test (α=.05). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compute multiple pairwise comparisons that identified differences among groups. Dentin-luting agent and post interfaces were evaluated with a scanning electron microscope. Results: Significant differences in adhesive and post systems were observed in all sectioned regions (P&lt;.05). There were significant differences between the apical and coronal sections of each post type, and between the following pairs: middle versus coronal sections of zirconia-glass fiber and glass fiber posts and apical versus middle sections of quartz-glass fiber and polyethylene fiber posts (P&lt;.05). No significant differences were found among post types. The variables of middle section and 3-stage adhesive produced significant differences in microleakage between the following post pairs: zirconia-glass fiber versus quartz-glass fiber, zirconia-glass fiber versus polyethylene fiber, and quartz-glass fiber versus polyethylene fiber (P&lt;.05). Conclusions: The 3-stage adhesive and zirconia-glass fiber posts demonstrated the least microleakage.

For that purpose, jute fibers were treated with argon cold plasma for 5, 10, and 15 min and processed for composite with unsaturated polyester resin. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph had shown the rough surface morphology and degradation of fiber due to etching mechanism causes by plasma. Surface properties of fibers before and after treatment were determined by mean of contact angle determination and fine structural details by Fourier transform infrared-spectroscopy (FT-IR). Plasma treatment resulted in the development of hydrophobicity in fibers, that is contact angle were found increasing with water. This could be due to the decrease in phenolic and secondary alcoholic groups or oxidation of basic structural component, lignin and hemicelluloses after plasma treatment as studied by FTIR. Rough surface morphology and development of hydrophobicity of fiber after plasma treatment resulted in the better fiber/matrix adhesion as revealed from SEM micrograph of plasma treated fiber composite. However, among all treated fiber composite, flexural strength of composite prepared with 10 min plasma treated fiber only had shown improve mechanical strength of ~14% in compare to raw fiber composite.",

In this study, the delamination area factor for GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic) drilling was proposed to quantify the practical delamination zone via digital imaging of the damage zone around the hole and by calculating the damage zone by pixel. From the tests, it was concluded that a higher drill feed rate reduced the delamination zone and the cutting speeds have no influence on the delamination zone. Also, the proposed delamination area factor was more suitable and useful for delamination zone evaluation than the existing delamination factor.",

          "abstract": "A group of glass-fiber-reinforced polymer composites with controlled morphology were designed and prepared by sequential compounding of poly(butylene terephthalate)/glass-fiber (PBT/GF) composite with a reactive elastomer, ethylene-co-glycidyl methacrylate (E-GMA), and/or polycarbonate (PC). The microstructures of the composites were characterized by means of AFM, SEM and thermal analysis. The results indicate that the glass fiber was surrounded by a dead layer of PBT. In the matrix, the E-GMA particles, of sizes varying between 0.5 and 1 ??m, were encapsulated by the PBT phase. The PBT and PC formed an interconnected phase structure with a PBT domain thickness of about 1 ??m and the PC domain thickness of less than 0.5 ??m. It was found that when the PBT/GF was mixed with the E-GMA in the first step of the sequential blending, the epoxide groups in the E-GMA tended to homo-polymerize through ring-opening rather than to react with the carboxyl and/or hydroxyl groups of the PBT. Consequently, a slightly cross-linked structure formed in the E-GMA phase, which kept the E-GMA domains to stay in the PBT phase during the second step of the sequential blending with the PC. On the other hand, the transesterification between the PBT and the PC resulted in a decrease in the PBT chain regularity, leading to a lower crystallization rate and formation of crystallites with low perfection. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The dense glass showed specific resistivity of 1440 Ohm m at 350 degrees C and activation energy of 71.7 kJ/ mol at 200-800 degrees C. These values were comparable to those for compositions of 25-35 mol% R2O in the R2O-SiO2 glass (R = Na, K) and associated with the enhanced migration of Na and K ions resulting from the substitution of Al for Si in shirasu glass and the relatively large open glass structure. A carbon fiber (40 vol%)/shirasu glass (60 vol%) composite was formed by filtration of an aqueous suspension and hot-pressed to full density at 1000 degrees C under a pressure of 10 MPa in a N-2 atmosphere. The specific resistivity of the composite was lower in parallel (0.04 Ohm m at 350 degrees C) than it was when perpendicular (14.6 Ohm m at 350 degrees C) to the direction of hot pressing. The activation energy when perpendicular to the direction of hot-pressing (68.5 kJ/mol) was comparable to that of shirasu glass. Little temperature dependence of the conductivity was measured in parallel to the direction of hot-pressing. The above results for the composite were discussed using the mixed conduction mechanisms of ions and electrons, which were affected by the orientation of the carbon fibers.

Accordingly, the need for accurate machining of composites has increased enormously. During machining, the reduction of tool wear is an important aspect. In the present work, a mathematical model has been developed to predict the tool wear on the machining of GFRP composites using regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) in order to study the main and interaction effects of machining parameters, viz., cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and work piece fibre orientation angle. The adequacy of the developed model is verified by using coefficient of determination and residual analysis. This model can be effectively used to predict the tool wear on machining GFRP components within the ranges of variables studied.

Bamboo fibers are extracted from its stem using retting and mechanical extraction procedure. These extracted fibers are used as reinforcement in polyester resin matrix for making partially green biodegradable material composite via hand lay-up technique. The thermal conductivity characterization of composites is investigated experimentally by a guarded heat flow meter method. The results show that the thermal conductivity of composite decreases with increase in fiber content and quite opposite trend was observed with respect to temperature. Moreover, the experimental results of composites at different volume fractions were compared with two different theoretical models (E-S Model and Rule of Mixture Model). Good agreement between theoretical and experimental results has been observed. On the other hand, the variation in thermal conductivity with respect to fiber orientation also showed significant effect on thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivities of bamboo fiber reinforced composite at maximum volume fractions are 0.185W/mk,0.189W/mK and 0.196W/mK for fiber angles of 00, 450 and 900 respectively. The results of this study indicate that the developed composite is an insulating material. Therefore, this composite can be used in building and automotive industry to save energy by reducing rate of heat transfer. Keywords:",

The distribution of the fibers and of the crystalline and amorphous components of the matrix phase, the melting temperature and the amount of crystallinity are related to the molding conditions employed and to the resulting flexural strength and modulus, apparent interlaminar shear strength and Young&#039;s modulus. Mode II crack propagation, either cyclic or monotonic, is strongly affected by the fiber-matrix interface and matrix morphology. The distribution of the soft amorphous PP phase in the semi-crystalline PP matrix appears to be the controlling parameter determining the fracture and fatigue resistance of the composite. The fractographic features clearly show the role that this phase plays during crack propagation. A relationship between the shear cusp size measured on the fatigue surfaces and the cyclic strain energy release rate is proposed.",

The results revealed that at filler content 3% of organoclay, initiation and propagation interlaminar fracture toughness in mode I were improved significantly by 64% and 67% respectively, which could be explained by SEM at given weight as well; SEM images showed that in front of the tip, fibers pull out during initiation delamination accounting for fracture toughness improvement.

Different aging conditions were selected in order to simulate in-service environments trying to obtain reliable results from accelerated laboratory tests. In water uptake experiments at 80 degrees C, the mass increases continuously, suggesting that an irreversible process occurs. In addition, samples aged in air at 80 degrees C exhibit a DSC endothermic peak that can be related to physical aging. The calorimetric curve for specimens water aged at 80 degrees C shows combined effects of water absorption and physical aging. On the other hand, while the independent effect of temperature and water aging on the composites mechanical response is only moderate, their combined effect seems to be dramatic. This result is mostly attributed to the weakening of the fiber-matrix interface induced by the water aging at high temperature, which consequently affects flexural and impact properties. SEM observations confirm the irreversible damage observed in water uptake experiments. Good interfacial adhesion between fiber glass and epoxy resin is observed for unaged specimens, whereas completely clean fibers are seen for specimens water aged at 80 degrees C, indicating that the fiber-matrix interface is completely removed as a result of this aging condition.",

Reported results include T300/epoxy as well as E-glass/epoxy hoop-wound composite rings. A J2 deformation theory of plasticity is employed in the stress analysis of the compliant ring while linear elastic response is assumed for both the composite ring and stainless steel. Two objectives are included in the current study: first is the study of the compressive strengths of hoop wound fiber-reinforced thermoset composite rings made by in-situ curing method and correlate the compressive strength to the processing parameters; second is the quantitative assessment of the effect of residual stresses on the compressive strengths of composite rings. Experimental results indicated that composite ring failed initially by shear mode at the outer surface and propagated through-thickness. The kink band formation, followed by the shear failure, aggregated the failure zone. Finally layer delamination developed and led to a catastrophic failure of specimen. Most of the reported compressive strengths of unidirectional composites are based on unidirectional laminate composites. The current study represents one of the few works involving the composite ring specimens. Experimental results indicated that the compressive strengths of in-situ cured composite rings are very close to the compressive strengths of unidirectional laminates. This indication suggests that in-situ curing method can be used to produce high quality composite structures. Also the compaction pressure is found to have great influence on the measured compressive strength.",

METHODS: The authors divided 44 teeth into four groups according to the type of post they would receive: parallel fiberglass posts, double-tapered fiber quartz posts, tapered fiberglass posts and two different types of parallel fiberglass posts. They prepared teeth and cemented posts with dual-cured resin cement. After the specimens aged, the authors conducted pull-out tests. For fracture testing, they loaded posts at 45 degrees in a universal testing machine. They determined load-to-fracture values and relative stiffness. They measured percentage of light transmission by means of a light microscope coupled with a spectrometer. RESULTS: Both tapered posts showed lower retention than did the parallel posts. Scanning electron microscropic analysis indicated that more cement adhered to the surfaces of the parallel fiberglass post than to those of the tapered fiberglass post. All posts demonstrated some plastic behavior, with the double-tapered fiber quartz post being stiffer than the others. CONCLUSION: Parallel fiber-reinforced composite posts showed better retention than did tapered posts when a dual-cured resin-based cement was used. Translucent prefabricated posts have limited light transmission. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Parallel prefabricated fiber posts luted with dual-cured resin-based cement seem to be suitable for clinical application in endodontically treated teeth that require post-and-core restoration, showing good retention and acceptable fracture resistance.",

          "abstract": "Recently, the design and the manufacture of light robot end effectors with high stiffness have become important in order to reduce the deflection due to the self-weight and weight of glass panel, a part of LCD, as the size of glass panels as well as robot end effectors increases. The best way to reduce the deflection and vibration of end effectors without sacrificing the stiffness of end effectors is to employ fiber reinforced composite materials for main structural materials because composite materials have high specific stiffness and high damping. In this work, the end effector for loading and unloading large glass panels were designed and manufactured using carbon fiber epoxy composite honeycomb sandwich structures. Finite element analysis was used along with an optimization routine to design the composite end effector. A box type sandwich structure was employed to reduce the shear effect arising from the low modulus of honeycomb structure. The carbon fiber epoxy prepreg was hand-laid up on the honeycomb structure and cured in an autoclave. A special process was used to reinforce the two sidewalls of the box type sandwich structure. The weight reduction of the composite end effector was more than 50% compared to the weight of a comparable aluminum end effector. From the experiments, it was also found that the static and dynamic characteristics of the composite end effector were much improved compared to those of the aluminum end effector.

The quality of the developed multiscale laminates was evaluated by non-destructive inspection techniques (ultrasonic C-scan and thermography), density measurements as well as optical and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The in-plane and transverse thermal and electrical conductivities as well as Short-Beam-Shear (SBS) strength were measured at different locations within each composite panel.

          "abstract": "This paper is an attempt to predict the elastic properties of plain-weave continuous fiber-reinforced composites by coupling data of microstructure analysis and mechanical tests with a stochastic and multi-scale finite element analysis. The difference of this study over the previous one relies in the fact that these microstructural data are used directly in the proposed procedure without any pre-processing. Thus, a random procedure is used to build the mesh of the representative volume element (RVE), the description of which is based on the mosaic model. The geometry of this RVE is described by a random choice of data provided by image analysis. Variables as the fiber modulus and the local fiber volume fraction are randomly assigned to each element of the mesh. Finally finite elements calculations are performed with the homogenization technique to obtain the macroscopic elastic properties.The results show that geometry fluctuations of the RVE have a significant impact on the material macroscopic moduli. Furthermore, the method is more efficient to predict the mean values of the elastic moduli than the experimental dispersions (NB: the aim of this approach is to predict the scatter of elastic properties. An elastic homogenization procedure is sufficient to obtain numerically &quot;mean&quot; values). The results also show that the variations of the local fiber volume fraction have a small influence on the elastic properties because the mean value of the fiber volume fraction over the whole RVE varies very little from a draw to another. Finally, such a proposed method if it is fully automated could be very useful in preliminary design because cheaper than to perform experimental tests.",

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of flowable composite or fiber use under composite restorations on microtensile bond strength of composite to dentin in Class I cavities or flat dentin surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four sound extracted human first or second mandibular molars were randomly assigned to two groups (Class I cavities with a high c-factor or flattened dentin surfaces with a low c-factor). The dentin surfaces were treated with adhesive resin and restored with resin composite using four different techniques (bulk; with flowable composite; with a glass fiber (everStick NET); with a polyethylene fiber [Ribbond]). After 24 h storage at 37 degrees C in water, the specimens were thermocycled 600 times between 5 and 55 degrees C. Microtensile test specimens with a 0.9 x 0.9 (+/- 0.1) mm2 cross-sectional area were produced, and bond strength tests were carried out at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Mean bond strengths were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni&#039;s test at a 95% significance level. RESULTS: Flowable composite decreased dentin bond strength in cavities with a high c-factor (p &lt; 0.05). The group restored with everStick NET showed stable bond strengths regardless of the effect of c-factor. Ribbond THM used under composite restorations increased dentin bond strength in cavities with a high c-factor (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Flowable composite decreased dentin bond strength in cavities with a high c-factor; however, using a glass fiber in combination with flowable resin, stable bond strengths can be achieved in cavities with a high c-factor. Polyethylene fiber in combination with flowable resin increases the microtensile bond strength to the dentin floor in cavities with a high c-factor.",

          "abstract": "The fracture behavior of injection-moulded polypropylene (PP) composites reinforced with chopped, short glass fibers (SGF) and long glass fibers (LGF) was studied in instrumented high-speed impact bending tests. Testing was carried out on Charpy specimens of different notching direction in order to elucidate microstructural effects. The microstructural parameters were included in a reinforcing effectiveness parameter, R, which considers the fiber volume fraction, the fiber layering and fiber orientation therein, and the fiber aspect ration and its distribution. From tests performed at -40, 20 and 60??C, fracture mechanical parameters such as fracture toughness, Kd, initiation fracture energy, Gd,i, and Young&#039;s modulus, Ed, were derived. A distinction was made between crack initiation and propagation stages based on the fractograms by using the ductility index, DI. Addition of LGF considerably improved Kd, Gd,i and DI, while Ed was unaffected when compared to the related values of SGF-PP. In addition, Kd, Gd,i and DI did not change significantly with temperature. A reasonable correlation was found between the fracture toughness of the composite, Kd,c, and of the matrix, Kd,m, by considering the above R parameter according to the microstructural efficiency (M) concept. The failure modes of the materials were studied by fractography and are discussed. It was concluded that the matrix fails by crazing, whereas among the fiber-related failure events fracture and debonding occur in the LGF composites, while, debonding and pull-out dominate in the SGF-PP. ?? 1993.",

However, for enhancing its properties in various applications, a proper characterization is very important.

Hybrid composites containing PPEVASH blend fibers display higher impact strength than plain carbon fiber composites but the performance is lower than plain PPEVASH–epoxy composite. The increasing of damping resistance and glass transition temperature, measured in terms of maximum damping temperature, of the hybrid EP/PPEVASH/CF composite may be attributed to several factors and include the interfacial adhesion PPEVASH fiber-matrix and PPEVASH-carbon fiber layers and the increasing of the crosslinking degree of the matrix, promoted by the presence of mercapto groups at the modified PP fiber surface. The presence of mercapto groups in the modified PP fiber also contributes for an improvement of the thermal stability, measured by thermogravimetric analysis.",

These formulations were photocrosslinked by UV-A radiation and characterized by tensile and dynamic-mechanical properties as well as by impact resistance. The two UV cured fluoropolymer compositions are high modulus (&gt; 1 GPa), polyphasic materials characterized by a fracture toughness higher than conventional polymer matrices, like epoxies and unsaturated polyesters. Unidirectional laminate composites were also prepared by hand lay-up and crosslinked both photochemically and thermally. Mechanical characterization of glass fiber-reinforced composites was carried out by tensile tests and shear adhesion measurements, showing a good fluoropolymer-glass adhesion strength (ca. 9 MPa). Surface characterization of composites by static contact angle measurements allowed the calculation of the total surface tension gamma(s) according to Wu&#039;s harmonic mean approximation. Surface tension is very low (&lt; 20 mN/m) suggesting a preferential stratification of PFPE segments at the material-air interface.",

An Sm3+ doped glass fibre and a high-modulus regenerated cellulose fibre were embedded in close proximity to each other in an epoxy resin matrix dumbbell-shaped model composite. This model composite was then deformed until the glass fibre fragmented. Shifts of the absolute positions of a Raman band from the cellulose fibre, located at 1095 cm-1, and a luminescence band from a doped glass fibre, located at 648 nm, were recorded simultaneously. A calibration of these shifts, for both fibres deformed in air, was used to determine the point-to-point distribution of strain in the fibres around the breaks in the glass fibre. Each break that occurred in the glass fibre during fragmentation was shown to generate a local stress concentration in the cellulose fibre, which was quantified using Raman spectroscopy. Using theoretical model fits to the data it is shown that the interfacial shear stress between both fibres and the resin can be determined. A stress concentration factor (SCF) was also determined for the regenerated cellulose fibre, showing how the presence of debonding reduces this factor.

The wetting behavior and the interfacial adhesion were investigated by conducting contact angle and interfacial shear strength measurements on fiber-droplet specimens. Depending on the fiber surface finish, variations in contact angle of up to 60° and differences in interfacial shear strength of up to 7 MPa were obtained. Slight variations in contact angle and interfacial shear strength were also observed as a function of the resin viscosity and the chain termination chemistry. These results are of practical relevance for tailoring the fiber-matrix interface, to minimize the fiber impregnation time during processing and optimize the mechanical performance of the composite during service.

A total of 30 children (23 boys and 7 girls) aged 6-8 years were selected for the study. Each of these children required maintenance of space due to premature loss of primary first molars in at least two quadrants. In one quadrant, a GFRCR space maintainer was applied and in the other quadrant a band-and-loop space maintainer was cemented. Patients were recalled at regular intervals over 12 months and retention of both the types of space maintainers was evaluated. The retention of the GFRCR space maintainer was found to be superior to that of the band-and-loop space maintainer, but this difference was not statistically significant. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",

FML plates were composed by two AA2024 Al sheets (1.6. mm thick) and one composite ply formed by two layers of unidirectional glass fiber epoxy prepreg and two layers of epoxy adhesive tape of glass fiber reinforced epoxy adhesive. The set was manufactured by hand layup and typical vacuum bag technique. The curing cycle was in autoclave at 125 ?? 5 ??C for 90. min and an autoclave pressure of 400. kPa. FML coupons taken from the manufactured plate were submitted to temperature variations between -50 and +80 ??C, with a fast transition between these temperatures. Tensile and interlaminar shear strength were evaluated on samples after 1000 and 2000 cycles, and compared to nonexposed samples. 2000 Cycles corresponds to typical C Check interval for commercial aircraft maintenance programs. It was observed that the thermal-shock cycles did not result in significant microstructural changes on the FML, particularly on the composite ply. Similarly, no appreciable effect on the mechanical properties of FML was observed by the thermal-shock cycles. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

Laboratory and clinical research evaluating glass fiber-reinforced composite prostheses used to restore and replace teeth has shown that these materials exhibit excellent mechanical properties and can form a chemical bond to resin-based veneer materials such as those used in the fabrication of certain types of implant prostheses. Two different designs of fiber-reinforced composite implant prostheses have been developed and placed in human subjects. One design (screw-retained, retrievable prosthesis) is used with implant abutments that allow for screw-retained prostheses; the other design is used with abutments that retain prostheses with a luting material. Both designs are described in this article. The prostheses have functioned well in a small group of preliminary subjects, but clinical trials with larger subject populations are needed to more completely evaluate the potential of fiber-reinforced composites in implant prosthodontics.

The influence of varying target thickness, plate diameter, and impactor radius has been studied and the results compared to those offered by plain composite samples. After testing, many samples were sectioned in order to highlight the failure modes under low-velocity impact loading. The FMLs absorbed significant energy in plastic deformation, tearing the metal layers and fiber fracture, and offered a superior impact resistance to the plain composite on which the FMLs were based. The perforation data were normalized by the areal density of the target and the superiority of the metal—composite hybrids remained in evidence. Increasing the target size, the plate thickness, and the indentor diameter resulted in an increase in the energy required to perforate the target. In contrast, impacting the square panels at the corner or along the edge of the target did not have a significant effect on the perforation response of the structures.",

It is based on the generation, manipulation and transfer of surface plasmons (SPs) that have the ability to manipulate light at the nanoscale. Realizing plasmonic applications requires understanding how the SP-based properties depend on the nanostructures and how these properties can be controlled. For that purpose composite nanostructures are particularly interesting because many novel and extraordinary properties unattainable in single nanostructures can be obtained by designing composite nanostructures with various materials.

Specimens were tested in transverse tension in an environmental scanning electron microscope. The specimens were tested in the as-received condition, after they reached satn., and 8 mo after they reached satn. Observations revealed that damage was initiated at the boundaries of resin-rich regions, regardless of the conditioning process. Anal. results obtained by linear superposition to det. the stress at the fiber/matrix interface revealed several interesting findings. For example, as moisture is added to a composite, the hydrothermal residual stresses in resin-rich inhomogeneities change from tensile to compressive. Assuming a const. interfacial strength, this should make it more difficult to initiate damage in conditioned specimens. As this was not the case, moisture appeared to have a slight degrading effect on the interfacial strength. However, propagation of damage away from the resin-rich regions requires a higher stress than that required to initiate this damage. Moisture actually helped to arrest damage growth causing the ply stress required to cause transverse cracking to increase with increased moisture content and with increased aging time.",

          "abstract": "FRC (Fiber-reinforced composite) posts have been used since the beginning of the 90s with the introduction of carbon fiber posts. Fiber posts are widely used to restore endodontically treated teeth that have insufficient coronal tooth structure. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the advantage of using FRC over prefabricated and cast metal post especially indicated in narrow root canals which are prone to vertically root fracture. The most frequent failure of FRC is debonding of a post at the resin cement/dentin interface. Bonding to dentin may be achieved by using etch-and-rinse and self-etch adhesives. The bond strength formed by self-adhesive cements is noticeably lower in comparison to the bond strength formed with resin cements applied in combination with etch-and-rinse adhesives. In an attempt to maximize resin bonding to fiber posts, several surface treatments have been suggested. Sandblasting with alumina particles results in an increased surface roughness and surface area without affecting the integrity of the post as long as it is applied by 50 microm alumina particles at 2.5 bars for maximally 5 seconds at a distance of 30 mm. The efficiency of post salinization is controversial and its contribution to the retention is of minor importance. Hydrofluoric acid has recently been proposed for etching glass fiber posts but this technique produced substantial damage to the glass fibers and affected the integrity of the post. Delayed cementation of fiber post (at least 24h post endodontic treatment) resulted in higher retentive strengths in comparison to immediate cementation and the best results were obtained when the luting agent was brought into the post space with lentulo spirals or specific syringes. The resin cement film thickness also influences the pullout strengths of fiber-reinforced posts .The highest bond strength values were obtained when the cement layer oversized the post spaces but not larger than 0.3 mm. The use of core build-up materials as post luting cements is not recommended. The use of FRC post, combined with proper adhesive cementation technique can give an excellent solution when restoring endodontically treated teeth that are prone to fracture.",

          "abstract": "Traditionally, capillary effects have been neglected when modeling the filling stage of Liquid Composite Molding processes. This simplification is justified because the inlet resin pressures are much higher than the capillary pressure. This simplification is also acceptable when impregnating fabrics in which their fiber tows saturate at the same rate as the bulk preform. However, this assumption is questionable for fabrics that exhibit dual scale in which the fiber tows saturate at a much slower rate than the bulk preform. In such cases, the capillary pressure can influence the time to saturate a fiber tow significantly and impact the overall impregnation dynamics. Since the flow front velocity inside the fiber tows is significantly smaller than the flow around them, it is important to include the capillary pressure that may aid the saturation of the tow. In this paper, we modify our existing simulation that can predict the filling of the bulk preform and the saturation of the fiber tows to include the capillary forces at the fiber tow level. Important parameters are identified and grouped in non-dimensional form. A parametric study is conducted to examine the role of these dimensionless parameters on the overall tow saturation levels. The modeling is extended to include the effect of entrapped air inside the tows on the overall saturation of the preform. An experimental technique using the optical properties of vinyl ester and glass fiber was used to qualitatively validate the proposed model. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Statement of problem There are few published studies analyzing the effects of different ferrule lengths of endodontically treated teeth in relationship to newly developed fiber-reinforced and zirconia dowel systems. Purpose This in vitro study compared the effect of 3 different ferrule lengths on the fracture resistance and fracture patterns of crowned endodontically treated teeth restored with 4 different esthetic dowel systems. Material and methods The crowns of 123 human maxillary canines were removed at the cementoenamel junction and the roots were endodontically treated. Three master tooth models were prepared to ferrule lengths of 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.0 mm to produce 3 master analogs. Each root was embedded in autopolymerizing resin with a 0.2-mm layer of silicone impression material to simulate the periodontal ligament. Forty analogs of each master tooth, with ferrule lengths of 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.0 mm were produced with copy-milling (Celay system). Each group was further subdivided into 4 groups of 10 specimens each and restored with 4 different esthetic dowel systems (quartz fiber, glass fiber, glass fiber plus zirconia, and zirconia). All dowels were luted with adhesive resin cement (RelyX ARC), restored with composite cores (Valux Plus), and Ni-Cr alloy (Wiron 99) complete crowns. All specimens were loaded at 130 degrees to the long axes in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min until fracture. Fracture patterns were classified as failures above or below the incisal third of the roots. The data were analyzed with 2-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests (α=.05). A Fisher exact test was conducted for evaluation of the mode of failure (α=.05). Results Mean failure loads (kg) for quartz fiber, glass fiber, glass fiber plus zirconia, and zirconia groups, respectively, with the 3 ferrule lengths were: 1.0-mm ferrule specimens: 98.09 ± 2.90, 85.36 ± 2.82, 80.24 ± 1.88, 70.11 ± 2.48; 1.5-mm ferrule specimens: 101.0 ± 2.88, 87.58 ± 2.83, 89.8 ± 2.09, 82.71 ± 2.14; 2.0-mm ferrule specimens: 119.5±1.78, 99.84±1.23, 98.6 ± 1.64, 95.42 ± 1.02. Teeth prepared with 2.0-mm ferrules demonstrated significantly higher fracture thresholds (P&lt;.001). There were no significant differences in fracture patterns. Conclusion Increasing the ferrule length of the endodontically treated teeth from 1 mm to 1.5 mm in specimens restored with quartz-fiber and glass-fiber dowels did not produce significant increases in the failure loads (P=.084, P=.119, respectively). No significant difference was detected between glass-fiber and glass-fiber plus zirconia dowels with 1.5-mm and 2.0-mm ferrules (P=.218, P=.244, respectively). However, fracture thresholds were higher for all 4 dowel systems when the specimens were prepared with a 2.0-mm ferrule length (P&lt;.001).",

Methods: Clinical crowns of single-rooted maxillary premolars were cut off at the cemento-enamel junction. Canals were prepared with Gates Glidden drills up to size 4. No additional post-space preparations were made. Roots were embedded in acrylic and canal entrances were standardized (depth 2 mm, diameter 1.75 mm). Three groups of 14 samples were treated as follows: (1) custom-made glass FRC post (EverStick Post); fibers 5 mm deep in the canal, (2) similar post-system as (1) with incorporation of a new type of glass fiber fabric, (3) no fiber reinforcement (control). Posts were cemented with resin cement (Panavia F). Resin composite crowns (Filtek Z250) were made using an anatomically formed mold. Static load until fracture was applied using a universal loading device with a cylindrical bar (diameter 2 mm) with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/minute (loading angle: 30 degrees to the tooth long-axis). Failure modes were categorized as favorable and unfavorable failures. Results: There was no significant difference in mean failure loads among the four groups (P&gt; 0.05). Favorable failures occurred significantly more often in Group 2 than in the other groups (P&lt; 0.05). The results suggest that an incorporated glass fiber fabric does not affect the load-bearing capacity of resin composite complete crowns on structurally compromised and non-vital premolars.

          "abstract": "This paper focuses on understanding the deformation and progressive failure behavior of glass/epoxy plain weave fabric-reinforced laminates subjected to uniaxial tension at cryogenic temperatures. Cryogenic tensile tests were conducted on the woven-fabric laminates, and the damage development during loading was characterized by AE (acoustic emission) measurements. A finite element model for progressive failure analysis of woven-fabric composite panels was also developed, and applied to simulate the &quot;knee&quot; behavior in the stress-strain responses and the damage behavior in the tensile test specimens. Failure of the epoxy resin matrix in the transverse fiber bundle was predicted to occur using the maximum strain failure criterion. The effect of strain concentrations due to the fabric architecture on the failure strain of the material was considered by incorporating the SVF (strain variation factor) from the meso-scale analysis of a woven-fabric composite unit into the macro-scale analysis of the specimens. A comparison was made between the finite element predictions and the experimental data, and the agreement is good. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Despite recent advances in adhesive dentistry, fiber-reinforced post/resin cement/dentin adhesive combinations are not able to prevent microleakage. While studies have examined microleakage in endodontically treated teeth restored with posts and cores, microleakage among post and adhesive systems remains a concern. PURPOSE: This study compared the sealing properties of 4 adhesively luted post systems: glass fiber, quartz-glass fiber, zirconia-glass fiber and polyethylene fiber posts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-eight permanent maxillary central incisors were divided into 4 groups (n=12). Post space was prepared and each post was adhesively luted with 1 of 3 systems: a 1-stage self-etch, a 2-stage total-etch, and a 3-stage total-etch adhesive. The specimens were separately immersed in freshly prepared 2% methylene blue solution for 1 week. The cleaned specimens were then embedded in autopolymerizing acrylic resin. The teeth were horizontally sectioned into apical, middle, and coronal portions. An occlusal view of each section was digitally photographed with a stereomicroscope. The methylene blue-infiltrated surface for each specimen was measured and data were collected with software. Dye penetration was estimated as the ratio of the methylene blue-infiltrated surface to the total dentin surface. Nonparametric data were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha=.05). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compute multiple pairwise comparisons that identified differences among groups. Dentin-luting agent and post interfaces were evaluated with a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: Significant differences in adhesive and post systems were observed in all sectioned regions (P&lt;.05). There were significant differences between the apical and coronal sections of each post type, and between the following pairs: middle versus coronal sections of zirconia-glass fiber and glass fiber posts and apical versus middle sections of quartz-glass fiber and polyethylene fiber posts (P&lt;.05). No significant differences were found among post types. The variables of middle section and 3-stage adhesive produced significant differences in microleakage between the following post pairs: zirconia-glass fiber versus quartz-glass fiber, zirconia-glass fiber versus polyethylene fiber, and quartz-glass fiber versus polyethylene fiber (P&lt;.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 3-stage adhesive and zirconia-glass fiber posts demonstrated the least microleakage.",

          "abstract": "Process-induced residual stress arises in polymer composites as a result of mismatched resin contraction and fiber contraction during the cure stage. When a curved shell-like composite part is de-molded, the residual stress causes the spring-in phenomenon, in which the enclosed angle of the part becomes smaller than the angle of its mold. In this paper, a new approach is presented to control and reduce the spring-in angle by infusing a small amount of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) together with liquid resin into the glass fiber preform using vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. The experimental results showed that the spring-in angles of the L-shaped composite specimens were effectively restrained by the CNFs. An analytical model and a 3-D FEA model were developed to predict the spring-in phenomenon and to understand the role of CNFs in reducing the spring-in angle. The models agreed with the experimental results reasonably well. Furthermore, the analytical model explains how the CNF-enhanced dimensional tolerance control is accomplished through the reductions in the matrix&#039;s equivalent coefficient of thermal expansion and linear crosslinking shrinkage. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Considerable chromatic changes were observed, especially owing to the UV radiation.

          "abstract": "Glass fiber reinforced cement (GRC) is a composite material made of portland cement mortar and alkali resistant (AR) fibers. AR fibers are added to portland cement to give the material additional flexural strength and toughness. However, ageing deteriorates the fibers and as a result the improvement in the mechanical properties resulted from the fiber addition disappears as the structure becomes old. The aim of this paper is monitoring GRC ageing by nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. Two different NDE techniques-(1) nonlinear impact resonant acoustic spectroscopy analysis and (2) propagating ultrasonic guided waves-are used for this purpose. Both techniques revealed a reduction of the nonlinear behavior in the GRC material with ageing. Specimens are then loaded to failure to obtain their strength and stiffness. Compared to the un-aged specimens, the aged specimens are found to exhibit more linear behavior, have more stiffness but less toughness. Finally, undisturbed fragments on the fracture surface from mechanical tests are inspected under the electron microscope, to understand the fundamental mechanisms that cause the change in the GRC behavior with ageing.",

Because of their geometry, these short fibers were named bone-shaped short (BSS) fibers. It was found in several composite systems that the BSS fibers can simultaneously improve both the strength and toughness of composites, and the mechanisms for such improvements vary with mechanical properties of the composite constituents. The strength increase resulted from the effective load transfer from the matrix to the fibers through mechanical interlocking at the enlarged fiber ends. The toughness increase resulted from one or several mechanisms, including: reduction in stress concentration in a brittle fiber reinforced composite with weak fiber/matrix interfacial bonding; higher fiber pullout resistance when the BSS fibers bridging a matrix crack are pulled out, with the enlarged ends attached and perhaps deformed; and plastic deformation of ductile fibers. Both experimental and theoritical studies have been conducted on composite mechanical properties and fractography, fiber pullout, and stress analysis. This paper reviews recent, developments in BSS-fiber composites as well as discusses current issues and future directions in this emerging field. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Results indicate emissions occur at various intensities corresponding to initial notch-length and imminent micro-matrix fracture.

Vibration welding parameters investigated were vibration time, clamping pressure and vibration amplitude. The effects of these parameters on penetration and lap shear strength of the composite were determined. It was shown that clamping pressure and vibration time should be properly selected to optimize the lap shear strength. Temperature measurements made during vibration welding showed the importance of these two parameters on the interface temperature required for proper vibration welding. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

          "abstract": "In fiber-reinforced composites, the interphase nanostructure (i.e., the extended region between two phases in contact) has a pronounced influence on their interfacial adhesion. This work aims at establishing a link between the interphase design of PS-based polymeric fiber coatings and their influence on the micromechanical performance of epoxy-based composite materials. Thiol-ene photochemistry was utilized to introduce a polymeric gradient on silica-like surfaces following a two-step approach without additional photoinitiator. Two complementary grafting-techniques were adapted to modify glass fibers: &quot;Grafting-onto&quot; deposition of PB-b-PS diblock copolymers for thin-film coatings (thickness&lt;20 nm) at low grafting density (&lt;0.1 chains/nm2)--and &quot;grafting-from&quot; polymerization for brush-like PS homopolymer coatings of higher thickness (up to 225 nm) and higher density. Polymer-coated glass fibers were characterized for polymer content using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and their nanostructural morphologies by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Model substrates of flat glass and silicon were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). The change in interfacial shear strength (IFSS) due to fiber modification was determined by a single fiber pull-out experiment. Thick coatings (&gt;40 nm) resulted in a 50% decrease in IFSS. Higher shear strength occurred for thinner coatings of homopolymer and for lower grafting densities of copolymer. Increased IFSS (10%) was found upon dilution of the surface chain density by mixing copolymers. We show that the interfacial shear strength can be increased by tailoring of the interphase design, even for systems with inherently poor adhesion. Perspectives of polymeric fiber coatings for tailored matrix-fiber compatibility and interfacial adhesion are discussed.",

The results indicated that the simultaneous addition of MWCNTs and BGE led to the greatest enhancements in the composite strength and modulus, demonstrating that their simultaneous introduction yielded a synergistic effect on the matrix modification for the improvement of the tensile performance of the GF/epoxy composites. The scanning electron microscope observations showed that the modified epoxy resins were substantially coated on the surfaces of GFs while the un-modified matrix was lightly attached on the GFs. The enhancements in the composite tensile performance were attributed to two aspects of enhanced GF strength/modulus and improved interfacial adhesion for the modified matrix compared to the un-modified case. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

These have been stitched to 3D woven carbon fiber face sheets and infused with an epoxy resin using a vacuum assisted resin transfer molding process. Sandwich panels with carbon fiber composite truss volumes of 1.5-17.5% of the core volume have been fabricated, and the through-thickness compressive strength and modulus measured, and compared with micromechanical models that establish the relationships between the mechanical properties of the core, its topology and the mechanical properties of the truss and foam. The through thickness modulus and strength of the hybrid cores is found to increase with increasing truss core volume fraction. However, the lattice strength saturates at high CFRP truss volume fraction as the proportion of the truss material contained in the nodes increases. The use of linear carbon fiber braids is shown to facilitate the simpler fabrication of hybrid CFRP structures compared to previously described approaches. Their specific strength, moduli and energy absorption is found to be comparable to those made by alternative approaches. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A solution to this problem is being addressed through the creation of nanoreinforced laminated composites where carbon nanotubes are grown on the surface of fiber filaments to improve the matrix-dominated composite properties. The carbon nanotubes increase the effective diameter of the fiber and provide a larger interface area for the polymeric matrix to wet the fiber. A study was conducted to numerically predict the elastic properties of the nanoreinforced composites. A multiscale modeling approach and the Finite Element Method were used to evaluate the effective mechanical properties of the nanoreinforced laminated composite. The cohesive zone approach was used to model the interface between the nanotubes and the polymer matrix. The elastic properties of the nanoreinforced laminated composites including the elastic moduli, the shear modulus, and the Poisson&#039;s ratios were predicted and correlated with iso-strain and iso-stress models. An experimental program was also conducted to determine the elastic moduli of the nanoreinforced laminated composite and correlate them with the numerical values. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A woven glass fiber reinforced plastic laminate of 9 mm thickness was prepared and drilling was carried out using a CNC vertical machining centre. The thrust force and hole quality machined during drilling were compared for each drill geometry. Zhirov drill gives the benefit of less cutting force, and best surface finish.

As more teeth are saved, the demand for functional and esthetic restoration of periodontally involved teeth grows. Once, these teeth were restored with full-coverage splinted restorations, whereas today, adhesive techniques provide less invasive and less complicated treatment options. This paper presents a novel adhesive combination of fiber-reinforced composite and prefabricated composite veneers to restore function and esthetics in a periodontal patient with severe bone and attachment loss. After successful completion of the periodontal treatment, fiber-reinforced composite has been bonded to the buccal surface of the maxillary anterior teeth in order to control teeth mobility. At the same appointment, prefabricated composite veneers have been bonded to the splinted teeth in order to restore esthetics. The final result shows full integration of contemporary adhesive techniques for single-appointment, minimally invasive treatment of a periodontal patient.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This paper describes the use of fiber-reinforced composite and prefabricated composite veneers for the treatment of severe periodontal patients with a minimally invasive, single-appointment technique.",

In the present\nstudy, in an attempt to better understand the shock-induced compression\nresponse of GRPs, a series of plate impact experiments were conducted\non a S2-glas fiber reinforced polymer composite comprising S2-glass\nwoven roving in a Cycom 4102 polyester resin matrix.

The history of the\nshock-induced free-surface particle velocity at the rear surface of the\ntarget plate was monitored using the multibeam VALYN (TM) VISAR system.\nThe results of the experiments indicate the absence of an elastic front\nin the shock-induced free-surface particle velocity profile in the GRP.\nMoreover, in the low impact velocity range, relatively weak late-time\noscillations are observed in the particle velocity profiles. Increasing\nthe amplitude of the shock-induced compression resulted in a decrease\nin the rise-time of the shock wave front. The critical shock stress\namplitude at which a clear shock-front is seen to develop during the\nshock loading was determined to be between 1.5 and 2.0 GPa. The results\nof the experiments are used to obtain the equation of state of the GRP\nin the stress range 0.04-20 GPa. Moreover, the Hugoniot curve (Hugoniot\nstress versus Hugoniot strain) was calculated using the\nRankine-Hugoniot relationships; the departure of the Hugoniot stress\nversus the particle velocity curve from linearity allowed the\nestimation of the Hugoniot elastic limit of the GRP to be about 1.6\nGPa.

Therefore, a high dynamic stiffness for the headstocks of machine tool structures is essential to improve their performance. Since the dynamic stiffness is proportional to the static stiffness and damping, a high degree of damping is indispensable for precision grinding machines, especially when machining hard and brittle materials such as glasses and ceramics, i.e. small vibrations may affect the machined surface quality. Since fiber-reinforced composite materials have a high specific modulus, high damping and low thermal expansion it is predicted that the headstock dynamic and thermal characteristics will be improved when such materials are utilized in their manufacture.

Conventional piling materials such as concrete, steel and timber deteriorate in the marine environment and in corrosive soils. Recently the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) wraps has become quite apparent as repair materials to rehabilitate piles in such conditions. Millions of dollars are spent each year to carry out these rehabilitation works or to replace damaged piles. FRP composites are used in a wide range of structural applications where high strength, corrosion resistance and long term durability are of primary importance in harsh operating environments. Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composite piles could therefore be a possible alternative to overcome the continuous degradation of conventional piles. The present study incorporates an experimental investigation of the lateral load capacity of GFRP composite piles.

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the influence of retainer design on the strength of two-unit cantilever resin-bonded glass fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) fixed dental prostheses (FDP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four retainer designs were tested: a proximal box, a step-box, a dual wing, and a step-box-wing. Of each design on 8 human mandibular molars, FRC-FDPs of a premolar size were produced. The FRC framework was made of resin impregnated unidirectional glass fibers (Estenia C&amp;B EG Fiber, Kuraray) and veneered with hybrid resin composite (Estenia C&amp;B, Kuraray). Panavia F 2.0 (Kuraray) was used as resin luting cement. FRC-FDPs were loaded to failure in a universal testing machine. One-way ANOVA and Tukey&#039;s post-hoc test were used to evaluate the data. The four designs were analyzed with finite element analysis (FEA) to reveal the stress distribution within the tooth/restoration complex. RESULTS: Significantly lower fracture strengths were observed with inlay-retained FDPs (proximal box: 300 +/- 65 N; step-box: 309 +/- 37 N) compared to wing-retained FDPs (p &lt; 0.05) (step-box-wing: 662 +/- 99 N; dual wing: 697 +/- 67 N). Proximal-box-, step-box-, and step-box-wing-retained FDPs mainly failed with catastrophic cusp fracture (proximal box 100%, step-box 100%, and step-box-wing 75%), while dual-wing-retained FDPs mainly failed at the adhesive interface and/or due to pontic failure (75%). FEA showed more favorable stress distributions within the tooth/restoration complex for dual wing retainers. CONCLUSION: A dual-wing retainer is the optimal design for replacement of a single premolar by means of a two-unit cantilever FRC-FDPs.",

However, the decreases in eel resources have been a serious concern in recent years. The catches of glass eels as seedlings for aquaculture have shown a long-term decrease in both Europe and East Asia. To increase eel resources, the development of techniques for artificial induction of maturation and spawning and rearing their larvae have been eagerly desired. Recent progress of reproductive physiology of fish, especially mechanisms of oocyte maturation and ovulation in female and of spermatozoa maturation in male, facilitate to establish techniques for hormonal induction of maturation and spawning in sexually immature eels. With persistent effort to development of rearing techniques of larvae, we have first succeeded to produce glass eel. These applied techniques are may contribute to understand the basic reproductive physiology of the eel.",

It was observed that as the exposure time to sunlight, ultraviolet radiation and dust increases the mechanical properties of GRP materials decrease. The effects of relative humidity (%RH) on the mechanical properties were also studied. It was found that as the relative humidity increased in the atmosphere during the exposure time, the tensile strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity are lowered.

          "abstract": "Efforts are currently devoted to the development of numerical tools for predicting the forming process of continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites. To ensure good predictions, reliable experimental measurements of the laminate properties must be performed at the processing temperature. This paper presents experimental results of the intraply shear properties measured on a polypropylene/glass fabric using two different methods known as the bias-extension and the picture-frame testing methods. Based on kinematic equations, both methods of measurement are discussed in regards to their respective weaknesses, mainly related to the difficulty to measure precise shear angles in the bias-extension method and the undesired fiber tension invalidating the load-displacement curve in the picture-frame test. To remove these difficulties, a modified version of the picture-frame test is proposed. This new method avoids fiber tensioning during testing and is considered more appropriate to capture the influence of the fabric architecture on the measured properties. Good correlations between the load-displacement curves and viscosities measured with the modified picture-frame and bias-extension methods were obtained compared to the standard picture-frame method. 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The results show that, the friction-reducing and anti-wear properties of the PTFE composite filled with modified glass fiber are enhanced, compared with that of the PTFE composite filled with unmodified glass fiber. The effect of RES is the most obvious, that of SGS/RES is the second, and that of SGS the third. The wear of the PTFE composite, filled with glass fiber modified with rare earths, is characterized by slight wear under oil lubrication. This is attributed to that using rare earths to. modify the glass fiber surface can largely improve the interfacial adhesion between the glass fiber and PTFE.

Vectris and FibreKor, as well as an experimental material, were the glass-fibre-reinforced framework materials used. Targis, Sculpture and Estenia were the types of particulate filler composites veneered onto frameworks. Specimens were fabricated from each material, 0.5 and 1.0 mm thick. In addition, laminate specimens, 1.5 mm thick, were fabricated. The translucency of each specimen was evaluated by determining its contrast ratio. The laminate specimens were examined for colour differences. The experimental framework material was more translucent than the enamel composite when it was not coloured, and was nearly as translucent as the dentine composite when coloured. The commercial tooth-coloured framework materials were nearly as translucent as the dentine composite. It was found that it was possible to reproduce the same colour as the veneering dentine composite, when the framework thickness was 0.5 mm, except in the case of FibreKor. Within the limitations of this study, tooth-coloured, glass-fibre-reinforced framework materials are nearly as translucent as the veneering dentine composite, but these materials affect the colour of the prosthesis if the thickness of the framework material is increased beyond a certain point.",

As control materials, particulate filler composite resin and unfilled dimethacrylate monomer resin were used. Two uniaxial strain gages (gage length 2mm) were used to measure shrinkage strains in two directions: longitudinally and transversally to the fiber direction. The uncured composite or resin was placed on top of the strain gages, covered with a separating sheet and a glass plate, and irradiated for 40s with a light-curing unit. The shrinkage strain was monitored for 300 s. ANOVA and Tukey&#039;s posthoc test were used at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nRESULTS: ANOVA revealed that orientation of fiber and brand of material had a significant effect (P&lt;0.05) on shrinkage strain. The unidirectional FRC revealed no shrinkage longitudinally to the fiber direction, whereas the shrinkage occurred transversally to the fiber direction. Particulate filler composite resin and unfilled resin revealed equal shrinkage strain in both of the measured directions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: Anisotropic nature of FRC exists with regard to polymerization shrinkage strain. The variation of polymerization shrinkage strains of FRC compared to those of particulate filler composites and unfilled resin might be important for future clinical applications.",

Interface properties are extracted by comparison between experimental and numerical results. Details of the physical process are analyzed by investigating numerically the propagation and evolution of the axial stress along the entire system.

The tensile properties of these composites were investigated taking into account the effect of the hybridization by these two types of short fibers. It was noted that the tensile strength and modulus of the hybrid composites increase while the failure strain of the hybrid composites decreases with increasing the relative carbon fiber volume fraction in the mixture. The hybrid effects for the tensile strength and modulus were studied by the rule of hybrid mixtures (RoHM) using the tensile strength and modulus of single-fiber composites, respectively. It was observed that the strength shows a positive deviation from that predicted by the RoHM and hence exhibits a positive hybrid effect. However, the values of the tensile modulus are close to those predicted by the RoHM and thus the modulus shows no existence of a hybrid effect. Moreover, the failure strains of the hybrid composites were found to be higher than the failure strain of the single carbon fiber-reinforced composite, indicating that a positive hybrid effect exists. Explanations for the hybrid effects on the tensile strength and failure strain were finally presented.",

Tensile strength and elastic modulus of BFRP and BGRP samples have shown moderate reduction after aging at 25degreesC after 6 months, however, they were reduced considerably after aging at 75degreesC for 3 months. Moisture absorption and tensile strength degradation are suppressed by using maleic anhydride polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent in both types of composite systems. BFRP and BGRP samples were also loaded cyclically at maximum cyclic load of 35, 50, 65, and 80% of their ultimate tensile stress.

For this reason, glass plies are usually laminated with polymeric interlayers that can maintain coherent fragments after glass breakage, so avoiding sudden collapse (fail-safe response). However, the safety performance disappears if the connection to the rear load-bearing structure is not able to retain the panels in their place after glass breakage. To this aim, an innovative point-fixing system for frameless glass glazing has been developed, that exploits the enhanced mechanical properties of a new generation of ionoplast polymer interlayers. Bending tests on small scale glass beams have been performed at various levels of loading, temperature and aging. Laminated glass connected with the new device exhibit a noteworthy resistance and interesting post-glass-breakage performances. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The influence of fiber type (i.e., bagasse, rice straw, rice husk, and pine fiber) and loading level of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) block copolymer on composite properties was investigated. Mechanical analysis showed that storage modulus and tensile strength increased with fiber loading at the 30% level for all composites, but there was little difference in both properties among the composites from various fiber types. The use of SEBS decreased storage moduli, but enhanced tensile strength of the composites. The addition of fiber impaired impact strength of the composites, and the use of SEBS led to little change of the property for most of the composites. The addition of fiber to PVC matrix increased glass transition temperature (T g), but lowered degradation temperature (T d) and thermal activation energy (E a). After being immersed in water for four weeks, PVC/rice husk composites presented relatively smaller water absorption (WA) and thickness swelling (TS) rate compared with other composites.

The empirical relationship has been developed by using response surface methodology. The developed model can be effectively used to predict the delamination in drilling of GFRP composites within the factors and their limits are studied. The result indicated that the increase in feed rate and drill diameter increases the delamination size whereas there is no clear effect is observed for fiber orientation angle.

For a material that degrades, the main advantage is that an implant would not necessitate a second surgical event for removal. In this study, fibers produced from a quaternary phosphate-based glass (PBG) in the system 50P2O5-40CaO-5Na2O-5Fe2O3 were used to reinforce PLA polymer. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of screw holes in a range of PBG-reinforced PLA composites with varying fiber layup and volume fraction. The flexural properties obtained showed that the strength and modulus values increased with increasing fiber volume fraction; from 96 MPa to 320 MPa for strength and between 4 GPa and 24 GPa for modulus. Furthermore, utilizing a larger number of thinner unidirectional (UD) fiber prepreg layers provided a significant increase in mechanical properties, which was attributed to enhanced wet out and thus better fiber dispersion during production. The effect of gamma sterilization via flexural tests showed no statistically significant difference between the sterilized and nonsterilized samples, with the exception of the modulus values for samples with screw holes. Degradation profiles revealed that samples with screw holes degraded faster than those without screw holes due to an increased surface area for the plates with screw holes in PBS up to 30 days. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed fiber pullout before and after degradation. Compared with various fiber impregnation samples, with 25% volume fraction, 8 thinner unidirectional prepreg stacked samples had the shortest fiber pull-out lengths in comparison to the other samples investigated.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Water sorption, flexural properties, bonding properties, and elemental composition of photopolymerizable resin-impregnated fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) materials (everStick C&amp;B and BR-100) (FPD) were evaluated in this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bar-shaped specimens (2 x 2 x 25 mm) were prepared for water sorption and flexural strength testing. The specimens (n = 6) were polymerized either with a hand light-curing unit for 40 s or, additionally, in a light-curing oven for 20 min and stored in water for 30 days. Water sorption was measured during this time, followed by measurements of flexural strength and modulus. A shear bond strength test was performed to determine the bonding characteristics of polymerized FRC to composite resin luting cement (Panavia-F), (n = 15). The cement was bonded to the FRC substrate and the specimens were thermocycled 5000 times (5-55 degrees C) in water. SEM/EDS were analyzed to evaluate the elemental composition of the glass fibers and the fiber distribution in cross section. RESULTS: ANOVA showed significant differences in water sorption according to brand (p &lt; 0.05). Water sorption of everStick C&amp;B was 1.86 wt% (hand-unit polymerized) and 1.94 wt% (oven polymerized), whereas BR-100 was 1.07 wt% and 1.17 wt%, respectively. The flexural strength of everStick C&amp;B after 30 days&#039; water storage was 559 MPa (hand-unit polymerized) and 796 MPa (oven-polymerized); for BR-100, the values were 547 MPa and 689 MPa, respectively. Mean shear bond strength of composite resin cement to the FRC varied between 20.1 and 23.7 MPa, showing no statistical difference between the materials. SEM/EDS analysis revealed that fibers of both FRC materials consist of the same oxides (SiO2, CaO, and Al2O3) in ratios. The distribution of fibers in the cross section of specimens was more evenly distributed in everStick C&amp;B than in BR-100. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that there are some differences in the tested properties of the FRC materials.",

A program code for the automatic generation of 3D micromechanical unit cell models of composites with damageable elements is developed, and used in the numerical experiments. The effect of the statistical variability of fiber strengths, viscosity of the polymer matrix as well as the interaction between the damage processes in matrix, fibers and interface are investigated numerically. It is demonstrated that fibers with constant strength ensure higher strength of a composite at the pre-critical load, while the fibers with randomly distributed strengths lead to the higher strength of the composite at post-critical loads. In the case of randomly distributed fiber strengths, the damage growth in fibers seems to be almost independent from the crack length in matrix, while the influence of matrix cracks on the beginning of fiber cracking is clearly seen for the case of the constant fiber strength. Competition between the matrix cracking and interface debonding was observed in the simulations: in the areas with intensive interface cracking, both fiber fracture and the matrix cracking are delayed. Reversely, in the area, where a long matrix crack is formed, the fiber cracking does not lead to the interface damage. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Developed in Australia in the early 1990s and subsequently adopted by other countries, including China and India, this material is used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. GFRG walls are used both architecturally and structurally as walls and slabs, with no columns and beams required. They have already found wide application, even without mature structural design codes, largely because of their environmental friendliness. In India, GFRG walls have been approved by the World Bank as being eligible for Carbon Credits under the Kyoto Protocol. GFRG panels are a composite material consisting of gypsum plaster and glass fibers. When the cavities are filled with reinforced concrete, the interaction between the concrete and the GFRG panels produces another composite. As a result, the structural behavior of GFRG walls and the associated building system are more complicated than that of conventional structural systems. This paper presents the results of extensive experimental and theoretical investigations into the structural behavior of GFRG walls, and offers a structural design methodology for GFRG walls and the associated building system.",

The obtained zinc-ion modified melamine polyphosphate (Zn-MPP) was used as an intumescent flame retardant in glass fiber reinforced polyamide 66 (PA66/GF). The effect of Zn-MPP on flame retardancy, thermal degradation and mechanical properties of intumescent flame retardant reinforced polyamide 66 system (PA66/GF/Zn-MPP) has been investigated. The results demonstrated that Zn-MPP is very effective in flame retardancy of PA66/GF. The limited oxygen index (LOI) value of PA66/GF/Zn-MPP reaches 39.2% when the Zn-MPP loading is 25 wt% in PA66/GF. It was also found that when the Zn-MPP loading is only 22 wt% in PA66/GF, the flame retardancy of PA66/GF/FR can still pass V-0 rating, and its LOI value also reaches 37.8%. TGA data obtained in pure nitrogen demonstrated that Zn-MPP has a good ability of char formation itself, and Zn-MPP shows a high initial temperature of the thermal degradation. It was found that Zn-MPP is comparatively stable in the range of processing temperatures of PA66 and is suitable for flame retarding glass fiber reinforced PA66. The PA66/GF/Zn-MPP (22%) has good properties with flame retardancy UL 94V-0 rating (1.6mm), tensile strength 129.4 MPa, flexural strength 185.0 MPa, and notched impact strength 7.0 kJ m(-2).",

          "abstract": "It is known that the buckling is characterized by a sudden failure of a structural member subjected to high compressive load. In this study, the buckling behavior of the aluminum tubular beam (ATB) was analyzed using finite element (FE) method, and the reinforcing arrangements as well as its combinations were decided for the composite beams based on the FE results. Buckling and bending behaviors of thin-walled ATBs with internal cast polyamide (PA6) and external glass and carbon fiber reinforcement polymers (GFRPs and CFRPs) were investigated systematically. Experimental studies showed that the 219% increase in buckling load and 661% in bending load were obtained with reinforcements. The use of plastics and metal together as a reinforced structure yields better mechanical performance properties such as high resistance to buckling and bending loads, dimensional stability and high energy absorption capacity, including weight reduction. While the thin-walled metallic component provides required strength and stiffness, the plastic component provides the support necessary to prevent premature buckling without adding significant weight to the structure. It is thought that the combination of these materials will offer a promising new focus of attention for designers seeking more appropriate composite beams with high buckling loads beside light weight. The developed plastic-metal hybrid-composite structure is promising especially for critical parts serving as a support member of vehicles for which light weight is a critical design consideration. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The validity of these in situ analyses was confirmed by X-ray micro-computed tomography (??CT) observations on tensile loaded specimens. Experimental results demonstrated that relative humidity (RH) conditions influence strongly the damage level and damage mechanisms. Indeed, for specimen with RH = 0%, damage initiation occurs at significantly higher load level than those in RH = 50% and RH = 100% specimens. The higher relative humidity condition also results in higher damage level. Damage chronologies have been proposed as damage initiation in the form of fiber-matrix debonding occurs at fiber ends and more generally at locations where fibers are close to each other due to the generation of local stress concentration (for all studied RH contents), and first fiber breakages occur (RH = 0%). These debonded zones further propagate through fiber-matrix interface (for all studied RH contents), and new fiber breakages develop (RH = 0%). At high relative flexural stress, matrix microcracks appear and grow regardless the RH contents. For RH = 100%, these microcracks are also accompanied by many matrix deformation bands. Subsequently, they lead to the damage accumulation and then to the final failure. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Hemp fiber is one of the inexpensive and readily available bast natural fibers and hemp-fiber reinforced polymer composite products have gained considerable attraction for automotive interior products. Though extensive research has been made on the performance evaluation of these composite materials, not much data is available on the moisture absorption of the composites, which restricts their use in exterior applications. This study aims to investigate the moisture absorption of short hemp fiber and hemp-glass hybrid reinforced thermoplastic composites to study their suitability in outdoor applications. The water absorption properties and its effect on the tensile properties of hemp and hemp/glass fiber hybrid polypropylene (PP) composites prepared by an injection molding process were investigated. Effect of hybridization on the water uptake and the kinetics of moisture absorption of the hemp fiber composites were evaluated by immersing the hybrid composite samples in distilled water at different temperatures, of 40, 60 and 80{degrees}C. The composites showed a Fickian mode of diffusion; however, a deviation was observed at higher temperature and may be attributed to the microcraks developed at the interface and dissolution of the lower molecular weight substances from the natural fibers. Equilibrium moisture content (Mm) showed that water up take of 40 wt% hemp fiber reinforced PP composites was highest and incorporation of glass fiber decreased the water uptake significantly (40%). Equilibrium moisture content was found to be independent of temperature, while diffusion coefficient (D) was increased with temperature. Effect of water absorption on the tensile properties of the composites showed that there is a significant reduction in strength and stiffness. It was observed that hybridization with glass fibers did not have any significant effect on the strength properties of the aged samples. The tensile properties of the re-dried aged samples showed an increased retention of strength properties after drying; however a complete recovery of the properties has not been achieved. This indicated that water absorption is not a physical process and permanent damage occurred to the composite after aging.",

          "abstract": "Graphite powder-based electrodes have the electrochemical performance of quasi-noble metal electrodes with intrinsic advantages related to the possibility of modification to enhance selectivity and their easily renewable surface, with no need for hazardous acids or bases for their cleaning. In contrast with commercial electrodes, for example screen-printed or sputtered-chip electrodes, graphite powder-based electrodes can also be fabricated in any laboratory with the form and characteristics desired. They are also readily modified with advanced materials, with relatively high reproducibility. All these characteristics make them a very interesting option for obtaining a large variety of electrodes to resolve different kinds of analytical problems. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art, advantages, and disadvantages of graphite powder-based electrodes in electrochemical analysis in the 21st century. It includes recent trends in carbon paste electrodes, devoting special attention to the use of emergent materials as new binders and to the development of other composite electrodes. The most recent advances in the use of graphite powder-modified sol-gel electrodes are also described. The development of sonogel-carbon electrodes and their use in electrochemical sensors and biosensors is included. These materials extend the possibilities of applications, especially for industrial technology-transfer purposes, and their development could affect not only electroanalytical green chemistry but other interesting areas also, for example catalysis and energy conversion and storage.",

Data for the fiber strength σc at the critical fiber length δc for five kinds of treated fibers are used for predicting UTS, which is obtained from both single fiber composite (SFC) and single fiber tension (SFT) tests, σc from SFC is attained using the Curtin theory on the fragmentation of SFC, while that from SFT is determined using a linear extrapolation of SFT data. Under good interface adhesion, the predicted UTS values based on the SFC data show the best agreement with measured ones at various fiber volume fractions, but a higher predicted value is obtained if the interface failure is matrix-controlled. For poor interfacial adhesion, the predicted UTS values are rather high compared to experimental ones due to the ineffective stress transfer. The predicted values based on the SFT data are much higher than the measured value for good interfacial adhesion.",

As a result of these requirements, the use of composite materials has increased during the past decades. In fact during the past five years, we have witnessed exponential growth in research and field demonstrations of fiber-reinforced composites in civil engineering. Manufacturers and designers have now access to a wide range of composite materials. However, they face great problems with forecasting the reliability of composites materials. Due to the differences among the properties of materials used for composites, manufacturing processes, load combinations, and types of environment, the prediction of reliability of composites is a very complex task. In this study, the reliability of fiber-reinforced composite laminate plates under random loads is investigated.

Resin blocks were bonded to maxillary first molars, and plaque accumulation on the resin block surface was examined after 8 hours. For the antibacterial test, the number of Streptococcus mutans in contact with the composite resin blocks after incubation for 12 hours was determined, and adherence of radiolabeled bacteria was evaluated. Less dental plaque was formed on Beautifil II resin block as compared to the other two materials. Antibacterial test revealed that there were no significant differences in the number of Streptococcus mutans among the three composite resins. However, the adherence of radiolabeled bacteria to the saliva-treated resin surface was significantly (p&lt;0.01) lower in Beautifil II than in the other two materials. These results suggested that Beautifil II could reduce dental plaque formation and bacterial adherence, leading to prevention of secondary caries.",

In addition, the total residual monomer content of FRC was quantitatively determined to find out the difference of the effectiveness of two types of light-curing units using liquid chromatography (HPLC). Unidirectional continuous E-glass FRC and hybrid particulate filler composite resins were used in the fabrication of test specimens. Four different positions of the FRC layer were used: compression, neutral, tension, and vertical side position. A three-point bending test (ISO 10477) was performed to measure the flexural properties of the specimens. Position of the FRC layer had a significant effect on the flexural strength (p&lt;0.001, ANOVA). Also, the type of light-curing device had an effect on flexural strength (p&lt;0.001). Specimens with FRC positioned on the compression side showed flexural strength of approximately 250 MPa, whereas FRC positioned on the tension side showed strength ranging from 500 to 600 MPa. Mean flexural modulus with FRC placed horizontally ranged between 9-12 GPa; no significant difference was found between these groups. However when fiber reinforcement was positioned vertically, the flexural modulus raised up to 16 GPa. Specimens with 24 vol% glass fibers contained 52% less residual monomer than specimens without glass fibers. The monomer content was lower in specimens polymerized with the curing device with higher polymerization temperature. In order to optimize flexural strength of low fiber volume fraction, the fibers should be placed at the tension side of the specimen.",

Consequently, hemisections, root amputations, and bisections are procedures frequently used. The prognosis of endodontically treated teeth depends on the type of reconstruction as well as the success of the endodontic treatment. Along with technological improvements in adhesive resins, cements, and composite restoratives, the evolution of fiber-reinforced posts enables the rehabilitation of endodontically treated teeth with greater esthetics and virtually no predisposition to root fracture. The purpose of this report was to describe the endodontic, surgical, and restorative treatments of a mandibular first molar with an endodontically and periodontally diseased mesial root, for functional, orthodontic, and aesthetic reasons. This case report shows that the clinical application of fiber-reinforced composite resins in hemisectioned teeth may be a treatment choice for highly damaged teeth with endodontic and/or periodontal lesions. It also emphasizes the advantages of the elimination of orthodontic and prosthetic treatment needs by different treatment strategies, especially in adolescent patients.",

          "abstract": "Background: Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have been used extensively in automotive and marine industries due to their lightweight high-strength properties. Meanwhile, Kenaf fiber reinforced polymer (KFRP) is commercially used in the natural fiber composite industries recently due to their low density, no health risk, high specific strength and modulus and renewability. However, the natural fiber has limitation in their strength and modulus, high moisture absorbtion and poor adhesion in fiber-matrix bonding. In this study, a new material based on carbon fiber, kenaf fiber and epoxy were developed and characterized which is known as carbon kenaf fiber reinforced polymer (CKFRP) composite. The fabrication of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) have been done by using filament winding and vacuum bagging system. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate tensile and compressive properties of the longitudinal (0° unidirectional) and transverse (90° unidirectional) of kenaf fiber and hybridization of the longitudinal and transverse kenaf fiber with plain weave carbon fiber. The specimens were tested using Instron universal tester machine according to ASTM D3039 standard for tensile test and ASTM D3410 standard for compression test. Results: It was found that the properties of hyrid CKFRP were improved by addition of carbon fiber. The hybridization of carbon fiber in 0° unidirectional enhances 136% compressive strength, 58% compressive modulus, 160% tensile strength and 65% tensile modulus. In 90° unidirectional, the properties of compressive strength, compressive modulus, tensile strength and tensile modulus increase up to 74%, 240%, 112% and 939%, respectively. Conclusion: Longitudinal kenaf fiber always gives good result in tensile properties due to tensile strength dependent on the fiber strength. Besides, the transverse fiber gives disadvantageous to tensile properties because the composite depends only on the shear properties of matrix.

          "abstract": "It is unclear how the amount of substance loss affects whether the fracture strength of endodontically treated and crowned teeth is increased by post placement. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of glass-fiber post placement on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated premolars with varying degrees of substance loss. Sixty-four extracted and endodontically treated mandibular premolars were divided into 4 test groups (n=16) depending on the number of residual coronal dentin walls that ranged from 3 to zero. Teeth in subgroups were either adhesively restored with composite resin without a post (-) or with an adhesively luted glass-fiber post (+). After receiving a 0.8-mm shoulder preparation, providing a ferrule of 0.5 mm, teeth were restored with complete metal crowns, which were cemented with glass ionomer cement. All specimens were subjected to dynamic loading in a masticatory simulator for 1.2 million loading cycles with a nominal load of 49 N at 1.2 Hz combined with thermal cycling (between 5 and 55??C, 30-second dwell time). Then specimens were quasi-statically loaded at 30 degrees in a universal testing machine until fracture. Data were analyzed with 2-way ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons using Tukey HSD test (??=.05). No specimen failed during masticatory simulation. Mean final fracture resistance ranged from 335.6 ??39.7 N to 1064.9 ??211.8 N. Two-way ANOVA revealed that both the number of residual coronal walls and post placement had a significant influence on the fracture resistance (P&lt;.001). However, pair-wise comparisons of groups showed that in groups with 2 or 3 cavity walls, the post effect was not statistically significant (P=.378 and P=.175, respectively). The fracture resistance of endodontically treated premolars was dependent on the number of residual coronal dentin walls. Placement of a glass-fiber post had a significant influence on the fracture resistance when fewer than 2 cavity walls remained but no significant influence when 2 or 3 walls were present. ?? 2011 The Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

A sparsely distributed idealized composite material, namely a glass fiber reinforced polyester (GFRP) was used as the workpiece. The analysis method employs a force sensor and the signals from the sensor are processed using either the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique or AR time series model. Signal distortion measure based on discrimination information is also introduced. The experimental correlations between the different chip formation mechanisms and power spectrum or AR model coefficients are then established. In particular, only those features that are most sensitive to different types of cutting mechanisms are selected by feature extraction method in AR modeling. Selected features are used to characterize the chip formation. Discrimination information measure proves to be useful in signal analysis when any characteristic of the cutting process is apparent in the form of spectral peaks. Effects of fiber orientation, cutting parameters and tool geometry on the cutting mechanisms and surface quality are also discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

This study employs several fiber orientation tensor closure approximations for both diffusion models and results are compared to those from the numerically exact spherical harmonic approach. Results are presented for variations in the fiber orientation and the processed part stiffness. A significant difference was observed between the stiffness predicted by both rotary diffusion models. It is worth noting that not all closures behave the same between the diffusion models, thus encouraging further studies to refine and validate the new fiber interaction models and solution approaches. A study of the predicted flexural modulus is presented, and results suggest that flexural modulus experiments may aid in further refining the fiber interaction models. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is produced for incorporation into the outermost position under the greatest tension in denture base resins. In this study, the flexural properties of self-, heat-, and light-curing reinforced resins were determined.\n\nMETHODS: The silanized glass cloth was soaked in urethanemethacrylate oligomer containing camphorquinone and 2-(dimethylamino)ethylmethacrylate. It was sandwiched between two pieces of polyethylene film and pressed to form a reinforcement sheet 0.3 mm in thickness, which was light-cured and prepared using four different surface conditions: with or without the polyethylene film and with or without a bonding agent. The reinforcement sheet was fixed in a fluorocarbon resin mold 3 mm in thickness, which was filled with self-, heat-, or light-curing resin and cured. The cured laminated plate was cut for flexural testing (40 x 7 x 3 mm3). A three-point flexural test was carried out at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min and a span length of 30 mm. In this study, the glass fiber content was measured at percentages by weight because it was not possible to determine accurately the volume of the various polymers.\n\nRESULTS: The baseline flexural strengths of the self-, heat-, and light-curing resins were 76.2, 68.6, and 55.6 MPa, respectively, and these values were increased to 271.7, 216.4, and 266.5 MPa by the reinforcement sheet. The baseline flexural moduli of self-, heat-, and light-curing resins were 2.0, 2.4, and 2.1 GPa, respectively. These values were increased to 7.2, 5.1, and 6.6 GPa by the reinforcement sheet. SEM photographs revealed good impregnation of the glass fiber within the polymer matrix.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: The differences in the flexural strengths and flexural moduli of the control and reinforced specimens were significant (p &lt; 0.01).",

Methods The water absorption, solubility, flexural strength, flexural modulus and toughness of different particulate filler composite resins were studied in vitro. Five different specimen groups were analyzed: A glass-free control, a non-silanized bioactive glass, a silanized bioactive glass, a non-silanized biostable glass and a silanized biostable glass groups. All of these five groups were further divided into sub-groups of dry and water-stored materials, both of them containing groups with 3 wt%, 6 wt%, 9 wt% or 12 wt% of glass particles (n = 8 per group). The silanization of the glass particles was carried out with 2% of gamma-3-methacryloxyproyltrimethoxysilane (MPS). For the water absorption and solubility tests, the test specimens were stored in water for 60 days, and the percentages of weight change were statistically analyzed. Flexural strength, flexural modulus and toughness values were tested with a three-point bending test and statistically analyzed. Results Higher solubility values were observed in non-silanized glass in proportion to the percentage of glass particles. Silanization, on the other hand, decreased the solubility values of both types of glass particles and polymer. While 12 wt% non-silanized bioactive glass specimens showed -0.98 wt% solubility, 12 wt% silanized biostable glass specimens were observed to have only -0.34 wt% solubility. The three-point bending results of the dry specimens showed that flexural strength, toughness and flexural modulus decreased in proportion to the increase of glass fillers. The control group presented the highest results (106.6 MPa for flexural strength, 335.7 kPA for toughness, 3.23 GPa for flexural modulus), whereas for flexural strength and toughness, 12 wt% of non-silanized biostable glass filler groups presented the lowest (70.3 MPa for flexural strength, 111.5 kPa for toughness). For flexural modulus on the other hand, 12 wt% of silanized biostable glass filler group gave the lowest results (2.57 GPa). Significance The silanization of glass fillers improved the properties of the glass as well as the properties of the composite. Silanization of bioactive glass may protect the glass from leaching at early stage of water storage.",

Prefabricated posts have been recommended with some debate as a method of restoring pulpless teeth before placement of the final restoration. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect on the strain, fracture resistance, and fracture mode of endodontically treated human incisors of 4 types of restorations with or without glass fiber posts after thermal cycling. Material and methods: Ninety human maxillary central incisors were selected and divided into 1 control group and 8 treatment groups (n=10). The teeth were endodontically treated and received 2 large Class III preparations simulating coronal destruction. The teeth were then restored with or without glass fiber posts and by using 4 restorative techniques: direct composite resin, direct composite veneer, feldspathic ceramic veneer, or a feldspathic ceramic crown. After artificial aging by thermal cycling, the incisors were loaded at a 135-degree angle, and the strain was measured by using strain gauges placed on the facial and proximal root surfaces. Specimens were subsequently loaded to the point of fracture. Strain and fracture resistance results were analyzed by a 1-way and 2-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey HSD and Dunnett tests (??=.05). Results: One-way analyses showed that the control group and the direct composite resin restoration with and without post groups presented significantly higher fracture resistance values (P&lt;.001). Two-way analyses showed no significant differences for the post system. Proximal strain values were higher in the control and composite resin groups and lower in the feldspathic ceramic groups. Conclusions: The presence of glass fiber posts did not increase the fracture resistance of endodontically treated incisors. Conservative composite resin restorations showed higher fracture resistance values. ?? 2012 The Editorial Council of the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.",

          "abstract": "The glass epoxy polymer composites are extensively used for a wide variety of applications in aerospace, automotive, and chemical industries due to an excellent property profile. Even though these composites are produced as near net shapes, the machining has to be performed in the final stage of production. Drilling is one of the most common machining processes used to install the fasteners for assembly of laminates. However, the drilling of these composites is rather a difficult task due to the highly abrasive nature of reinforcement and hence there is a need to study the machining performance. An attempt has been made in this article to investigate the effects of spindle speed and feed on machinability aspects, namely, thrust force, hole surface roughness, and specific cutting coefficient during drilling of glass epoxy composites. The drilling experiments were performed as per full factorial design for both glass epoxy composites and silicon carbide-filled glass epoxy composite materials. The response surface methodology based mathematical models were developed for analyzing the effects of cutting conditions on machinability characteristics. The parametric analysis reveals that the silicon carbide-filled glass epoxy composite material provides better machinability compared to glass epoxy composite without the addition of filler.",

One reason is that seawater effects degrade GFRP composites mechanical properties and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS).

This is to determine safety factors to use in the design of structural calculations for marine applications. Glass/epoxy composites are the safest materials to use in marine civil structures as mechanical properties degradation becomes stabilized after moisture saturation level.

In the present article, efficiency, accuracy, strengths and limitations of this method in predicting and discretely optimizing impact response of FRP composites have been studied through a case study on polypropylene/E-glass laminates with unidirectional, plain, and twill weave architectures. In parallel, drop weight impact tests, X-ray micro-tomography, and pre- and post-impact four-point flexural testing are employed for two purposes: (a) gaining further knowledge on induced impact damage mechanisms, and (b) further assessment and verification of the Taguchi results. In spite of the fact that impact events of the FRP laminates are highly nonlinear and accompany high level of uncertainty, it was found that this design of experiments method is capable of predicting and maximizing the absorbed impact energy with a reduced number of runs and reasonable error. Finally, by correlating macro-level predictions to micro-level damage observations via X-ray tomography, the underlying assumptions of the method were further scrutinized, and in particular it was found that the plies interaction effect is not a limiting factor in predicting the total absorbed energy of the laminates. Overall, the experimental time/cost saving in the performed impact optimization case study was over 50% using the Taguchi L9 orthogonal array.",

Experimental diffusion rate data are obtained from gravimetric analysis of T800/924 carbon fiber epoxy composites using Fickian absorption models adapted to account for hygro-elastic relaxation and polymer–penetrant interaction mechanisms. The transverse diffusion coefficient of the composite (Dz) is determined relative to that of the polymer matrix (Dp) and the ratio Dz/Dp is compared with experimental data provided in other published research. The experimental data, both from this investigation and that obtained from other sources, exhibit significant scatter and only limited correlation with a traditional flux-continuity model. The use of the adapted sorption models reduces experimental scatter by 60% through improved representation of the true sorption mechanics of polymer-based systems. The effects of fiber spatial distribution on the predictions of the flux-continuity model are also considered. There is found to be negligible difference between fully random and, the more commonly assumed and analyzed, regular-packed distributions. A novel finding of the investigation is an assessment of the effect layered high and low fiber volume fraction regions have on the transverse diffusivity of a composite. In such configurations, Dz/Dp is significantly reduced from that predicted using bulk composite properties, providing a possible explanation for the variation between some experimental data and predicted behavior.",

The primary objective of this paper is to provide a comparable radiographic analysis of different fiber reinforced polymer composites that are considered suitable for biomedical applications. Composite materials investigated consist of glass, aramid (Kevlar-29), and carbon reinforcement fibers, and epoxy and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) matrices.

          "abstract": "Results of experimental and modeling studies on the micromechanics of fiber pull-out are reported. For the experiment an optical glass fiber coated with a layer of acrylate or gold-palladium alloy is embedded in an epoxy matrix and then pulled out at various speeds. The fiber has a diameter of 125 or 200 ??m. While the fiber is pulled out, the coating is left embedded in the epoxy matrix, producing frictional sliding between the contact surfaces of the glass fiber and the coating. As the thin and long fiber is pulled out, the trace of pull-force versus displacement shows several distinct stages corresponding to different pull-out processes. In the debonding process of the glass-acrylate interface, stable crack growth was observed prior to unstable sliding. The stable crack growth behavior is believed mainly to be caused by the fact that the interface fracture toughness is strongly mode dependent and the mode mixity of the debonding crack varies towards tougher mode as the crack advances. After the interface is completely debonded, the trace of pull-force versus displacement shows stick-slip oscillations about a constant mean full force. Through the use of photoelasticity it is found that the unstable stick-slip sliding of the glass-acrylate interface is caused by the propagation of a highly concentrated active sliding zone, a dislocation, along the interface. When a thin gold-palladium coating is introduced at the interface to produce debonding and sliding along the glass-gold-palladium interface, the initial stable crack growth is not observed and the interface dislocation emission is suppressed. The interface fracture toughness and the frictional sliding resistance are found to depend on the thickness of the coating ; the interface fracture toughness is higher for thicker gold-palladium coatings, while the frictional sliding resistance is higher for thinner gold-palladium coatings. The sliding at the glass-gold-palladium interface also shows a stick-slip behavior under certain conditions. However, unlike the stick-slip process accompanying dislocation emission observed in the sliding process of glass-acrylate interface, the stick-slip is generated, while the entire contact interface slides simultaneously, by rate-dependent softening and hardening of the frictional interface. It is demonstrated that significant features of this type of stick-slip process can be predicted using a phenomenological friction law with an internal state variable.

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of different acids and etching times on the bond strength of glass fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) posts to composite core material.\n\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS: Twenty-six FRC posts (FRC Postec Plus) were randomly divided into 13 groups (each n = 2). One group received no surface treatment (control). The posts in the other groups were acid etched with 35% phosphoric acid and 5% and 9.6% hydrofluoric acid gel for four different etching times (30, 60, 120, and 180 seconds). A cylindric polytetrafluoroethylene mold was placed around the treated posts and filled with dual-cure composite core material (MultiCore Flow). All samples were light cured for 60 seconds. After 24 hours of water storage, the specimens were sectioned perpendicularly to the bonded interface under water cooling to obtain 2-mm post-and-core specimens. Eight specimens were made from each group. Push-out tests were performed at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min using a universal testing machine. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey honestly significant difference test (alpha = .05).\n\nRESULTS: The lowest bond strength was observed in the control group (12.51 megapascal [MPa]). No statistical significant difference was observed among group H5-120 (20.31 MPa), group H9-120 (20.55 MPa), or group P-180 (20.57 MPa) (P &gt; .05). These groups demonstrated the highest bond strength values (P &lt; .05).\n\nCONCLUSION: For the FRC posts, all acid-etching procedures tested showed significantly increased bond strength when compared with the control group. Acid-etching with 5% hydrofluoric acid and 9.6% hydrofluoric acid for 2 minutes and with 35% phosphoric acid for 3 minutes (groups H5-120, H9-120, and P-180, respectively) demonstrated the highest bond strength values between the FRC post and composite core material. Although the bond strength was increased by prolonged acid etching, the microstructure of the FRC posts might have been damaged.",

For comparison, the epoxy curing at the interface formed between the epoxy resin and (a) an uncoated glass fiber and (b) a polyorganosiloxane (obtained from the silane used for the glass-fiber coating) were also monitored. Chemically specific images of the OH and the H-N-H groups near the interface region were obtained. These images suggest that there is a chemical gradient in the structure of the matrix from the fiber surface to the polymer bulk due to different conversions. The basis of the different kinetics of the curing reactions is a result of amino group inactivation at the interface.

New refinements of the theory justify an earlier approximation of it for use with carbon/epoxy laminates and remove a degree of conservatism when the original theory is applied to glass-fiber-reinforced polymer composites. The intent is to compare the independent predictions for these same problems made by several originators of composite failure models and, simultaneously, to compare the predictions with test data. The chapter describes author&#039;s fiber-dominated theory. It is summarized because significant improvements are made while solving the problems posed by the organizers of the failure exercise. This refinement, distinguishing between the transverse strain in each lamina and that in the fibers, has confirmed the validity of the original formulation in which there is no distinction between these strains for carbon/epoxy laminates and shown that the difference does need to be accounted for with glass-fiber laminates. The author&#039;s assessment of the cracking of the matrix under transverse-tension loads is also explained.",

The addition of glass fiber-PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) laminas in graphite fiber-PPS composites was found to be effective in improving the impact resistance of the material. As the percentage of glass fibers increased, so did the maximum load tolerated and impact energies absorbed by the material. The intermixing of glass- and graphite-fiber plies also helped decrease the sudden catastrophic failure mode, which is usually associated with graphite-fiber composites. This was due to the extra strain energy dissipated by massive delamination and the subsequent crack blunting mechanism. Adding thermoplastic PPS-fiber laminas in epoxy/graphite fiber plies was also found to enhance the impact energy absorption capability of the otherwise brittle thermoset composites. Different extents of delamination and thickness-direction cracking were observed with different combinations of fibers and matrices.",

The entangled sandwich specimens have glass fiber cores and glass woven fabric as skin materials. The tested glass fiber entangled sandwich beams possess low compressive and shear modulus as compared to honeycomb and foam sandwich beams of the same specifications. Although the entangled sandwich beams are heavier than the honeycomb and foam sandwich beams, the vibration tests show that the entangled sandwich beams possess higher damping ratios and low vibratory levels as compared to honeycomb and foam sandwich beams, making them suitable for vibro-acoustic applications where structural strength is of secondary importance, e.g., internal paneling of a helicopter. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The posts were observed before and during the test by confocal microscopy. More voids were found within the Composipost radio-opaque than in other posts. Posts of all groups that were stored in water showed flexural strength values lower than posts that were stored dry. In all storage conditions, Carbotech posts showed higher flexural strength values than Composiposts and Snowposts, and Aestheti-Plus posts showed higher flexural strength values than Snowposts. Posts that were stored in bovine teeth showed flexural strength values similar to those of posts that were stored dry. It was concluded that fiber posts must not be in contact with oral fluids and that during the 1-yr storage in bovine teeth, they were sufficiently protected from this contact by the apical root canal filling and by the coronal composite resin filling.",

METHODS: By using various matrix materials and fibers, a number of fiber-reinforced composite formulations were evaluated with the goal of creating a system with optimized mechanical properties and handling characteristics. Fiber-reinforced composite based on a light polymerized BIS-GMA matrix has been used clinically to make 2-phase prostheses comprised of an internal glass fiber-reinforced composite substructure covered by a particulate composite. The clinical and laboratory procedures required for the fabrication and use of reinforced composite fixed prostheses are described for laboratory-fabricated complete or partial coverage fixed prosthesis and chairside prosthesis. RESULTS: Although additional clinical experience is needed, fiber-reinforced composite materials can be used to make metal-free prostheses with excellent esthetic qualities.",

The technical feasibility, elasticity, and strength of the reinforced plywood with short carbon fiber were evalu-ated. In a short fiber reinforcement system, the fiber length does not directly influence the reinforcement in Cox&#039;s theory when the fiber length exceeded a certain length. When the length of short carbon fiber is beyond 3 mm, the high reinforced result was obtained in the experiment. However, if fiber length was too long, the reinforced result was less owing to the bridge between fibers and the increase of holes. The optimum fiber length must be considered. The orientation of fibers has a strong influence on the rein-forcement. Unidirectional, perpendicular, and random ori-entation displayed different influence on the elasticity. Experimental results were discussed with Cox&#039;s method. Reinforced plywood with short carbon fibers in random orientation has a higher shear modulus and bending strength than the controls, in addition to other mechanical properties. have focused on fiber-reinforced wood composites. 1 5 Most of these pursuits have involved nonmetallic synthetic fiber-woven-cloth reinforcement, such as glass fiber, carbon cloth, and fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP). The fiber rein-forcement is beneficial for increasing the mechanical prop-erties of plywood, decreasing its variations, and improving its durability. Up to now, fewer investigations have been done on nonmetallic synthetic short fibers (discontinuous filament) in wood composite reinforcement. 4 The elasticity and strength of a material depend on the detail of its minute structure. The factors influencing elastic-ity and strength, such as fiber volume fraction, fiber orienta-tion, and compound structure, have been investigated in fiber-reinforced wood composites. 2&#039; 3&#039; 5 Because of the substi-tuted fiber cloth with short fibers in the reinforcement sys-tem, the other factors, such as fiber length and orientation of short fibers, must be considered. 6 In this study, the contri-butions of fiber length and orientation of fibers to elasticity in a short carbon fiber reinforcement system were investi-gated using Cox&#039;s theory and were demonstrated experi-mentally. From a practical point of view, technical feasibility, elasticity, and strength of reinforced plywood with short carbon fibers were evaluated.",

The present analysis has investigated this issue for short fiber case based on the well-known shear lag (the elastic stress transfer) theory. Using the relationships obtained, the minimum spacing between fibers is determined upon which the maximum fiber volume fraction can be calculated. The effects on the value of this maximum fiber volume fraction due to such factors as the mechanical properties of the fiber and matrix, the fiber aspect ratio, and fiber packing forms are discussed. Furthermore. Combined with the previous analysis on the minimum fiber volume fraction, this maximum fiber volume fraction is used to examine the property compatibility of fiber and matrix in forming a composite. This is deemed to be useful for composite design. Some examples are provided as well to illustrate the results.",

In this mini-review article, we provide an overview of recent progresses in developing transparent inorganic glass–ceramics phosphors excitable by blue chip, as an alternative to conventional polymer-based phosphor converter, for construction of high-power white light-emitting diodes. Two kinds of synthesis routes, glass crystallization and low-temperature co-sintering, are discussed in detail. Afterwards, the materials design, structure/property optimization as well as glass–ceramic-based WLED devices construction are summarized. Finally, challenges and future advances for the realization of transparent glass–ceramics in commercial applications will be presented.",

On the contrary, depending on the post design employed (tapered versus parallel-sided), the root can be weakened relative to the amount of tooth removed during preparation. In many cases, if there has been a high degree of damage to the clinical crown, conservative preparation for an anatomic tapered (biomimetic) post with the incorporation of a ferrule on solid tooth structure is necessary to protect the reaming root structure as well as for the long-term retention of the composite resin core and the definitive restoration. Adhesively luted endodontic posts reinforced with glass or quartz fiber lead to better homogeneous tension distribution when loaded than rigid metal or zirconium oxide ceramic posts. Fiber-reinforced posts also possess advantageous optical properties over metal or metal oxide post systems. The clinician should realize that there are admittedly substantial differences in the mechanical loading capacity of the different fiber-reinforced endodontic posts and should be aware of such differences in order to research and select a suitable post system for use.",

It is concluded that the correlation between spectroscopic investigations and mechanical properties of a FRP is indispensable.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone tissue response to fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) in comparison with titanium (Ti) implants after 12 weeks of implantation in cancellous bone using histomorphometric and ultrastructural analysis. Materials and methods. Thirty grit-blasted cylindrical FRC implants with BisGMA-TEGDMA polymer matrix were fabricated and divided into three groups: (1) 60 s light-cured FRC (FRC-L group), (2) 24 h polymerized FRC (FRC group), and (3) bioactive glass FRC (FRC-BAG group). Titanium implants were used as a control group. The surface analyses were performed with scanning electron microscopy and 3D SEM. The bone-implant contact (BIC) and bone area (BA) were determined using histomorphometry and SEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on Focused Ion Beam prepared samples of the intact bone-implant interface. Results. The FRC, FRC-BAG and Ti implants were integrated into host bone. In contrast, FRC-L implants had a consistent fibrous capsule around the circumference of the entire implant separating the implant from direct bone contact. The highest values of BIC were obtained with FRC-BAG (58 ?? 11%) and Ti implants (54 ?? 13%), followed by FRC implants (48 ?? 10%), but no significant differences in BIC or BA were observed (p = 0.07, p = 0.06, respectively). TEM images showed a direct contact between nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite of bone andboth FRC and FRC-BAG surfaces. Conclusion. Fiber-reinforced composite implants are capable of establishing a close bone contact comparable with the osseointegration of titanium implants having similar surface roughness.",

Thirty-nine specimens were fabricated and divided into 3 groups of equal size. All specimens were thermocycled for 5,000 cycles at 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C with dwell time of 30 seconds in each bath. Evaluation of shear bond strength was performed at a constant crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min according to ISO 10477.\n\nRESULTS: The mean values for the shear bond strength were 19.29 MPa for the control group (group A), 16.66 MPa for group B, and 16.74 MPa for group C. Despite a tendency to higher bond strength of group A specimens, no statistically significant difference was recorded between the groups (P &gt; .05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference was found between the metal and FRC substructures. Retentive rods on the FRO substructure do not seem to increase the bond strength significantly.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: It has been reported that complete caries removal from cavities during restoration of teeth is difficult. Furthermore with the tissue saving approach it is expected that more of the saved affected tissue will possibly harbor more residual bacteria. Antimicrobial restorative filling materials would be ideal to prevent the spread of caries after completion of tooth restoration, thus preventing recurrent decay and eventually restoration failure. This paper reviews the literature on the antimicrobial properties of dental restorative filling materials.\n\nMETHODS: Pubmed searches on the antibacterial properties of restorative materials were carried out. Keywords were chosen to assess antibacterial properties of conventional filling materials. Methods of introducing antimicrobial agents in restorative materials were also reviewed together with the methodology used to assess antimicrobial activity.\n\nRESULTS: 174 articles from 1983 till 2014 were included.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: Adhesive materials have decreased antimicrobial activity when compared to amalgams and zinc oxides. Several techniques have been employed in order to increase the antimicrobial activity of restorative materials. Although antimicrobial activity of restorative materials is important, the introduction of antimicrobial agents/techniques should not be at the expense of other material properties. Environmental changes within a material may affect the bacterial response to the antimicrobial. Bacterial adhesion to the restorative materials should be assessed. Long term assessment of antimicrobial activity is important and is clinically relevant. The use of antimicrobial dental materials is important unless such characteristics are gained to the detriment of other material properties.",

Another aim was to find out whether the curing mode affects the quantity of residual monomer and degree of conversion. Glass fibers were preimpregnated with a bioresorbable poly(hydroxyproline) amide and non-resorbable Bis-GMA-TEGDMA resin system. Specimens were immersed in water for 1, 3 or 7 days (37 °C) to determine the quantity of leached residual monomers, or in the solvent tetrahydrofuran for 3 days to determine the total quantity of residual monomers by high performance liquid chromatography. DC% was measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The quantity of residual monomer of the specimens decreased when the specimens contained glass fibers, and/or poly(hydroxyproline) amide, and/or when it was post-cured. The majority of the residual monomers were leached out during the first 24 h of immersion in water. The DC% of the specimens increased when post-cured. Also glass fibers in the composite increased the DC% in contrast to Bis-GMA-TEGDMA resin only. In conclusion, use of poly(hydroxyproline) amide as a sizing of the glass fibers in FRC does not increase the quantity of residual monomers. These results suggest that this new kind of partially bioresorbable FRC has potential for biomedical applications. © 2005 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "For meeting the requirements of lightweight and improved mechanical properties, composites could be tailor-made for specific applications if the adhesion strength which plays a key role for improved properties can be predicted. The relationship between wettability and adhesion strength has been discussed. The microstructure of interphases and adhesion strength can be significantly altered by different surface modifications of the reinforcing fibers, since the specific properties of the interphase result from nucleation, thermal and/or intrinsic stresses, sizing used, interdiffusion, and roughness. The experimental results could not confirm a simple and direct correlation between wettability and adhesion strength for different model systems. The main objective of the work was to identify the interphases for different fiber/polymer matrix systems. By using phase imaging and nanoindentation tests based on atomic force microscopy (AFM), a comparative study of the local mechanical property variation in the interphase of glass fiber reinforced epoxy resin (EP) and glass fiber reinforced polypropylene matrix (PP) composites was conducted. As model sizings for PP composites, gamma -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) and either polyurethane (PU) or polypropylene (PP) film former on glass fibers were investigated. The EP-matrix was combined with either unsized glass fibers or glass fibers treated with APS/PU sizing. It was found that phase imaging AFM was a highly useful tool for probing the interphase with much detailed information. Nanoindentation with sufficiently small indentation force was found to be sufficient for measuring actual interphase properties within a 100-nm region close to the fiber surface. Subsequently, it also indicated a different gradient in the modulus across the interphase region due to different sizings. The possibilities of controlling bond strength between fiber surface and polymer matrix are discussed in terms of elastic moduli of the interphases compared with surface stiffness of sized glass fibers, micromechanical results, and the mechanical properties of real composites.

In this model, steel and glass fibers are randomly dispersed across the cross section of the core while Twaron and carbon fibers are placed within the shell to improve the elastic modulus as well as to serve as a shield for protecting the glass fibers from alkaline attack; and the steel fibers from moisture and chloride induced corrosion. Glass composite reinforcement bars and hybrid composite reinforcement bars were fabricated by hand winding method. The tensile modulus and strength of the new hybrid reinforcement bars were determined to be 142 GPa and 628 MPa, respectively. New hybrid reinforcement bars were also conditioned in different alkaline environments and were evaluated for their alkaline resistance properties. Compared with glass composite reinforcement bars, the new hybrid composite reinforcement bars possess characteristics of alkaline resistance, good ductility and increased modulus of elasticity, while the material costs of such hybrid composite reinforcement bars are slightly higher than the glass composite reinforcement bars.",

In the present work, experimental modal analysis was conducted on the specimens previously subjected to fatigue loading to determine the modal parameters (natural frequency, damping ratio and mode shape). This was achieved through studying the response of modal testing with different specimens of different lamina orientations as a main factor affecting fatigue life. This correlates modal parameters such as: damping ratio, natural frequency and mode shape to fatigue behavior. The composite material used in experiments is glass fiber reinforced polyester (GFRP) laminate. Plane bending fatigue tests were performed on standard fatigue specimens. The fatigue test was interrupted at different fatigue life ratios (n/Nf) and modal testing was conducted to determine the change in modal parameters. The results showed that the changes of modal parameters provide a proper means for predicting the fatigue behavior of composite structures. From the experimental results of both dynamic and fatigue tests, curve fitting technique was used to correlate modal parameters to fatigue life. An exponential and quadratic equations have been obtained which correlate fatigue life ratio to damping ratio and resonant frequency respectively. It was noticed from the curves representing exponential and quadratic equations that the value of damping ratio ξ is more noticeable than the value of frequency, which means that the extent of fatigue damage determines the damping ratio, hence damping ratio could be said to be a good indicator of the fatigue life ratio.",

The glass fabric reinforced composite showed the steepest increase on the impact resistance with increasing laminate thickness. This behavior was attributed primarily to the higher areal coverage of the glass fabric used. The isotropic behavior of glass fibers in relation to the anisotropic character of aramid and carbon fibers was also of relevance. A quadratic equation was shown to provide a best fit to the experimental points, and the coefficient of the quadratic term was shown to reflect the increase of the impact resistance with laminate thickness. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Both carbon fiber and E-glass fiber composites were used with a vinyl ester resin. First, the single-step cured (i.e., co-cured) composite interface strength was compared to that of the two-step cured interface as used in the scarf joint technique. The results showed that the two-step cured interface was as strong as the co-cured interface. Carbon nanotubes were then applied to the composite interface using two-step curing, and then followed by Mode II fracture testing. The results indicated a significant improvement of the interface fracture toughness due to the dispersed carbon nanotube layer for both carbon fiber and E-glass fiber composites. The carbon nanotube layer was then evaluated as a means to monitor crack growth along the interface. Because carbon nanotubes have very high electrical conductivity, the electrical resistance was measured through the interface as a crack grew, thus disrupting the carbon nanotube network and increasing the resistance. The results showed a linear relationship between crack length and interface resistance for the carbon fiber composites, and allowed initial detection of failure in the E-glass fiber composites. This study demonstrated that the application of carbon nanotubes along a critical composite interface not only improves fracture properties but can also be used to detect and monitor interfacial damage.",

Materials and Methods: Inlay preparations for retaining FDPs were made in a polymer phantom model. Seventytwo FDPs with frameworks made of continuous unidirectional glass fibers (everStick C&amp;B) were fabricated. Three different pontic materials were used: glass ceramics, polymer denture teeth, and composite resin. The FDPs were divided into 3 categories based on the occlusal thicknesses of the pontics (2.5 mm, 3.2 mm, and 4.0 mm). The framework&#039;s vertical positioning varied respectively. Each pontic material category contained 3 groups (n = 8/group). In group 1, pontics were fabricated conventionally with composite resin (G-ӕnial, GC) with one additional transversal fiber reinforcement. In group 2, the pontics were polymer denture teeth (Heraeus- Kulzer). Group 3 had an IPS-Empress CAD pontic (Ivoclar Vivadent) milled using a Cerec CAD/CAM unit. Groups 1 and 2 served as controls. Each FDP was statically loaded from the pontic until initial fracture (IF) and final fracture (FF). Initial-fracture data were collected from the load-deflection graph. Results: ANOVA indicated statistically significant differences between the materials and occlusal thicknesses (p &lt; 0.001). Quadratic analysis demonstrated the highest correlation between the thickness of the pontic and IF and FF values with ceramic pontics (IF: p &lt; 0.001; R2 = 0.880; FF: p &lt; 0.001; R2 = 0.953). Conclusion: By increasing the occlusal thickness of the pontic, the load-bearing capacity of the FRC FDPs may be increased. The highest load-bearing capacity was obtained with 4.0 mm thickness in the ceramic pontic. However, with thinner pontics, polymer denture teeth and composite pontics resulted in higher load-bearing values.",

The tensile strength and elastic modulus increased, while the elongation at break decreased as the content of both short glass fiber and nanofiller increased.

Experimental values appear to be reasonably consistent with model predictions.

The main point of the design for LIPCA is to replace the heavy metal layers of THUNDER™ by lightweight fiber reinforced plastic layers without losing the capabilities for generating high force and large displacement. It is possible to save up to about 40% of the weight if we replace the metallic backing material by the light fiber composite layer. We can also have design flexibility by selecting the fiber direction and the size of prepreg layers. In addition to the lightweight advantage and design flexibility, the proposed device can be manufactured without adhesive layers when we use an epoxy resin prepreg system. Glass/epoxy prepregs, a ceramic wafer with electrode surfaces, and a carbon prepreg were simply stacked and cured at an elevated temperature (177 °C) after following an autoclave bagging process. We found that the manufactured composite laminate device had a sufficient curvature after being detached from a flat mould. An analysis method using the classical lamination theory is presented to predict the curvature of LIPCA after curing at an elevated temperature. The predicted curvatures are in quite good agreement with the experimental values. In order to investigate the merits of LIPCA, performance tests of both LIPCA and THUNDER™ have been conducted under the same boundary conditions. From the experimental actuation tests, it was observed that the developed actuator could generate larger actuation displacement than THUNDER™.",

Methods: Thirty-two glass methacrylate-based fiber posts (GC Corp.) were used in the study. Posts were divided into two groups, according to the surface pretreatment performed. Group 1: sandblasting (Rocatec-Pre, 3 M ESPE). Group 2: no pretreatment. In each of the two groups posts received three types of additional &quot;chair-side&quot; treatments. (1) Silane application (Monobond S, Ivoclar Vivadent); (2) adhesive application (Unifil Core self-etching bond, GC); (3) no treatment was performed. A dual-cured resin composite (Unifil Core, GC) was applied on the posts to produce cylindrical specimens. Specimens were cut to obtain microtensile sticks that were loaded in tension at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min until failure. The morphology of the post/composite interface and the post surface morphology were evaluated under SEM. Statistical analysis was performed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey test for post hoc comparisons (p &lt; 0.05). Results: Post surface pretreatment did not prove to be a significant factor in post-composite bond strength (p = 0.08), whereas &quot;chair-side&quot; treatment modalities and the interaction between pretreatment and treatment showed a significant influence on bond strength (p &lt; 0.001). When no &quot;chair-side&quot; treatment was performed, bond strength was significantly higher on sandblasted posts. Additional adhesive application resulted in significantly lower bond strength on sandblasted posts. When no pretreatment was performed, silane application resulted in higher bond strength than adhesive application. Conclusions: Sandblasting may give an increase in microtensile strength to methacrylate-based glass fiber posts, eliminating the need for additional &quot;chair-side&quot; treatments. Reducing the number of clinical steps could contribute to simplify the clinical procedures. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The surface of the bone was mechanically roughened and was either used as such, treated with dental primers (Unifil Bond Self-etching Primer, Clearfil Se Bond Primer), or treated with an experimental silane mixture (APS, ICS, MPS), or with a mixture of the experimental silane liquid and Clearfil Se Bond Primer. The 3M-ESPE Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Adhesive and UDMA/BisGMA/PMMA experimental adhesive gave poor results in the shear bond test (0.58 and 0.40 MPa, respectively). Unifil Bond Bonding Agent and Clearfil Se Bond adhesive with respective primers markedly improved the shear bond strength; with Unifil the result was 3.40 MPa, and with Clearfil it was 6.19 MPa. When the bone surface was primed with a mixture of Clearfil Se Bond Primer and Clearfil Porcelain Bond Activator, the Clearfil Se Bond adhesive-impregnated FRC veil gave the best adhesion to the bone surface in this test: 9.50 MPa. The addition of bioactive glass granules between the veil and the bone lowered the shear bond strength in the test system described above to 6.72 MPa. The test systems with the silane mixture were also promising. In the SEM study, it was found that the mechanical treatment reveals the pores of the bone surface. Chemical treatments of the bone surface improved the adhesion of the FRC veil to the bone. The results showed that the adhesion of the FRC to the surface of the bone can be significantly improved with mechanical roughening and with special chemical treatments of the bone surface.",

It has also been observed that increase in moisture content influences the mechanical properties unfavorably because water entering the fiber-matrix interface during swelling reduces the interaction.

          "abstract": "In recent years, it has been found that some concrete structures, even for some high performance concrete and ready mixed concrete under good quality control, start to deteriorate long before reaching their designed service life. Cracks are found after the structure has been completed for a few years, which results in the shortening of service life and lowering in durability. In this paper, the influence on the fracture properties of fiber reinforced polymer concrete, FRPC, subjected to freeze-thaw and thermal degradation, is discussed. The study on the damage influence was conducted using a climate chamber to perform the temperature changes on the single edge notched beams. FRPC specimens were subjected to freeze-thaw and higher temperature cycles and then tested according to RILEM standards. To determine the stress intensity factor, KIc, critical crack tip opening displacement CTODc, the Two Parameter Method was used and the fracture energy, Gf of the specimens was calculated to evaluate the fracture properties of FRPC. Three-point bending tests were carried out on notched beams with a clip gauge attached to measure the crack mouth opening displacement CMOD. Polymer concrete was reinforced with short glass and carbon fiber with 1% and 2% in mass respectively, to determine whether the reinforcement increases the performance of the material. The fracture properties of FRPC are reported in such conditions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Concentration tensors and effective constitutive equations are established on both scales and linked to establish the required coupling, thus providing the local fields throughout the composite as well as the global properties and effective nonlinear response. Two non-dimensional parameters, in conjunction with actual composite micrographs, are used to characterize the clustering of fibers in the composite. Based on the predicted local fields, initial yield and damage envelopes are generated for various clustering parameters for a polymer matrix composite with both carbon and glass fibers. Nonlinear epoxy matrix behavior is also considered, with results in the form of effective nonlinear response curves, with varying fiber clustering and for two sets of nonlinear matrix parameters.",

Displacement-controlled bending fatigue tests with R ratio of 0.10 were conducted on standard specimens and damage in the composite was continuously monitored through the loss of bending moment during cycling. The specimens were subjected to different fatigue loading, with the maximum load level up to 85% of the material ultimate flexural strength. Early damage was observed after a few hundred loading cycles causing degradation of material stiffness with cycling. The amount of stiffness reduction was observed to be a function of the magnitude of applied fatigue loading on the specimen. After 1 million cycles the fatigue test was stopped and residual properties were measured on tested specimens. Reduction in material strength and elastic modulus was found to depend on the level of fatigue loading. However, the reduction in stiffness did not exactly correlate with the reduction in strength. At last, possible use of the obtained data for the design of structural components is briefly addressed.",

Jute composite with unsaturated polyester resin as matrix showed the best results on flexural and tensile strengths and the lowest in impact energy, because of the strong interphase developed.

A new failure criterion that includes strain-rate effects was formulated and implemented to simulate different damage modes in unidirectional glass fiber/matrix composites. The laminate model uses Hashin&#039;s fiber failure criterion and a modified Tsai-Wu matrix failure criterion. The composite moduli are degraded using five damage variables, which are updated in the post-failure regime by means of a linear softening law governed by an energy release criterion. A key feature in the formulation is the distinction between fiber rupture and pull-out by introducing a modified fracture toughness, which varies from a fiber tensile toughness to a matrix tensile toughness as a function of the ratio of longitudinal normal stress to effective shear stress. The delamination between laminas is modeled by a strain-rate sensitive cohesive law. In the case of sandwich panels, core compaction is modeled by a crushable foam plasticity model with volumetric hardening and strain-rate sensitivity. These constitutive descriptions were used to predict deformation histories, fiber/matrix damage patterns, and inter-lamina delamination, for both monolithic and sandwich composite panels subjected to underwater blast. The numerical predictions were compared with experimental observations. We demonstrate that the new rate dependent composite damage model captures the spatial distribution and magnitude of damage significantly more accurately than previously developed models. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: The probability of failure under flexural load of veneered specimens of a unidirectional glass fiber-reinforced composite (FibreKor/Sculpture), a bidirectional glass fiber-reinforced composite (Vectris/Targis), a glass-infiltrated alumina (In-Ceram Alumina/Vita alpha), and a zirconia-reinforced glass-infiltrated alumina (In-Ceram Zirconia/Vita alpha) was investigated; a metal-ceramic (PG200/Vita omega) system served as a control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten uniform beams of the veneered core materials were fabricated for each system and subjected to a three-point bending test. The data were analyzed using the Weibull method. The failure load of specimens at a 10% probability of failure (B10 load) was compared. The mode of failure was analyzed. RESULTS: The B10 load of the systems investigated was not significantly different from that of the metal-ceramic system. FibreKor possessed significantly higher B10 load than Vectris, In-Ceram Alumina, and In-Ceram Zirconia. The B10 strength loads of Vectris, In-Ceram Alumina, and In-Ceram Zirconia were not significantly different from one another. CONCLUSION: The probability of FibreKor to fracture under a flexural load was significantly lower than that of Vectris, In-Ceram Alumina, or In-Ceram Zirconia.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and the osteoconductive capacity of bioactive fiber-reinforced composite implant (FRC) in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Threaded sand-blasted FRC implants and threaded FRC implants with bioactive glass (BAG) were fabricated for the study. Titanium implants were used as a reference. Eighteen implants (diameter 4.1 mm, length 10 mm) were implanted in the tibia of six pigs using the press-fit technique. The animals were sacrificed after 4 and 12 weeks. Histomorphometric and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analyses were performed to characterize BIC. RESULTS: In general, the highest values of BIC were measured in FRC-BAG implants, followed by FRC and Ti implants. At 4 weeks, the BIC was 33% for threaded FRC-BAG, 27% for FRC and 19% for Ti. At 12 weeks, BIC was 47% for threaded FRC-BAG, 40% for FRC and 42% for Ti. Four weeks after implantation, all the implants appeared biologically fixed by a newly formed woven bone arranged in the thin bone trabeculae filling the gap between the implant and the bone of the recipient site. Twelve weeks after implantation, the thickness of the woven bone trabeculae had increased, especially around the FRC-BAG implants. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the FRC implant is biocompatible in bone. The biological behavior of FRC was comparable to that of Ti after 4 and 12 weeks of implantation. Furthermore, the addition of BAG to the FRC implant increased peri-implant osteogenesis and bone maturation.",

That effort included epidemiological studies of workers, establishment of stringent workplace exposure limits, liaison with customers on safe use of products and, most importantly, a research program to evaluate the safety of existing glass fiber products and guide development of new even safer products. Chronic inhalation exposure bioassays were conducted with rodents and hamsters. Amosite and crocidolite asbestos produced respiratory tract cancers as did exposure to &quot; biopersistent&quot; synthetic vitreous fibers. &quot;less biopersistent&quot; glass fibers did not cause respiratory tract cancers. Corollary studies demonstrated the role of slow fiber dissolution rates and biopersistence in cancer induction. These results guided development of safer glass fiber products and have been used in Europe to regulate fibers and by IARC and NTP in classifying fibers. IARC concluded special purpose fibers and refractory ceramic fibers are &quot; possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot; and insulation glass wool, continuous glass filament, rock wool and slag wool are &quot; not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to human.&quot; The NTP&#039;s 12th report on carcinogens lists &quot; Certain Glass Wool Fibers (Inhalable)&quot; as &quot; reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.&quot; &quot; Certain&quot; in the descriptor refers to &quot; biopersistent&quot; glass fibers and excludes &quot; less biopersistent&quot; glass fibers. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..",

          "abstract": "This paper is a continuation of previous research reported in Ref. [1]. The previous paper discussed the relationship between fiber volume fraction in filament wound composite vessels and failure pressure. This research included a design of experiment investigation of manufacturing and design variables that affect composite vessel quality and strength. Statistical analysis of the data shows that composite vessel strength was affected by the manufacturing and design variables. In general, it was found that the laminate stacking sequence, winding tension, winding-tension gradient, winding time, and the interaction between winding-tension gradient and winding time significantly affected composite strength. The mechanism responsible for increases in composite strength was related to the strong correlation between fiber volume fraction in the composite and vessel strength. Cylinders with high-fiber volume in the hoop layers tended to deliver high-fiber strength. This paper further examines the relationship between fiber volume fraction and fiber strain to failure. Data from unidirectional strand tests and additional vessel tests are presented. A computer program that is based on the thermokinetics of the resin and processing conditions is used to calculate the fiber volume fraction distribution in the filament wound vessel. The strand&#039;s strength-versus-fiber volume data together with the computer program are used to predict composite vessel burst pressure. In general, good agreement with experimental data is observed. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the creep behavior and the viscoelastic properties of four commercial FRC posts under different temperatures and different storage conditions. Methods: The FRC posts tested were Glassix, C-Post, Carbonite and Snowlight. For the creep measurements a constant load below the proportional limit of the posts was applied and the angular deformation of the specimens was recorded. The viscoelastic parameters were determined by using dynamic torsional loading under four different conditions. Results: All materials were susceptible to creep and exhibited linear viscoelastic behavior. Residual strain was observed in all FRC posts. The viscoelastic properties were affected by the increase of temperature and water storage (p &lt; 0.001) resulting in their decline. Carbon fiber posts exhibited better performance than glass fiber posts. Conclusions: FRC posts exhibit permanent strains under regular masticatory stresses that can be generated in the oral cavity. Their properties are susceptible to changes in temperature, while direct contact with water also affects them deleteriously. ?? 2009 Japan Prosthodontic Society.",

          "abstract": "Polymeric matrices are viscoelastic materials and dissipate a part of the mechanical energy in the form of heat when they are submitted to a cyclic strain. During a fatigue test, the temperature of the material can increase and stabilize to some extent. Sometimes it increases until the sample fracture occurs which is called a thermal fracture. When the sample fracture is governed by crack initiation and propagation, it is called a mechanical fracture. The glass transition temperature of the PA66 matrix is not far from the ambient temperature and a temperature increase possibly induces a change of the matrix physical state. So the fatigue behaviour of our material strongly depends on temperature variations. The fatigue tests were carried out with an alternative bending device with a ratio R = -1, at 23 ??C, 45% RH and two different frequencies, 2 Hz or 10 Hz. The applied strain varies between 0.0116 and 0.0223. During the test, the surface temperature was measured in the most constrained part of the specimen by an infrared camcorder. For a 10 Hz frequency and although the test temperature is 23 ??C, the sample temperature at the surface is much higher and whatever the applied strain, the matrix is in a rubbery state at the material fracture. For a 2 Hz frequency, the PA66 matrix remains in the glassy state. The fatigue failure surface observed by scanning electron microscopy for both kinds of samples will be discussed. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of pretreatment (silanization) and thermocycling on bond strengths of 2 core materials to 3 different types of fiber posts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bond strengths of prefabricated glass (group 1), quartz (group 2), and individually formed glass fiber posts (group 3) to either a flowable or a highly viscous composite resin core material were measured using a push-out design. All posts were investigated with or without the application of a silane. Half of the specimens were stored in distilled water for 28 days, and were subsequently subjected to thermocycling (5000 cycles, 5 to 55 degrees C), whereas the other half was investigated after 24-h water storage. RESULTS: Bond strengths were significantly affected by thermocycling (p &lt; 0.0005), post type (p &lt; 0.0005), and pretreatment (p &lt; 0.0005), but not by the core material (p = 0.149; four-way ANOVA). Posts of group 3 demonstrated significantly higher bond strengths than all other posts, even after thermocycling (p &lt; 0.05; Tukey-B). CONCLUSION: While silanization had negligible effects, thermocycling drastically reduced bond strengths regardless of pretreatment, post type, or core material. The higher bond strengths between the group 3 posts and the flowable composite resin core material might result in improved stability of the core for postendodontic restorations.",

Type I collagen was used as a binding agent to combine the PLA fibers and the HA powder. Precipitate formation in Hanks&#039; balanced salt (HBS) solution was monitored to evaluate the in vitro apatite formation ability of the PLA-fiber/HA composite sheet. Precipitate formation was observed on the surface of the PLA-fiber/HA composite sheet after immersion in HBS solution for only 1 day, while no precipitate formation was observed on the PLA-fiber sheet without HA as a control. In conclusion, a PLA-fiber/HA composite sheet for use as a scaffold was successfully prepared. Within the limitations of this investigation, we confirmed that the PLA-fiber/HA composite sheet has a high apatite formation activity compared with the PLA-fiber sheet and represents a promising material for use as a scaffold.

The work described forms the first part of this evaluation program and concerns unidirectional carbon and glass fiber reinforced plastic subjected to static and dynamic torsional loading. The results and techniques will eventually be applied to complex composite structures. In the static torsion test program, &#039;good,&#039; void-free specimens failed at shear stresses of between 52 and 60 MN/m2 (carbon fiber) and between 56 and 62 MN/m2 (glass fiber) in a very brittle manner. The cracks thus generated led to substantial changes in the dynamic (vibration) test data. Specimens containing voids failed at lower shear stresses and less catastrophically. In torsional fatigue, all failures occurred by the propagation of resin-bound shear cracks at shear stresses below the static strength of the material. The dynamic (vibration) test parameters showed permanent and progressive changes due to the accumulation of fatigue damage. Crack development was observed visually in the glass fiber specimens and broadly related to the changes in the dynamic properties.",

Between these extremes are the widely studied chopped strand reinforced polyesters which are commonly used in automotive and other applications where fatigue resistance can be a key property. This chapter brings together the published data on each type of short fiber composite, along with treatment of continuous glass fiber composites. Much of the data has been fitted to relevant models to explore the general trends and bounds on fatigue sensitivity, and to attempt correlation with the dominant material variables such as fiber type, matrix fatigue behavior and interface quality. The mechanisms of wearout or crack advance are discussed and compared with static behavior where possible. Finally, prospects for the development of short fiber composites suitable for complex shapes, but approaching advanced composite fatigue resistance are considered.",

The measured storage moduli of the chopped fiber composites and of the hybrid composites and the storage and loss moduli of the continuous fiber composite generally fall within the bounds.

Methods: 77 patients (52 females, 25 males) received 96 indirectly made FRC FPDs, using pre-impregnated unidirectional glass-fibers, requiring manual wetting, as framework material. FPDs were surface (n = 31) inlay (n = 45) or hybrid (n = 20) retained and mainly located in the upper jaw. Hybrid FPDs consisted of a wing retainer at canine and an inlay retainer at distal abutment tooth. Surface FPDs consisted of uplay and wing combinations. Follow-up period was at minimum 4.5 years, with checkups at every 1-2 years. The study was carried out by six operators in three centers in the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. Survival rates, including reparable defects of FPDs, and success rates were determined. Results: Kaplan-Meier survival rate at 5 years was 71.2% (SE 4.8%) for success and 77.5% (SE 4.4%) for survival. Differences were not significantly different. Main failure modes were delamination and fracture of the FPD. Only FPDs with surface retainers showed debonding. Conclusions: A success rate of 71% and a survival rate of 78% after 5 years was found.

This paper discusses the influence of the forming pressure and coupler concentration on the mechanical behavior of glass fiber reinforced polypropylene composite laminates. The Design of Experiments’ (DOE) full factorial approach was adopted for conducting the composite laminate fabrication experiments. The thermoplastic composite laminates were fabricated in a hot compression molding machine, using the film stacking technique. This is an innovative approach to develop thermoplastic composite laminates, using the available low cost raw materials, instead of high end prepreg materials. As per the ASTM standard, the tensile and flexural tests were carried out, in order to evaluate the influence of the parameters on the mechanical behavior of the composite laminates. The Tensile and flexural strengths of the thermoplastic composite laminates were the responses measured to identify the most influencing parameter. The experimental results show that the increase in forming pressure and coupler concentration initially increases both the mechanical properties, and then decreases the properties of the composite laminates. Compared to the coupler concentration, the forming pressure greatly improves both the tensile and flexural properties. Using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), a morphological analysis was carried out to observe the bonding between the matrix and reinforcement.",

However, the application of GPEs is handicapped by their poor mechanical strength and high cost. Here, we report an economic gel-type composite membrane with high safety and good mechanical strength based on glass fiber mats, which are separator for lead-acid batteries. The gelled membrane exhibits high ionic conductivity (1.13 mS cm(-1)), high Li(+) ion transference number (0.56) and wide electrochemical window. Its electrochemical performance is evaluated by LiFePO4 cathode with good cycling.

Damage process of the samples is analyzed from cross-examining load–deflection curves and damaged specimens. From the visual inspection, for the impacted side of the samples, it is noted that the main damage modes for repaired samples are matrix and fiber cracks around point of impact and delaminations while severe matrix cracks expanded through fiber directions are the dominant damage mode for unrepaired samples. At the back surfaces, delaminations and fiber–matrix debonding oriented in the fiber directions are observed for unrepaired samples. However, for repaired samples the fiber fractures through repair line as well as the delaminations become dominant modes.

In this paper we report the results of an investigation aimed at understanding the effects of fabric architecture on impact resistance with the end goal of designing suitable architectures. The damage process is described through the application of a series of instructive plots called elastic energy curves, which present significant insight into materials behavior. It is shown that the results can be used in optimizing energy absorptivity through the use of appropriately designed architectures and hybrid systems.",

Combinations of post lengths of 6 mm (shorter than 1/1 clinical crown length), 9 mm (1/1 clinical crown length), and 12 mm (longer than 1/1 clinical crown length) made up 6 different groups consisting of 13 teeth each. The glass fiber posts (Snowpost) were cemented with Super-Bond C&amp;B and Panavia F luting cement. Composite-resin cores were made with Clearfil PhotoCore. The specimens were tested in a universal test machine. The testing machine applied controlled loads to the core, 2 mm from its incisal edge, on the palatal side at an angle 135 degrees to the long axis of the root. The testing machine was set at a crosshead speed of 5mm per minute. All samples were loaded until failure.\n\nRESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between cements (P&gt;.05). Posts shorter than clinical crown length, demonstrated root fracture under significantly lower loading forces (P&lt;.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: Usage of posts shorter than clinical crowns should be avoided to eliminate clinical failure.",

First, instrumented elementary specimens were tested under tension. FBG strain results were analyzed together with digital image correlation (DIC) measurements. The influence of the bonding layer on the measured strain and on the integrity of the sensor was investigated by considering different regions of interest. Next, an instrumented structural sandwich beam was tested under four-point bending. FBG rosettes were compared to conventional strain gauge rosettes. The high viscosity adhesive demonstrated behaviors that affected FBG accuracy. Brittleness of the bonding layer and poor interface adhesion were observed using DIC and X-ray tomography. By contrast, the low viscosity adhesive demonstrated satisfactory results. The FBG strain measurements appeared to be consistent with those of DIC. The accuracy is also adequate as the FBGs and the conventional strain gauges had similar results in three directions, under tension and under compression.",

The analytical predictions are compared to the experimental stiffness values from tensile tests on the composite material showing a good agreement. The FLD in terms of the probability density distribution as function of the fiber aspect ratio has been computed by an automated fiber separation and image analysis tool. On the other hand, the FOD in terms of the probability density distribution as function of fiber in-plane orientation was identified by using an image correlation procedure based on computer tomography scans of characteristic LFT specimens. Our analysis shows a good performance to predict Young&#039;s modulus of LFT due to incorporation of the FOD as well as the FLD into the calculations. ?? 2013.",

Continuous unidirectional E-glass fibers were preimpregnated with a novel biopolymer of poly(hydroxyproline)amide and ester. The preimpregnated fibers were then further impregnated in a co-monomer system of Bis-GMA-TEGDMA, which formed semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPN) with the preimpregnated polymer. After light initiated polymerization of the monomer system, rectangular shaped bar specimens (N=4) were tested by the three-point bending test. The control material was a fiber-reinforced composite with a Bis-GMA-TEDGMA-matrix only. The mean flexural strength of poly(hydroxyproline) amide preimpregnated fiber composite was higher than that of the control (FS=888 vs. 805 MPa). The poly (hydroxyproline) ester preimpregnated fibers resulted in lower strength (FS=541 MPa). The results of this study suggest that preimpregnation of glass fibers with poly(hydroxyproline) amide and the use of such fibers in fiber-reinforced composites with IPN polymer matrices, can reach relatively high mechanical properties.

An explanation is given for the increase in maximum transmission which occurred for composites containing annealed glass fibers.

          "abstract": "Endodontically treated teeth are traditionally restored with a crown to prevent fracture. The aim of this study was to compare the fracture resistance and failure modes of endodontically treated maxillary premolars treated with or without a fiber post and restored with different types of crowns. Eighty human maxillary premolars were selected. After root canal treatment, the teeth were embedded in resin blocks and divided into four groups. Samples received MOD cavity preparations and were divided into two subgroups: with and without fiber posts and restored using porcelain fused to metal, lithium disilicate, fiber-reinforced composite, or zirconia crowns. The specimens were vertically loaded in the central fossa using a universal loading machine until failure, and the maximum breaking loads were recorded. Samples were perfused with Indian ink to highlight the fracture lines and the mode of failure that was classified as restorable or nonrestorable. Even without post, all crown designs resisted vertically applied forces beyond those that may be encountered in the mouth. Two-way analysis of variance revealed the use of a fiber post (p = 0.007) and the type of crown (p &lt; 0.001) significantly affected the restorability of fractured teeth. The relationship between placing or not placing the post and the type of failure (restorable/nonrestorable) was found to be significant (??2 test, p = 0.002). Although post placement resulted in higher fracture resistance values, these were significant for Empress II crowns only. The results suggest that the posts could contribute to the reinforcement and strengthening of pulpless maxillary premolars. With respect to failure modes, placement of fiber posts improved the fracture from nonrestorable to restorable patterns. This study suggests that the placement of fiber posts is necessary to improve fracture resistance even under full-coverage crowns. ?? 2007 American Association of Endodontists.",

          "abstract": "Compressive mechanical behaviour and failure modes of E (electrical)-glass/polyester composite laminates tailored with a thermoplastic preforming polyester binder were investigated under ply-lay up and in-plane loading directions. Fiber preforms with various amount of the binder were consolidated under heat and pressure. The preform compaction experiments were performed by applying compressive pressure to the preforms, and the average thickness as a function of pressure was measured. It was found that the highest compaction of the preforms and therefore the highest fiber volume fraction can be obtained with 3 wt.% of the binder. Further increase of the amount of binder decreases the degree of compaction. Composite panels were fabricated by vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding using fabric preforms with various binder concentrations. The present investigation reveals that there are considerable effects of the binder on the compressive mechanical behaviour of the composites. Compression testing of the composites showed that the average strength values are in the range of 400-600 and 150-300 MPa for ply-lay up and in-plane directions, respectively. Also, both the strength and modulus values increase up to 3 wt.% of the binder, and these values decrease with further addition of the binder. Scanning electron microscopy showed that failure modes of the composites are altered significantly by the presence of the binder. Furthermore, the interaction between the binder and the reacting resin was followed to determine the extent of the binder dissolution and its effects on the viscosity of the resin and the mechanical behaviour of the matrix polymer. The results indicate that there is a partial dissolution of the binder within the matrix resin. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Nylon 66, an aliphatic semicrystalline polyamide, was reinforced with E-glass fibers or high-modulus (AS4) carbon fibers. As in many reinforced semicrystalline thermoplastics, an interphase composed of transcrystallinity developed owing to the high nucleation density of the polymer on the fiber surface. The influence of this region on the fiber–matrix adhesion was studied with a modified microdebond test. E-glass fibers were freshly prepared in our laboratory by traditional glass-forming techniques and embedded in a film of Nylon 66 or a Nylon 66/ poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) blend. Previous work has shown that PVP, an amorphous polar polyamide, has a dramatic influence on the morphology of Nylon 66. This phenomenon was utilized to manipulate the interphase formation in the Nylon 66 composite from one having a complete transcrystalline interphase to a composite with the absence of an interphase. PVP was introduced to the matrix by solution blending with Nylon 66 and/or to the fibers as a sizing prior to embedment. The resulting morphologies were studied by polarized hot-stage optical microscopy. From the microdebond and morphology results, it was shown that the fiber–matrix adhesion in this composite system is dependent upon interphase microstructure. Composites containing transcrystallinity have higher interfacial shear strength values than those that do not contain this interphase. This has profound implications for the bulk mechanical properties of the composite, which are addressed in Part 2 of this paper. q1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Oil-water separation is a major problem in industries such as oil production and wastewater treatment, where millions of gallons of oil-contaminated water are produced. Zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA) is a superhydrophilic polymer due to its strong interaction with water via electrostatic interactions. By coating surfaces of filter media with such a superhydrophilic polymer, it is expected that one can effectively separate oil and water. In this work, pSBMA was grafted onto glass fiber surfaces using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). The in-air water contact angle of the pSBMA-treated glass was 8-15°, as compared to 31° for the control untreated glass, whereas the underwater-oil contact angle of the pSBMA-grafted glass was 162-169°, as compared to 142° for the control pristine glass, suggesting that the pSBMA-grafted glass slides are superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic. Such superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity were realized by modifying surface chemistry only, with no need to create rough surfaces. The pSBMA-grafted glass fiber filters demonstrated exceptional results at separating oil from water without even allowing miniscule amounts of visible oil to permeate through.",

Four types of loads simulating normal mastication were selected. The stress within models was calculated, and output by means of graph and data. RESULTS: There was stress concentration around connectors and retainers near connectors under cusp -fossa load, occlusal even load, and lateral load. When dentures were reinforced with fiber framework, area of stress concentration and principal stress max could decrease in comparison with pure composite resin bonded fixed partial denture. Under buccal-lingual load, there was another stress concentration around central fossa beside above two stress concentration areas. Only modified fiber framework constructed with both mesial-distal and lingual-buccal directional glass fiber could markedly reduce principal stress under buccal-lingual cusp loads. CONCLUSION: Under 4 types of loads simulating normal mastication, three critical regions were disclosed at the area of retainers adjacent connectors, connectors and occlusal central fossa and fissures. Only modified fiber framework constructed with both mesial-distal and lingual-buccal directional glass fiber could markedly reduce stress concentration under buccal-lingual cusp loads.",

The non-crimp 3D woven fabric composite, loaded in both principal in-plane directions (warp and fill), shows the best quasi-static tensile properties and, when loaded in the fill direction, exhibits much longer fatigue life than its laminated plain weave counterpart. During both quasi-static and fatigue loading, the latest damage initiation is observed for the 3D woven composite in both in-plane directions. The PW laminate develops delamination between the plies for each maximum stress in the cycle considered. Contrary to that, the 3D composite is not affected by delamination neither under quasi-static nor under fatigue loading conditions. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

By using various matrix materials and fibers, a number of fiber-reinforced composite formulations were evaluated with the goal of creating a system with optimized mechanical properties and handling characteristics. Fiber-reinforced composite based on a light-polymerized BIS-GMA matrix has been used clinically to make 2-phase prostheses comprised of an internal glass fiber-reinforced composite substructure covered by a particulate composite. The clinical and laboratory procedures required for the fabrication and use of reinforced composite fixed prostheses are described for laboratory-fabricated complete or partial coverage fixed prosthesis and chairside prosthesis.

The study applies injection foam molding technology using a physical blowing agent to a wood-fiber/HDPE composite, and examines the effects of the processing parameters on the dimensional and mechanical properties and cell density of the composite foams. In addition, the physical properties and cost of wood-fiber/HDPE composite foams are compared with those of solid HDPE. The experimental results show that wood-fiber/HDPE composite foams that have a 20% weight reduction have superior physical properties, such as density, dimensional properties (68% decrease of shrinkage and 91% decrease of warpage) and mechanical properties (28% increase of Young&#039;s modulus). Furthermore, the cost analysis confirms that wood-fiber/HDPE composite foams are much less expensive (by 40%) than HDPE. Therefore, it is concluded that wood-fiber/HDPE composite foams are strong candidates for replacing current injection-molded HDPE products. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",

Membranes with different structures (ideally porous, dense and composite) and from different materials (polyetilentereftalate, polyamide and polyamide/polysulfone) have been considered. Measurements were made with the membranes in contact with NaCl solutions at different concentrations (10-3≤c(M)≤5×l0-2). Membrane electrical parameters (resistance and capacitance) were determined from impedance plots by using equivalent circuits as models. Differences in the equivalent circuits obtained for the studied membranes are related to the different membrane structure. The uniform capillary model was assumed for the ideal porous membrane and good agreement was obtained when experimental and calculated electrical resistance values are compared. This point indicates that electrical measurements could also be used for geometrical characterisation of this kind of membranes. For dense membranes, capacitance values allow the estimation of structural or material characteristic parameters, while for composite membranes EIS measurements allow the characterisation of each sublayer.",

The filters are particularly useful for chemical analyses of the filter-retained particles, because of the physico-chemical stability of the material the filters are made of. Despite this usefulness, very small particles, e.g. many planktonic bacteria, are known to pass the glass fiber filters, and little information is currently available on the fraction passing the filters. In this study, natural bacterioplankton cells were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters, and apparent cell size-frequency distributions were obtained by epifluorescence photomicrography before and after the filtration. Seawater samples were from a northwest Atlantic coast and an Antarctic sea. Filtrate contained 35 to 43% of the total bacterial cell count, equivalent to 22 to 38% of the total bacterial biomass. Size-frequency distributions showed that cells larger than 0.8 mu m diameter (volume-equivalent spherical diameter, VESD) did not pass the filters, however the filters retained substantial numbers of small (VESD &lt; 0.8 mu m) bacteria. In comparisons of the different types of glass fiber filters, retention efficiency (fraction of the cells retained by a filter) ranged from ca 13 to 51%, i.e. 49 to 87% of the natural bacterioplankton cells passed through the tested filters. Interpretations of data obtained via filtrations through glass fiber filters must properly consider the fraction not retained by the filters.",

In both sets, a pin to plane configuration is used to grow electrical trees around the barrier area. Several patterns of tree propagation are investigated. Due to the effect of barrier to hinder the growth, tree shape and growth rate are influenced at both sides of the barrier. The structure of barrier and its adhesion to the surrounding resin are the main factors to be considered for selection of the barrier to prolong the lifetime of composite. Horizontal growth relationship with penetration delay is studied. This delay is aggravated by the lack of energy of horizontally grown leading branches. A mechanism, explaining the delay of a leading branch to penetrate the barrier, is introduced. The mechanical stresses determined by de-bonding, deformation and carbonization in the interfacial area are studied. Finally, the results of this work are very important for breakdown analysis, life assessment and improvement of composite insulation and power cables.",

          "abstract": "The use of polymer–matrix composites in structural applications necessitates certain degree of machining operations to meet the final product integrity. Drilling is an essential machining operation being used in composite industries for making of holes for bolted joints. The conventional drilling, which is frequently used for making holes in polymer–matrix composite parts, is not convenient anymore because of plethora of challenges encountered. The major drawback is the drilling-induced damage, which mainly occurs due to the direct interaction between the tool and composite laminate. Therefore, there exists a research opportunity to develop cost-effective high-quality machining methods for composite laminates. In the present research endeavor, rotary-mode ultrasonic drilling process has been conceptualized and developed for the drilling of fiber-reinforced polymer composites. The influence of various process parameters including power rating, slurry concentration, and abrasive size on material-removal rate, tool wear rate, and average surface roughness (Ra) has been experimentally investigated. It has been observed that the entry and exit delamination is prevented, and hole circumferential edge quality is improved when holes are produced through rotary-mode ultrasonic drilling as compared to the conventional drilling. It has also been found that with substantial modification in the conventional ultrasonic drilling process, the drilling performance in terms of material-removal rate of glass-epoxy laminates can be significantly improved. The major contribution of the present research endeavor is the development of a novel method of making clean-cut damage-free holes in fiber-reinforced composite laminates.",

          "abstract": "At early ages (less than 24 h), cracking can occur in concrete because it can be subjected to dimensional changes, due to shrinkage, can generate loads which are greater than the low strength capacity of the material at this age. This is especially the case in members with highly exposed surfaces, such as floor slabs or precast panels. As any other cement based composite, Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) shrinks at an early age and can crack when shrinkage is restrained. One possible solution to reduce the impact of early age shrinkage on concrete durability is to include low volumetric fractions of short fibers in order to control crack growth. To evaluate the cracking control ability of Alkali Resistant (AR) glass fibers in standard concrete and SCC, an experimental program, developed in accordance with the AR-glass fiber producer, was conducted. Two different types of AR-glass dispersible fibers, two concrete compositions and several volumetric fractions of fiber have been studied. The experimental program included a mechanical characterization of the different concrete compositions (compression and flexural strength tests), free shrinkage tests, with and without air flow over the samples, and double restrained slab cracking tests (Kraai slab modified test). The results obtained show that the inclusion of low volumetric fractions of the two types of AR-glass fiber under study can control the cracking produced due to very early age shrinkage on both standard concrete and SCC in two different ways: reducing the total cracked area and the maximum length of the cracks. Although, a non-linear dependence of cracked area on AR-glass fiber amount was found. A microscopic study of the cracked surface confirms the favorable effect of the presence of dispersed AR-glass fibers on cracking control. When standard concrete and SCC results were compared, it was observed that, although SCC drying shrinkage was larger, standard concrete with a similar performance in the hardened state produced equivalent cracking area. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Four kinds of materials were used: soda-lime glass plates, unidirectional glass-fiber/epoxy layer (one ply, two plies) coated glass plates, crossed glass-fiber/epoxy layer (only two plies) coated glass plates. The maximum stress and absorbed fracture energy of these plates were measured by a single-grid strain gage bonded to the back surface of the glass plates during the impact of the steel ball. With increasing impact velocity, various surface cracks, such as ring, cone, radial and lateral cracks, occurred near the impact sites of the uncoated glass plates. Plates with glass-fiber coating had a plastic deformation zone between the fiber layer and the glass plate that formed around the impact site while the surface cracks in the plates drastically diminished. The principal direction of this plastic deformation and delamination followed the fiber orientation. The impact surface-fracture index expressed in terms of the maximum stress and the absorbed energy could be used as an effective evaluation parameter for surface resistance. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Each group contained 10 specimens: Group 1, resin without post; Group 2, resin with carbon fiber post; Group 3, resin with glass fiber post. The samples were immersed in water at 37 degrees C until the three-point loading test was performed at a speed of 1.0 mm/minute. The results were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey&#039;s test (P = 0.05). Both fiber posts were similar in strength and both were stronger than the control. Group 3 obtained a higher mean modulus of elasticity than Groups 1 and 2, which were similar. The results of this study demonstrated that the presence of a fiber post significantly raised flexural strength values and the glass fiber post significantly increased the modulus of elasticity of the evaluated composite resin.",

Carbon fiber/epoxy composites with fiber volume fractions of 12, 17, 38 and 61 vol% were subjected to flexural deformation on a Dupont DMA 983 instrument. The dependencies of dynamic mechanical properties of the composites on experimental parameters such as oscillation mode, amplitude, frequency, and temperature were investigated. As opposed to the storage modulus, the loss modulus is found to be sensitive to all parameters. In a fixed multiple frequency mode, the loss modulus of the compos- ites increases with oscillation amplitude and decreases with frequency and the number of tests. The information produced in the resonant mode is more repro- ducible. An additional damping at the interfaces, apart from those of the con- stituents, suggests a poor interface adhesion in these composites. A linear rela- tionship between the excess damping at the interfaces and the fiber volume fraction shows a similar interface quality for these composites having different fiber volume fractions. The detection of interfacial properities was found to be more sensitive in the flexural deformation mode than in the torsional mode. At temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature of the matrix, the effective volume fraction of the matrix is reduced. Such a reduction can be interpreted from the mismatch of thermal expansion of the matrix and the fibers.",

The model is based on the assumption that shear stress is produced between fiber and surrounding matrix as the matrix deforms. This shear stress in turn influences the matrix creep behavior resulting in macroscopic creep strain lower than that of pure cement-based matrix. In the present paper, a creep strain expression in the form of matrix creep strain multiplying by a fiber influence factor, which reflects the influences of matrix and fiber properties as well as fiber orientation characteristics, is presented. A parametric study, including the influence of elastic moduli of fiber and matrix, fiber dimension and fiber content is carried out. The modeling results indicate that creep strain of fiber reinforced cement-based composite is significantly influenced by the elastic moduli of fiber and matrix as well as fiber length and thickness (i.e. diameter for fiber with circular cross-section). Model predictions compare favorably with experimental measurements of creep strain of fiber reinforced mortar and concrete under compressive load. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Tensile strength of the CIM parts steadily increases with the increase of the GF content. For neat iPP molded by GAIM, as the gas pressure increases the tensile strength increases. However, for the iPP/GF composites, the tensile strength generally decreases when the gas pressure increases. And, at a given content of GF, tensile strength of the parts molded by GAIM is unexpectedly lower than that of the counterparts molded by CIM. At a given gas pressure, the higher the fiber content, the lower the tensile strength. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) results show that foaming structure should be responsible for the poor tensile strength of the composites molded by GAIM. The poor adhesion between the glass fibers and the matrix and the unique properties of the gas used in GAIM process are the substantial factors in the formation of foaming structure.",

          "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of directly fabricated glass and polyethylene resin-bonded fiberreinforced composite (FRC) inlay-retained fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) in posterior single missing teeth over a short period of time.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen inlay-retained FRC FDPs with tub-shaped or box-shaped retainers were directly constructed in patients of both genders. A baseline examination was performed and the patients were examined regularly at 6-month intervals. The sulcus bleeding index, Silness-Löe plaque index, and probing depths of the abutments were checked regularly. Modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) parameters were used to compare the restorations at baseline and final examination. The Kaplan-Meier survival estimation method was performed to detect the overall survival rates and mean survival times of the restorations at the end of the follow-up.\n\nRESULTS: The length of the clinical observation was between 16 and 40 months for the FDPs still functioning after the end of the follow-up. No partial or total debonding of the prostheses or fracture of the frameworks was detected. Four veneering composite fractures at the veneer layer/fiber framework interface occurred in the pontic elements of 2 glass FRC FDPs and 2 polyethylene FRC FDPs after 6 and 10 months, and 20 and 22 months, respectively. Periodontal evaluation revealed clinically acceptable results, as did the USPHS evaluation. The overall survival curves of Kaplan-Meier at the end of the follow-up illustrated a 71% survival rate for the both glass and polyethylene FRC FDPs with mean survival times of 27 and 35 months, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study reported a mean period of service of 19 and 31 months for directly fabricated inlayretained glass and polyethylene FRC FDPs, respectively, with a 71% survival rate for the two framework constructions. Within the limitations of the study, these results can only be considered as preliminary. However, because of the lack of clinical data available for directly fabricated inlay-retained FRC FDPs, the results of this clinical observation may contribute to the still-evolving clinical knowledge of the FRC restorations.",

          "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of air drying temperature and different silane coupling agents on the bond strength between glass fiber posts and composite resin core. The post surface was cleaned with alcohol and treated with different silane coupling agents, being three prehydrolyzed silanes [Silano (Angelus), Prosil (FGM), RelyX Ceramic Primer (3M ESPE)] and one two-component silane [Silane Coupling Agent (Dentsply)]. Two post-silanization air drying temperatures, 23ºC and 60ºC, were applied. A cylindrical plastic matrix was placed around the silanized post and filled with composite resin. Each bonded post provided 7 slices for push-out testing. Each slice was loaded to failure under compression at a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Scott-Knott tests (α=0.05). Dunnett&#039;s test was used to compare the mean of the control group with that of each experimental group. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the interface of the fractured slices. For the 23ºC air drying temperature, the use of RelyX Ceramic Primer resulted in significantly lower bond strength than the other silane coupling agents, while the bond strength with Silane Coupling Agent was the highest of all groups. Only with Silane Coupling Agent, the bond strength for the 23ºC air drying temperature was significantly higher than that for 60ºC air drying. In conclusion, the use of warm air drying after silane application produced no increase in the bond strength between the fiber-reinforced composite post and the composite core. The two-component silane produced higher bond strength than all prehydrolyzed silanes when it was used with air drying at room temperature.",

Polished. thin sections removed from plain glass fiber/nylon composites and their corresponding fiber-metal laminates indicated that the prevailing microstructure was strongly. dependent on the rate of cooling from the melt. Mode I and Mode 11 interlaminar fracture tests on the plain glass fiber reinforced nylon laminates indicated that the values of G(Ic) and G(IIc) averaged approximately 1100 J/m(2) and 3700 J/m(2) respectively at all cooling rates. The degree of adhesion between the aluminum alloy and composite substrates was investigated using the single cantilever beam geometry. Here, the measured values of G, were. similar in magnitude to the Mode I interlaminar fracture energy of the composite, tending to increase slightly with increasing cooling rate. The tensile and flexural fracture properties of the plain composites and the fiber metal laminates were found to increase by between 10% and 20% as the cooling rate was increased by two orders of magnitude. This effect was attributed to over-aging of the aluminum alloy plies at elevated temperature during cooling. Finally, fiber metal laminates based on glass fiber/nylon composites were shown to exhibit an excellent resistance to low velocity impact loading. Damage, in the form of delamination, fiber fracture, matrix cracking in the composite plies, and plastic deformation and fracture in the aluminum layers, was observed under localized impact loading. Here, the fast-cooled fiber metal laminates offered superior post-impact mechanical properties at low and intermediate impact energies, yet very similar results under high impact energies.",

A plan of experiments is carried out to investigate the optimal level of control factors using Taguchi orthogonal arrays design that lead to minimization of erosion rate. The steady state erosion responses of these composites are investigated with respect to impingement angle, impact velocity and erodent size by keeping other factors constant. The dynamic mechanical properties were evaluated to determine possible correlation with erosion rate of these composites. The storage modulus (E???) steadily increases up to 3927 MPa for 40 wt.% fiber, but on further increase in the fiber content, the E??? value decrease to 3321 MPa at 0 ??C. The maximum storage modulus was obtained at 40 wt.% of fiber contents which may be due to the maximum stress-transfer between the fibers and matrix. Cole-Cole plot of hybrid composites was made at different fiber contents to evaluate the heterogeneity of the system. Finally, a wicket plot is also studied to observe the material behavior, in terms of relaxation of materials. The worn surface of composites were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe the mechanism of erosion. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

The present paper is an application of life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in order to explore the possibility of improving the eco efficiency of glass fibre composite materials by replacing part of the glass fibres with hemp mats. The main purpose and contribution of this study is the exploration of the eco-efficiency of this new material. To a minor degree, it is also a contribution in the sense that it provides life cycle inventory data on composites, which as yet is scarce in the LCA community. The study is a development of a previous work conducted on a pipe system used to transport cooling sea waters in a Sicilian petrochemical company. A comparative LCA was performed of two different elbow-fittings made of glass fibre/thermoset composite and hybrid (glass fibre-hemp)/thermoset composite, respectively. Primary data were collected mainly for the manufacturing process of the composite, while the Ecoinvent v2.2 database (PR??-Product Ecology Consultants, 2012) was used to model other parts of the system. Significant environmental benefits of using hemp mats were found mainly in the production phase. An LCC was also carried out from cradle to grave to find ways to optimise the costs. Material costs reduction was significant for the hybrid elbow formulation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

An optimal cruciform geometry is introduced first based on finite element (FE) simulation. Characterization testing is performed successively on uniaxial and cruciform specimens to determine equivalent loaded area, notch sensitivity behavior and critical fracture toughness properties of cross-ply GFRP laminates. In experimental biaxial testing, two types of crack orientations (0°, 45°) are studied with varying crack lengths. The experimental failure points show that cross-ply GFRP laminates attain higher load bearing capability under biaxial tensile–tensile loading compared to uniaxial testing. Appropriate non-dimensional geometry factor relevant to cruciform shape is determined based on experimental data points and FE simulation. Eventually, a mixed-mode fracture criterion is proposed for cross-ply composite laminate based on the findings from biaxial experimental loading.",

Control specimens (group A) did not contain fiber reinforcement. Fibers were placed with different positions and orientations into the test specimens (2 mm x 2 mm x 25 mm) (groups B, C, D). The test specimens (n = 10) were stored in distilled water for 3 days at 37 degrees C before testing in a three-point loading test (ISO 10477) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min to determine FS, flexural modulus (FM), and toughness. Data were analyzed with 1-way analysis of variance and Tukey HSD (sigma= 0.05).\n\nRESULTS: The FM varied from 4.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.7 +/- 0.5 GPa. The lowest flexural strength and toughness values in reinforced specimens resulted from compression side fiber reinforcement (132 +/- 12 MPa, 21 +/- 4 MJ) and the highest from curved fiber reinforcement (174 +/- 8 MPa, 83 +/- 28 MJ), though this was not statistically significant from tension-side reinforcement. Although the toughness of the curved reinforced group was significantly higher than other groups, the flexural strength of curved reinforcement was not significantly higher than tension-side reinforcement.\n\nCONCLUSION: Position and fiber orientation influenced the flexural strength, FM, and toughness. The most effective in increasing toughness was curved placement of fibers.",

The analyzed factors were the barrel temperature profile, the injection speed and the screw speed. To maximize the flexural strength response variable and the surface quality, all studied parameters should be maintained at the higher levels. The analysis of microstructure of composites molded demonstrates that this combination of parameters promotes a greater orientation of the fibers in the outer layers, as well as prevents the migration of glass fiber to surface of the composite. This kind of microstructure is favorable to a better surface quality, and a greater flexural strength.",

This interlayer primarily serves as a means of preventing splintering and of absorbing energy upon blast/impact. This research attempted to enhance the impact resistance of LG by increasing PVB interlayer energy absorption by embedding carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Interlayers were formed by electrospinning aligned PVB fibers mat embedded with various concentrations of CNTs. Subsequently, the fiber mat was hot-pressed between two glass plies forming a composite film. The composite fibers were characterized using optical, SEM, and TEM microscopy. The mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of fibers were determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and the energy absorption capacities of the modified LGs were measured by applying the Charpy impact test of un-notched samples. A???30% increase in composite fiber (CNT 1.5wt.%) strength was observed, along with a???70% increase in elastic modulus, measured at a strain rate of 0.1min 
                        -1, in comparison to CNT-free fibers. Increased CNT loading restricted the segmental motion of polymer macromolecules and provided the geometrical confinement effect to neighboring macromolecules in the nanoscale fiber. The energy absorption of a double-layered LG embedded with carbon nanotubes increased by nearly 341%, where experimental results demonstrated the role of the CNTs pull-out toughening mechanism. In parallel, transmission of visible light decreased by 60%. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

In the paper, the sintering behavior of transparent materials with a higher transmittance over 90% is demonstrated. Phenol-formaldehyde resin- (PF-) coated silica sand composite powders were sintered by a fiber laser considering their high transmittance at 1064 nm wavelength. The affluences of process parameters on the dimension, shrinkage depth and porosity of the sintered sample were studied, and microstructures by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were observed. Furthermore, the absorption and transmission of laser beam within the powder bed were investigated based on a developed analytical model and the Zemax optical design program. Experimental results showed that composite powders could be successfully sintered by the fiber laser. That was because poor absorption of laser energy could still raise the temperature of the PF shell over its glass transition point. However, the heat absorbed within the powder bed was not uniform by the action of the convergence of the micro spherical lens from the transparent composite powder. Finally, some components were manufactured and the feasibility of using this process to build casting molds was verified. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

The polyester resins, because of their versatility and low cost, are widely used in polymer composites. Natural fiber (NF) unsaturated polyester (UP) composites show lower density, equal flexural modulus, and comparable flexural strength but relatively poor impact strength as compared to a glass fiber (GF) composites. Engineered bio-fibers are defined as a blend of surface treated bast and a leaf fiber. Selection of blends of biofibers is also based on the fact that the correct blend achieves an optimum balance in mechanical properties. The Kenaf and/or Hemp based composites exhibit excellent tensile and flexural properties, while leaf fiber composites give the best impact properties of the composites. A blended composition of two bast and one leaf fiber is selected to achieve a balance of flexural and impact properties of the targeted bio-composites. Biocomposites can now compete with glass-polyester composites both on a cost and performance basis. Most of the existing results on biocomposites are based on hand-lay-up labscale fabrication techniques.",

The results from the experimental tests have been compared with predictions obtained by applying a micro-mechanical model, which allowed taking into account the fibre length distribution and the properties of the phases of the composite.

          "abstract": "Recent advances in polymer technology have given rise to new research regarding conventional building materials like concrete and the rheological material properties of polymer fiber-concrete composites. Polymers such as polypropylene fiber are now the industry standard for manufacture of geosynthetics which are used as the structural element in earth walls, stabilized slopes, and to improve soft soil bearing capacity. Both industry and researchers now recognize the benefits of polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete in reducing temperature and shrinkage cracking and crack widths, which is important distress criteria in airfield pavements. However, little attention has been given to the use of high tensile strength polypropylene as a structural component of concrete pavements. As important as the research, is the methodology used to obtain the results. There is a need to consider concrete mixture design and selection in conjunction with pavement design since specific mixture properties&#039; behavior and performance - characteristics are set by pavement design requirements. Such approach will permit the development of an &quot;integrated mixture selection- pavement design methodology&quot;. This study quantified the beneficial strength properties of small volume (less than 0.5%) polypropylene fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) as an airfield pavement to meet both military and civilian aviation needs. Polypropylene fiber reinforcement in small volumes displays none of the historical problems of poor workability, or excessive pavement deflections associated with fiber-concrete composites in larger volumes. Through laboratory testing of material properties such as fatigue, toughness and flexural strength and computer modeling this composite showed a consistent improvement in those strength properties that would increase the life of the pavement structure under repetitive aircraft traffic. Perhaps, the most unique property of this composite is its ability to continue to absorb energy after first crack, ductile properties not typically associated with a brittle material like concrete. This increase in toughness is significant to the military in mitigating heaved pavement around bomb damaged runway craters during rapid runway repair. Analogues to safety glass, FRC will mitigate radial fracturing of airfield pavement located around the crater impact area reducing time to repair heaved pavement, an important criteria to air base survivability. This dissertation serves as a blueprint to comprehensively evaluate both design and performance of any fiber concrete composite.",

Past studies show that only artificial fibers such as glass, carbon etc., have been used in fiber-reinforced plastics. Although glass and other synthetic fiber-reinforced plastics possess high specific strength, their fields of application are very limited because of their inherent higher cost of production. In this connection, an investigation has been carried out to make use of coir, a natural fiber abundantly available in India. Natural fibers are not only strong and lightweight but also relatively very cheap. In the present work, coir composites are developed and their mechanical properties are evaluated. Scanning electron micrographs obtained from fractured surfaces were used for a qualitative evaluation of the interfacial properties of coir/epoxy and compared with glass fiber/epoxy. These results indicate that coir can be used as a potential reinforcing material for making low load bearing thermoplastic composites.",

Although dry neat nylon is brittle with only a moderate K(c) value (4.2 MPa square-root m), additions of either second phase produce rising K(R)-curves and associated high K(c) values (8.1 MPa square-root m for rubber-toughened nylon, and 10.0 MPa square-root m for 17 vol% glass-fiber neat nylon). In the rubber-modified resin, the high K(c) value is associated with extensive plastic blunting at the crack tip. In the fiber-reinforced neat resin, K(c) is improved due to a combination of fiber-bridging and increased strength, the latter being associated with additional load carrying capacity of the fibers. When both rubber and fibers are added, however. no further increase in K(c) is noted (K(c) = 9.3 MPa square-root m for 17 vol% glass-fiber rubber-modified nylon). The extent of ductile blunting in the rubber + fiber resin is not as great as in the rubber-only resin. Furthermore, the fracture strength of the rubber + fiber resin is not as high as the fiber-only resin. The net result is a balance of properties for the rubber-toughened composite.",

Plasticizer contents from 20 to 35 wt% and fiber contents of 10 and 40 wt% were used. The compounded composites were injection molded to tensile test specimens. The effect of processing, melt viscosity and fiber type on the fiber length was investigated. The lengths of fully processed fibers were determined by dissolving the matrix and measuring the length of the remaining fibers by microscope analysis. A clear reductive effect of the processing on the fiber length was noticed. A reduction of fiber length along the increasing fiber content and the decreasing plasticizer content was also detected. This reduction originated from the increasing shear forces during compounding, which again depended on the increased viscosity of the material. Hemp fibers were shown to remain longer and fibrillate more than flax fibers, leading to higher aspect ratio. Thus, the reinforcement efficiency of hemp fibers by the processing was improved, in contrast with flax fibers. In addition, the analysis of fiber dispersion and orientation showed a good dispersion of fibers in the matrix, and a predominant orientation of the fibers in the melt flow direction.",

Tests on FMLs, based on 2024-O and 2024-T3 aluminum alloys, were undertaken using a nitrogen gas gun at velocities up to 150 m/s. The failure processes in the FMLs were investigated by examining the samples after impact and by sectioning a number of specimens through the point of impact. The impact response of these multilayered samples was also characterized by measuring the residual out-of-plane displacement of the targets after testing. Energy absorption in the FMLs occurred through gross plastic deformation, membrane stretching and tearing in the aluminum plies, as well as delamination, fiber fracture, and matrix cracking in the composite layers. In the multilayered FMLs, the permanent displacement at the perforation threshold remained roughly constant over a range of target configurations, suggesting that the aluminum layers deform almost independently through a membrane stretching mechanism during the perforation process. The impact resistances of the laminates investigated were compared by determining their specific perforation energies (s.p.e.), where it was shown that s.p.e. of several of laminates was almost three times that of the corresponding aluminum alloy. The perforation resistances of the FMLs as well as those of the plain composite were predicted using the Reid-Wen perforation model. Here good agreement was noted between the model and the experimental data for the range of laminates investigated here.",

The damage fatigue model has been formulated in terms of strain energy and was implemented into the finite element code ABAQUS/Standard through a user defined material subroutine UMAT. The present paper focuses mainly on the identification strategy based on homogeneous and heterogeneous fatigue tests. Damage parameters governing longitudinal and transversal damage (dLL and dTT) are identified from homogeneous tension-tension fatigue tests performed in both material directions. The damage parameters governing the shear induced damage (dLT) are identified using heterogeneous fatigue tests carried out on a specific configuration. This heterogeneous fatigue test gives rise to non-uniform distributions of the in-plane strain components: ??LL, ??TT and ??LT. Heterogeneous strain fields are measured by the digital image correlation technique (DIC) during the fatigue test. The in-plane strain components are coupled to numerical computations through an inverse method to determine the parameters set governing the shear induced damage. The comparison between the damage model predictions and the damage curves obtained from fatigue tests shows a good agreement in both material directions. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Quasi-static axial crushing was used for fiber orientation angles of 90 and 80?? with semi-vertex angles of 5, 10 and 20??. Six initial cone diameters were selected. Four layers of glass/epoxy and eight layers of cotton/epoxy were fabricated by a filament winding process. The load/displacement response was plotted and the energy absorption values were calculated for all composite cones tested. A finite-element analysis for cones of the same dimensions and materials was also done. Results from this investigation show that the load required and the specific energy absorption for glass/epoxy cones were higher than those for cotton/epoxy cones for all the cases studied. It has been found that there is a slight increase in the load capability and the energy absorption when using fabricated composite cones of 80?? fiber orientation angle instead of 90?? for both of cotton-and glass/epoxy cones. It has also been observed that with increasing cone angle from 5 to 20?? for all the tested specimens, composite cones can withstand higher loads and the specific energy absorption was improved. The percentage increase in load capacity for cotton/epoxy cones varies between 27.5 and 35.2% and for glass/epoxy cones 37 and 42.4%. The specific energy absorption was in the range of 8.6-13.3% for cotton fiber/epoxy cones and 12.6-24.2 for glass/epoxy cones.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a combined experimental and numerical study of free vibration of industry-driven woven fiber glass/epoxy (G/E) composite plates with delamination. Using the first-order shear deformation theory, an eight-noded two-dimensional quadratic isoparametric element was developed, which has five degrees of freedom per node. In the experimental study, the influence of various parameters such as the delamination size, boundary conditions, fiber orientations, number of layers, and aspect ratio on the natural frequencies of delaminated composite plates are investigated. Comparison of the numerical results with experimental ones shows good agreement. Fundamental natural frequencies are found to decrease with the increase in the delamination size and fiber orientation and increases with the increase in the number of layers and aspect ratio of delaminated composite plates. The natural frequency of the delaminated composite plate varies significantly for different boundary conditions. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",

Glass mat thermoplastic (GMT) material is a promising material that has good mechanical strength, impact energy absorbing capacity and recuperability. It is more and more used in automobile body for the purpose of lightweighting and environmental protection. In this paper, the high strain rate mechanical property of one GMT material is studied using the split Hopkinson pressure bar technique. The test result is analyzed for its applicability in automobile body and a material replacing method from original steel sheet to GMT sheet is found. Then the computer simulation is carried out for a car crashing into a rigid wall before and after some of its parts made such material replacement. The simulation results show that the method presented in this paper for GMT material application in automobile body is applicable. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced composites (FRC) have the potential for use as load-bearing orthopaedic implants if the high strength and elastic modulus of FRC implant can be matched with local requirements. This study tested the in vivo performance of novel FRC implants made of unidirectional glass fibers (E-glass fibers in Bis-GMA and TEGDMA polymeric matrix). The implant surface was covered with bioactive glass granules. Control implants were made of surface-roughened titanium. Stress-shielding effects of the implants were predicted by finite element modelling (FEM). Surgical stabilization of bone metastasis in the subtrochanteric region of the femur was simulated in 12 rabbits. An oblong subtrochanteric defect of a standardized size (reducing the torsional strength of the bones approximately by 66%) was created and an intramedullary implant made of titanium or the FRC composite was inserted. The contralateral femur served as the intact control. At 12 weeks of healing, the femurs were harvested and analyzed by radiography, torsional testing, micro-CT imaging and hard tissue histology. The functional recovery was unremarkable in both groups, although the final analysis revealed two healed undisplaced peri-implant fractures in the group of FRC implants. FEM studies demonstrated differences in stress-shielding effects of the titanium and FRC implants, but the expected biological consequences did not become evident during the follow-up time of the animal study. Biomechanical testing of the retrieved femurs showed no significant differences between the groups. The torsional strength of the fixed bones had returned the level of contralateral intact femurs. Both implants showed ongrowth of intramedullary new bone. No adverse tissue reactions were observed. Based on these favorable results, a large-scale EU-project (NewBone, www.hb.se/ih/polymer/newbone) has been launched for development of orthopaedic FRC implants. ?? 2008 IPEM.",

A series of plaques of unsaturated polyster composite were resin transfer molded with an A-glass continuous strand mat (CSM) and a control with E-glass CSM. The influence of fiber volume fraction on the physical and thermo-mechanical properties of the resultant composites were investigated, both before and after environmental exposure. At the maximum fiber fraction considered (nominally 29 vol%), the use of A-glass reinforcement lowered the warp direction tensile modulus from 8.6 to 7.6 GPa and strength from 139 to 100 MPa, relative to the control. Similar results were observed for both the flexural and the tensile properties, irrespective of fiber fraction and test direction (warp vs. weft), for the A-glass reinforcement. Environmental exposure was found to affect equally the properties of A-glass and E-glass fiber reinforced composites. Based upon microscopic analyses and constituent properties, the lower mechanical properties of the A-glass fibers composites have been linked to the lower properties of A-glass fibers relative to E-glass fibers. The experimental results were also used to test a micro-mechanics models for random fiber reinforced composites. Reasonable correlation was found between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions. To offset their lower mechanical properties, A-glass fibers could be used as a reinforcement in composite applications by simply increasing the fiber fraction relative to their E-glass counterpart.",

Two types of hybrid composites were constructed using fiber combinations of PVA and glass (either continuous glass or 38-mm chopped strand), and PVA and fibrillated polypropylene networks. The tensile stress-strain behavior of these hybrids was studied, showing that the fibers, when used in a hybrid form, could result in superior composite performance compared to their individual fiber reinforced cements. The PVA-glass hybrid composite allowed similar or more favorable composite properties to be achieved at a lower addition of the high elongation fibers when compared to polypropylene-glass hybrids.(1) In comparison with the hybrids containing glass fibers (i.e., polypropylene-glass(1) and PVA-glass), the PVA-polypropylene hybrid was less efficient at small strains (say, up to 1 percent) because of the high elongation of both fibers at small strains. However the PVA-polypropylene combination was advantageous in achieving high ultimate composite strength because the PVA and the polypropylene could simultaneously contribute to the composite strength, and because of the synergistic interaction between the two reinforcing fibers.",

In this paper, we review recent advances in the modeling of glass transition range behavior based on the enthalpy landscape approach. We also give an overview of new simulation techniques for implementation of enthalpy landscape models, including techniques for mapping the landscape and computing the long-time dynamics of the system. When combined with these new computational techniques, the enthalpy landscape approach can provide for the predictive modeling of glass transition and relaxation behavior on a laboratory time scale. We also discuss new insights from the enthalpy landscape approach into the nature of the supercooled liquid and glassy states. In particular, the enthalpy landscape approach provides for natural resolutions of both the Kauzmann paradox and the question of residual entropy of glass at absolute zero. We further show that the glassy state cannot be described in terms of a mixture of equilibrium liquid states, indicating that there is no microscopic basis for the concept of a fictive temperature distribution and that the glass and liquid are two fundamentally different states. We also discuss the connection between supercooled liquid fragility and the ideal glass transition.",

Based on AE tests, the fracture behaviors are studied for the material. In the study of GFR composite fracture behavior, classical linear fracture mechanics method is used for comparison. The exponential constant m value used to determine the relationship between stress and stress intensity factor are compared relative to the classical fracture mechanics and the AE techniques. In order to demonstrate the advantage of the wavelet-based AE techniques, the conventional AE analysis is also provided side-by-side for comparison. The results verify that the wavelet-based method better approximates residual strength relative to the classical AE techniques.

Methods: Sixty extracted intact upper premolars were collected, treated endodontically (except for the control group), and divided into 5 test groups (n = 12) depending on the restoration type: G1 (control group, untreated teeth), G2 (MOD preparation without restoration), G3 (MOD preparation with resin composite restoration), G4 (MOD preparation with resin composite restoration and a horizontal fiber post inserted between buccal and palatal walls), and G5 (MOD preparation with a horizontal fiber post only). The specimens were stored in normal saline at 37??C for 2 months. Then specimens were quasi-statically loaded in a universal testing machine until fracture occurred. Failure loads were then analyzed with one-way analysis of variance, followed by multiple comparisons by using Tukey honestly significant difference test (?? = .05). The mode of failure was determined by visual inspection. Results: Mean (standard deviation) failure loads for groups ranged from 411.8 N (??103.9) to 994.5 N (??147.3). One-way analysis of variance showed significant differences between fracture resistances of groups (P &lt; .001). Tukey honestly significant difference test showed significant differences in fracture resistance within groups (P ??? .05) except between the G1 (control group) and group G4 (P ??? .05).

Samples were loaded under bending conditions with stresses both in the elastic and plastic fields, with the result that characteristics in a flexural mode were able to be determined and the ensuing decrease in characteristics was fitted to an exponential model. The degree of losses ranged from 25 to 31% for the bending modulus, from 28 to 35% for the flexural strength, and from 40 to 51% for the specific fracture energy. The most notable losses were for specimens immersed in artificial sea water under a continuous stress of 140 MPa, corresponding to the plastic behavior of the material. Although the existence of matrix plasticization is doubtful, the osmotic effects of the diffusion on the matrix and the junction to the fibers, the presence of microcracks, and the effects of chemical ions in the medium on the surface fiber composition became evident in the strength degradation of the material.",

The organosilane was used as the binder in the slurry-blade process and isolated pores in micrometer size are formed due to the decomposition of polymerization product derived from organosilane and nano-silica aerogel particles at high temperature. These pores can effectively decrease the thermal conductivity of coating layer. The composite glass coating shows good stability at 823 K in air. However, significant microstructural changes in the coating were observed after aging at 923 K, at which the isolated micro-sized pores grew to sub-millimeter pores while the continuous composite glass coating was still maintained. The glass coated skutterudite materials show good oxidation resistance, i. e. no oxides are observed even after heating at 923 K in ambient air.

The stiffness change in the axial and hoop directions, fatigue life curves, biaxial fatigue envelopes at various lives, and failure mechanisms are discussed. It is noted that optimum fiber placement in principal directions may lead to a weak behaviour for an intermediate loading combination. It is also found that monotonic test data are not a good indicator of the fatigue behaviour. Furthermore, imperfections in the manufacturing process lead to early damage initiation under cyclic loading, and result in shorter fatigue lives to leakage. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The present study reveals that the transverse thermal conductivities of the FFRC are improved up to ∼1040% and ∼400% over those of the composite without CNTs when the values of CNT volume factions present in the FFRC are 6.88% and 4.27%, respectively.

The LFTs are processed with a thermoplastic matrix such as polypropylene (PP) or polyamide (PAI) reinforced with long glass (or carbon, aramid, etc.) fibers, with starting fiber lengths &gt;12mm, through a pultrusion processing method. The LFT components are typically produced using extrusion-compression molding. In the present work, a bus seat was chosen as a candidate component to assess the viability of LFT technology to reduce weight and cost, without compromising performance over presently used designs. A conservative estimate of 43% weight reduction and 18% cost reduction per seat was predicted over presently implemented seat designs that contain a circumferential steel frame. Cadpress-Thermoplastic (EXPRESS) compression molding software for LFTs was utilized for the process modeling. Flow simulation during the compression molding of E-glass/PP LFT was conducted. Finite element stress analysis was conducted to verify mechanical properties developed as a result of fiber orientation and distribution after flow simulation. This article covers the design, process modeling, component verification, and manufacturing studies conducted for the LFT bus seat.",

All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.",

          "abstract": "Epileptogenesis, the transformation of the brain to a long-lasting state characterized by recurrent sei- zures, can occur due to genetic or acquired mecha- nisms. The mutant genes for three idiopathic syndromes (begin familial neonatal convulsions, gen- eralized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus and auto- somal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy) and two of the progressive myoclonus epilepsies (Unver- richt-Lundborg disease and Lafora disease) have been identified. The underlying genetic defects for common idiopathic generalized syndromes, such as absence epilepsies and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, have not yet been precisely determined. Acquired epileptogenesis can be an acute or chronic process. The role of acute epileptogenesis in the final clinical expression of human epilepsy is unclear but needs further investigation. Among the chronic acquired partial epilepsies, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis has been extensively stud- ied. Two hypotheses structural of epileptogenesis, involving reorganization, have been proposed mossy fiber sprouting and dormant basket cell. Altered neurotransmitter expression, including increased activation of glutamate receptors and de- creased GABA-mediated inhibition, is also impor- tant. Kindling and secondary epileptogenesis may play a role in some patients with intractable TLE. An autoimmune mechanism has been implicated in Rasmussens encephalitis. Generalized absence epi- lepsy appears to result from a perturbation of the thalamocortical circuit. Clinical differences between seizures in neonates and infants, and those occurring in adults are likely related to maturational differences in cellular and molecular mechanisms. In the future, new therapies to prevent epileptogenesis (antiepileptogenic drugs) may be developed based on improved knowledge of the basic mechanisms of epilepsy.",

          "abstract": "Extensive research has led to a better understanding of the application of various corrosion protection methods in reinforced concrete (RC) structures and the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) rebars is a typical example. However different fibres come along with different deficiencies, such as low elastic moduli and poor alkaline resistance in glass fibre (Saikia et al. 2007); brittle fracture and high cost in carbon fibre. Taking advantages of the strength of different fibres and the cost effectiveness of steel fibre, a hybrid composite rebar was recently developed. Steel fibers and glass fibers are distributed within the core, while aramid and carbon fibers created a shell for strength and corrosion protection. A series of concrete beams reinforced with the proposed hybrid rebars were tested and it was demonstrated that the beams have the ability to undergo large inelastic deformations, and the ductility indexes were found to be similar conventional steel-reinforced beams. Besides, accelerated alkaline ageing tests were performed using concrete pore solutions at different temperatures, and the service life and alkaline resistance of the proposed rebar were proven to be very good.",

It ensures that the complete cross-linking takes place to produce the targeted properties of composites. In this work infrared radiation (IR) post curing process for glass fiber reinforced polymer composite laminates is studied as an alternative to conventional thermal cure. Distance from the IR source, curing schedule and volume of the composite were selected as the IR cure parameters for optimization. Design of experiments (DOE) approach was adopted for conducting the experiments. Tensile strength and flexural strength of the composite laminate were the responses measured to select the final cure parameters. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), surface plots and contour plots clearly demonstrate that the distance from the IR source and volume of the composite contribute nearly 70% to the response functions. This establishes that polymer composites cured using IR technique can achieve the same properties using only 25% of the total time compared to that of conventional thermal curing.",

A simplified steel-composite combined beam structure is used for three-point bending tests. Epoxy-based structural foam and 33% short glass fiber reinforced nylon composite insert are considered as composite fillers in empty sections of double hat-type steel beam structure. Four cases based on the different combination of composite materials are considered. In the series of physical three-point bending tests, the force-displacement (F-D) curves and material behaviors are investigated. The test results show that the composite insert greatly contributes to improve the crashworthiness of beam structure as well as to reduce the vehicle weight. Especially, the adhesive failure of structural foam and the brittle fracture mode of composite insert are greatly influential to the resistance force level in the three-point bending test. In the numerical study, a concern is to build a practical FE model, which can be used in full-scale vehicle crash simulation. The parametric study shows that parameters related to material and contact types are critical to simulate the adhesive failure of structural foam and the brittle fracture of composite insert. The final simulation results show good agreement with the physical tests.",

In group DCT, the quartz fibre post (D.T. Light-post) was cemented with resin cement (DUO-LINK) and a core foundation was formed with composite resin (LIGHT-CORE). In group DMO and DMT, resin cement (DUO-LINK) was used for post (D.T. Light-post) cementation and core foundation; in group DMO, these procedures were performed simultaneously in one step, while DMT group was accomplished in separated two steps. In group LCT, the glass fiber post (LuxaPost) cementation and core foundation was accomplished with composite resin (LuxaCore-Dual) in separated procedures. Tooth were prepared with 2 mm ferrule and restored with nickel-chromium crowns. A static loading test was carried out and loads were applied to the buccal surface of the buccal cusp at a 45 degree inclination to the long axis of the tooth until failure occurred. The data were analyzed with MANOVA (α = .05). The failure pattern was observed and classified as either favorable (allowing repair) or unfavorable (not allowing repair).\n\nRESULTS: The mean fracture strength was highest in group DCT followed in descending order by groups DMO, DMT, and LCT. However, there were no significant differences in fracture strength between the groups. A higher prevalence of favorable fractures was detected in group DMT but there were no significant differences between the groups.\n\nCONCLUSION: The change of post or core foundation method does not appear to influence the fracture strength and failure patterns.",

The rheological properties of such composites in the molten state have been studied using different rheometers. A capillary rheometer has been constructed and mounted on a molding-injection machine. The shear viscosity of filled PP determined from the capillary rheometer, after corrections for entrance effects, was found to be very close to that of unfilled PP. However, large excess pressure losses at the capillary entrance were observed and these data have been used to obtain an apparent elongational viscosity. The apparent elongational viscosity was shown to be considerably larger than the shear viscosity for PP and filled PP, and it increased markedly with fiber length and fiber content. Rotational rheometers with a parallel-plate geometry were used to investigate the viscoelastic properties of these composites and their behavior was found to be non-linear, exhibiting a yield stress. A model is proposed to describe the shear viscosity from a solid-like behavior at low stresses to fluid-like behavior at high shear stresses taking into account fiber content and orientation. A modified model, proposed for elongational flow, describes relatively well the apparent elongational data. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

However, the influence of fiber reinforcement, cementation technique, and physical stress on the fracture resistance of metal-free crowns is unknown. Purpose This in vitro study evaluated the effect of fiber reinforcement, physical stress, and cementation methods on the fracture resistance of posterior metal-free Sinfony crowns. Material and methods Ninety-six extracted human third molars received a standardized tooth preparation: 0.5-mm chamfer preparation and occlusal reduction of 1.3 to 1.5 mm. Sinfony (nonreinforced crowns, n=48) and Sinfony-Vectris (reinforced crowns, n=48) crowns restoring original tooth contour were prepared. Twenty-four specimens of each crown type were cemented, using either glass ionomer cement (GIC) or resin cement. Thirty-two crowns (one third) were stored in humidity for 48 hours. Another third was exposed to 10,000 thermal cycles (TC) between 5??C and 55??C. The remaining third was treated with thermal cycling and mechanical loading (TCML), consisting of 1.2 million axial loads of 50 N. The artificial crowns were then vertically loaded with a steel sphere until failure occurred. Significant differences in fracture resistance (N) between experimental groups were assessed by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test (??=.05). Results Fifty percent of the Sinfony and Sinfony-Vectris crowns cemented with glass ionomer cement loosened after thermal cycling. Thermal cycling resulted in a significant reduction in the mean fracture resistance for Sinfony crowns cemented with GIC, from 2037 N to 1282 N (P=.004). Additional fatigue produced no further effects. Fiber reinforcement significantly increased fracture resistance, from 1555 N to 2326 N (P=.001). The minimal fracture resistance was above 600 N for all combinations of material, cement and loading. Conclusion Fracture resistance of metal-free Sinfony crowns was significantly increased by fiber reinforcement. Adhesive cementation may be recommended to avoid cementation failure.",

          "abstract": "The mechanical properties of nylon 6 and its blends with maleated ethylene–propylene rubber (EPR-g-MA) plus glass fibers were examined as a function of the chemical functionality of the silane surface treatment applied to the glass fibers. Three reactive silane coupling agents, with anhydride, epoxy, or amine functionality, were used and found to have little effect on the mechanical properties when no EPR-g- MAis present. When 20 wt% EPR-g-MA is used as a rubber toughener, however, the yield strength and Izod impact strength were lowest for the amine functional silane and highest for the anhydride silane, while the epoxy silane fell in-between. These results were attributed to the differences in reactivity of the three reactive silanes. An unreactive silane (octyl groups) was used as a release agent on the glass fibers and compared with the anhydride functional silane. The octyl silane did not improve the ductility of the composite, as may have been speculated, and had poor yield strength and impact resistance when compared to the anhydride silane. Both octyl and anhydride treated glass fibers improve the heat distortion temperature such that most of the high temperature stiffness that is lost on addition of EPR-g-MA is regained by adding glass fibers",

It was established that the failure of SGF-PP did not alter with the loading; this composite failed mostly by matrix deformation along with fiber/matrix debonding and some fiber pull-out. The failure mode of the LGF-PP differed from that scenario, since fiber fracture was resolved in every stage of the loading. On the contrary to SGF-PP, the failure of this composite was governed by fiber-related events (fracture, pull-out, debonding). The amplitude and energy of the AE signals were assigned to individual failure events and thus the failure sequence concluded.",

Also, conventional weighing, determination of wear volume, specific wear rate and examination of the worn surface morphological features by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed. The results showed varied responses under different abrading distance because of the inclusion of different loads of SiO2 particles. Silicon Dioxide as the filler in particulate form reduced the steady state wear rate of G-E, the optimum reduction in wear was found to occur at 10 wt% of SiO2 filler loading. Selected mechanical properties such as hardness, tensile strength, and elongation at break were analyzed for investigating wear property correlations. Wear of G-E composite was found to be mainly due to a micro-cracking and fiber fracture mechanisms. It was found that the micro- cracking mechanism had been caused by progressive surface damage.",

The thermal and mechanical properties of PP–PPE composites were studied by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with reference to the fiber concentration. Although, by increasing PP fiber concentration in PPE, no significant difference was found in melting and crystallization temperatures of the PPE, the storage, and the tensile and flexural modulus of the composites increased linearly with fiber concentrations up to 50%, 1.5, 1.0, 1.3 GPa, respectively, which was approximately four times higher than that for the pure PPE. There is a shift in glass transition temperature of the composite with increasing fiber concentration in the composite and the damping peak became flatter, which indicates the effectiveness of fiber–matrix interaction. A higher concentration of long fibers (&gt;50% w/w) resulted in fiber packing problems, difficulty in dispersion, and an increase in void content, which led to a reduction in modulus. Cox–Krenchel and Haplin–Tsai equations were used to predict tensile modulus of random fiber-reinforced composites. A Cole–Cole analysis was performed to understand the phase behavior of the composites. A master curve was constructed based on time–temperature superposition (TTS) by using data over the temperature range from −50 to 90°C, which allowed for the prediction of very long and short time behavior of the composite.",

          "abstract": "There have been numerous studies on the composite laminated structures which find many applications in many engineering fields namely aerospace, biomedical, civil, marine and mechanical engineering because of their ease of handling, good mechanical properties and low fabrication cost. They also possess excellent damage tolerance and impact resistance. The mechanical behaviour of composite structures is of particular interest to engineers in modern technology. Buckling of plates is a well-established branch of research in composite structures stability. It has a wide range of applications in engineering science and technology. Buckling behaviour of laminated composite plates subjected to in-plane loads is an important consideration in the preliminary design of aircraft and launch vehicle components. The sizing of many structural subcomponents of these vehicles is often determined by stability constraints. Plates with circular holes and other openings are extensively used as structural members in aircraft design. The buckling behaviour of such plates has always received much attention by researchers. These holes can be access holes, holes for hardware to pass through, or in the case of fuselage, windows and doors. In some cases holes are used to reduce the weight of the structure. In aerospace and many other applications these structural components are also made up of composite material to further reduce the weight of the structure. The outstanding mechanical properties of composite structures, such as durability and corrosion-resistance characteristics combined with low density, make it more attractive compared to conventional materials. In this study, the influence of cut-out shape, length/thickness ratio, and ply orientation and aspect ratio on the buckling of woven glass epoxy laminated composite plate is examined experimentally. Clamped free -Clamped-free boundary condition is considered for all case. Experiments have been carried out on laminated composites with circular, square and rectangular cut-outs. The thickness of the plate was changed by increasing the number of layers. After the buckling experiments micro electroscopic scanning was performed for the failed specimens. Comparisons are made between the test results, by using two different approach. The results shows effect of various cut-out shapes, orientation of fiber, aspect ratio and length to thickness ratio on the buckling load.",

          "abstract": "Recently, robot structures handling liquid crystal display (LCD) glass panels are increased in size of LCD is increased. In order to handle large LCD panels, the robot structures should have high stiffness to reduce the deflection of robot end effector under the weights of LCD. The LCD manufacturing industries have a trend to employ double arm type robots rather than single arm type robots to increase productivity. Currently, two aluminum wrist blocks that have different configurations not to interfere with each other are mounted on the robot arms. The aluminum wrist block becomes one of the largest deflection sources as the size of the robot structures increases. Since the size of the wrist block can not be increased indefinitely to increase the stiffness due to the limitation of driving motor power, the best way to increase the stiffness of the wrist block is to employ carbon fiber epoxy composite material for structural material of the wrist block because the carbon fiber epoxy composite material has much higher specific stiffness and damping than aluminum. In this work, the two wrist blocks for the double arm type robot for handling large LCD glass panels were designed and manufactured using foam core sandwich structure. Finite element analysis was used along with an optimization routine to design the composite wrist blocks. Box type sandwich structures were employed to reduce shear effect arising from the low modulus of polyurethane foam core. The weight reduction of the composite wrist blocks was more than 50% compared to those of comparable aluminum wrist blocks and found that the composite wrist blocks had much improved performances compared to those of the aluminum wrist blocks from the static and dynamic tests. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The proposed sensing system, consisting of two coupled fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, allows the simultaneous measurement of both temperature and strain by decoupling the change in reflected wavelength induced by temperature variations from that induced by either mechanical or apparent strain, with significant advantages either for monitoring the composite cure kinetics, as described in the accompanying paper (Part I), or for assessing the structural response to thermo-mechanical loads. Both thermal ramp and mechanical static/dynamic bending tests were performed in the laboratory on instrumented GFRP samples with 12, 18 and 24 layers. It was shown that, by combining the wavelength shift outputs of the two fiber Bragg gratings, the longitudinal material CTE coefficient can be evaluated with ± 3% accuracy. This parameter can be used to discriminate mechanical and apparent strains from the FBG reflected spectrum. Static four-point bending tests showed good agreement between values measured by the embedded strain grating and those predicted by the classical lamination theory of composite materials, being the maximum deviation within 2%. Dynamic tests performed with both sinusoidal and square wave inputs have proved the effectiveness of the proposed solution to track the strain field accurately up to 10 Hz.",

Herein an innovative design based on integrated computational models and full-scale tests is presented to address the viability of reinstating capacity to offshore pipelines and risers. The experimental program was based on a collaborative test matrix developed with the participation of composite repair manufacturers.

The final result remained stable at 5 years posttreatment.\n\nRESULTS: The correction of the Class II malocclusion took 24 months. The Targis-Vectris method ensured maintenance of tooth position and periodontal condition.\n\nCONCLUSION: The Targis-Vectris technique represents a useful procedure for splinting maxillary teeth in selected periodontally compromised patients. The 5-year posttreatment follow-up visit showed no relapse. Correct occlusal relationships are necessary to reduce the risk of breakage.",

Control specimens did not contain fiber reinforcement. The test specimens (n=6) were either dry stored or thermocycled in water (x10.000, 5-55 degrees C) before loading (three-point bending test) according to ISO 10477 or statically loaded with a steel ball (Ø 3.0 mm) with a speed of 1.0 mm/min until fracture. A universal testing machine was used to determine the flexural properties and the load-bearing capacity. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p=0.05) and a linear regression model.\n\nRESULTS: The highest flexural strength and fracture load values were registered for specimens with 22 vol% of fibers (330 MPa and 2308 N) and with 5 mm fiber length (281 MPa and 2222 N) in dry conditions. Mechanical properties of all test specimens decreased after thermocycling.

AES depth profile analyses of the film photocatalyst testified the bilayer structure of the sample. The glass/SnO2/TiO2 film with appropriate thickness of TiO2 layer showed much higher photocatalytic activity in the case of formaldehyde photodegradation compared with glass/TiO2 film. The results could be explained by efficient interfacial charge separation via the process of electron transfer from TiO 2 to SnO2. However, when the thickness of TiO2 layer was beyond some certain value, the photocatalytic activity of glass/SnO2/TiO2 film was nearly as same as glass/TiO 2 film. The reverse glass/TiO2/SnO2 composite film did not show higher photocatalytic activity than glass/TiO2 film.

The highest tensile strength value has been obtained for an intimate mixture of both fibers, and the maximum flexural and impact strength has been obtained for composite samples prepared from interleaving layers of banana fiber and glass fiber. Tensile, flexural, and impact properties of the composites increase with an increasing volume fraction of glass fiber.

The aim of this investigation was to clarify the effects of four different kinds of fibers on the flexural properties of fiber-reinforced composites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polyethylene fiber, glass fiber and two types of carbon fibers were used for reinforcement. Seven groups of specimens, 2 x 2 x 25 mm, were prepared (n = 10 per group). Four groups of resin composite specimens were reinforced with polyethylene, glass or one type of carbon fiber. The remaining three groups served as controls, with each group comprising one brand of resin composite without any fiber. After 24-h water storage in 37 degrees C distilled water, the flexural properties of each specimen were examined with static three-point flexural test at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. RESULTS: Compared to the control without any fiber, glass and carbon fibers significantly increased the flexural strength (p &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, the polyethylene fiber decreased the flexural strength (p &lt; 0.05). Among the fibers, carbon fiber exhibited higher flexural strength than glass fiber (p &lt; 0.05). Similar trends were observed for flexural modulus and fracture energy. However, there was no significant difference in fracture energy between carbon and glass fibers (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fibers could, therefore, improve the flexural properties of resin composite and carbon fibers in longitudinal form yielded the better effects for reinforcement.",

Firstly, an equivalent constitutive relationship of laminated glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite plates has been built based on the symmetric laminated plate theory. Then, an optimization objective function of compliant adaptive wing leading edge was used to minimize the least square error (LSE) between deformed curve and desired aerodynamics shape. After that, the topology structures of wing leading edge of different glass fiber ply-orientations were obtained by using the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model and sensitivity filtering technique. The desired aerodynamics shape of compliant adaptive wing leading edge was obtained based on the proposed approach. The topology structures of wing leading edge depend on the glass fiber ply-orientation. Finally, the corresponding morphing experiment of compliant wing leading edge with composite materials was implemented, which verified the morphing capability of topology structure and illustrated the feasibility for designing compliant wing leading edge. The present paper lays the basis of ply-orientation optimization for compliant adaptive wing leading edge in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field.",

          "abstract": "In order to prepare halogen-free flame-retardant glass-fiber-reinforced poly(ethylene terephthalate) (FR-GF-PET), a novel flame retardant containing three flame-retardant elements, P, N and S, was synthesized by melt condensation reaction. Its chemical structure was characterized by FT-IR and 1H NMR spectra. FR-GF-PET was prepared by melt-mixing the flame retardant with GF-PET. The effects of the flame retardant on the flammability and thermally decomposing behaviors of GF-PET were studied via LOI, UL-94 and TGA tests. The results showed that despite a negative effect on the thermal stability of GF-PET, the incorporation of the flame retardant improved the flame retardancy of GF-PET largely. The LOI values of GF-PET increase linearly with the increase of flame retardant content. The GF-PET passed the V-0 rating in UL-94 tests when 15 wt% of the flame retardant was added to GF-PET. An interesting phenomenon was found, that is, with the increase of flame retardant content, the flame retardancy of the system increased but the char yield decreased, which was explained according to the evidences of XPS tests and the kinetics of thermally decomposing reaction. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The main objective of this study is to investigate any degradation in the tensile properties of the glass fiber-reinforced polymer bars using accelerated aging methods. Glass fiber-reinforced polymer bars were embedded in concrete prisms and exposed to several environmental conditions for 6, 12, and 18 months. The environments included exposure to tap water and seawater at two temperatures (room temperature and 50{degrees}C), seawater dry/wet cycles and alkaline solution at 50{degrees}C. In addition, two typical field conditions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Gulf area and Riyadh area) were included. The performance of the glass fiber-reinforced polymer bars was evaluated by conducting tensile tests on the bars extracted out from the concrete prisms after exposure to different conditions. In addition, scanning electron microscope was used to investigate the degradation mechanism of the bars. After 18 months of exposure, test results showed that both the tap water at 50{degrees}C and the alkaline solution at 50{degrees}C had the maximum harmful effect on the tensile strength of glass fiber-reinforced polymer bars. The two field conditions showed almost no degradation in the tensile properties of the tested bars.",

A comprehensive reliability assessment of the pultruded smart FRP rods with embedded sensors is performed, encompassing mechanical tests at room temperature as well as under conditions of low and high temperatures. In these tests, the strain output from the embedded fiber optic sensors was in good agreement with the output from surface mounted extensometers. The fatigue and short-term creep behavior of the smart composite rods is also examined. Finally, the long-term performance of the smart composites under sustained loads in alkaline environments simulating conditions encountered in concrete structures is assessed.

Methods: Sixty-three participants received 87 medium to large, cervically dentin bordered, Class II restorations of two fiber-reinforced resin composites, 42 Nulite F (N) and 45 Alert (A). The restorations were evaluated clinically, according to slightly modified USPHS criteria at baseline, after 6 months, and yearly during 6 years. Results: At 2 years the cumulative failure frequencies for N and A were 4.8% and 2.2%, respectively, which increased at 6 years to 25.0% and 12.8%. Reasons for failure were secondary caries, material and cusp fracture. The majority of the failures occurred after 3 years. Secondary caries occurred between 4 and 6 years. The incorporation of fibers resulted in very rough surface characteristics. Conclusions: A rather high failure rate was observed for one of the fiber-reinforced resin composites, while the other fulfilled the ADA criteria. The occurrence of most failures after 3 years indicated the necessity of long-term evaluations of new materials. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The visible T2 lesions are diagnostically valuable and may allow earlier diagnosis of the disease and more accurate prognostication. Quantitative MR techniques such as volume measurement can reveal pathology in nonlesional tissue with some clinical correlation; however, accurate pathological interpretation at a cellular level is problematic given the current resolution of MRI. In this update, recent studies using conventional and quantitative MR techniques are discussed and new, promising non-MRI methodologies highlighted, including retinal nerve fiber layer estimation. The role of MRI in measuring metabolic function, such as functional measures and investigating nonlocomotor symptoms such as cognition, is also discussed as are future improvements to the techniques currently employed in research studies. With increased sophistication and improved analysis of these techniques, understanding of the pathology underlying MS may increase, and objective quantification of the natural history of MS is possible.",

Newer advances include introduction of newer techniques like combined spinal epidurals, low-dose epidurals facilitating ambulation, pharmacological advances like introduction of remifentanil for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia, introduction of newer local anaesthetics and adjuvants like ropivacaine, levobupivacaine, sufentanil, clonidine and neostigmine, use of inhalational agents like sevoflourane for patient-controlled inhalational analgesia using special vaporizers, all have revolutionized the practice of pain management in labouring parturients. Technological advances like use of ultrasound to localize epidural space in difficult cases minimizes failed epidurals and introduction of novel drug delivery modalities like patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) pumps and computer-integrated drug delivery pumps have improved the overall maternal satisfaction rate and have enabled us to customize a suitable analgesic regimen for each parturient. Recent randomized controlled trials and Cochrane studies have concluded that the association of epidurals with increased caesarean section and long-term backache remains only a myth. Studies have also shown that the newer, low-dose regimes do not have a statistically significant impact on the duration of labour and breast feeding and also that these reduce the instrumental delivery rates thus improving maternal and foetal safety. Advances in medical technology like use of ultrasound for localizing epidural space have helped the clinicians to minimize the failure rates, and many novel drug delivery modalities like PCEA and computer-integrated PCEA have contributed to the overall maternal satisfaction and safety.",

Various polymer blends, where GF/PA6 acts as the polymer matrix and solid lubricants as the dispersed phase were prepared by injection molding. The tribological properties of these materials and the synergism as a result of the incorporation of both PTFE and UHMWPE were investigated. The results showed that, at a load of 40N and a velocity of 200rpm, PTFE was effective in improving the tribological capabilities of matrix material. On the contrary, UHMWPE was not conductive to maintain the structure integrity of GF/PA6 composite and harmful to the friction and wear properties. The combination of PTFE and UHMWPE showed synergism on further reducing the friction coefficient of the composites filled with either PTFE or UHMWPE only. Effects of load and velocity on tribological behavior were also discussed. To further understand the wear mechanism, the worn surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy.",

No significant influence of m-PP on composite stiffness was observed. Additional mechanical tests on unidirectional glass/PP composites with 0 wt% and 10 wt% m-PP showed only a small increase in fibre-dominated properties such as longitudinal tensile strength and strain, whereas composite properties that are governed by the interphase, such as transverse, shear and compressive strength, showed significant increases as a result of matrix modification and an enhanced interaction between the glass fibres and the PP matrix.",

Trial runs designed based on the Taguchi&#039;s orthogonal arrays are subjected to tensile, impact, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy tests; and the results are used to perform the analysis of variance (ANOVA). It is shown that the rubber particle size decreases significantly by increasing the rubber content for the unreinforced blend. The results also indicate that the composition of the compounds is the most influential factor on the phase morphology and mechanical properties of both the unreinforced and reinforced blends compared to the extrusion variables. But the processing parameters can also influence the performance characteristics slightly. The most important processing parameter, among the others, is shown to be the mixing temperature, which decreases the fiber length greatly and leads to the thermo-mechanical degradation of the polymers above 240 ??C. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

          "abstract": "One of the recent developments in composite technology in South Africa is the increasing use of natural fiber materials in the manufacture of plastic products. Most of the previous work on natural fiber-reinforced composites has focused on sisal fiber as it was commercially available. In this study, the mechanical and thermal properties of composites made with locally produced hemp fibers, were compared with composites made with hemp fibers produced in France. New commercial polypropylene random copolymer was used as matrix because it can be processed at lower temperatures when compared with other commercial propylene copolymers. The composites were produced by extrusion compounding and were further processed into tensile test bars by injection molding. Up to 30% fiber loading could be achieved. It was observed in all composites that increasing the amount of fiber resulted in an increase in tensile strength, elastic modulus, and flexural strength and a decrease in impact strength. The thermal properties of the composites were analyzed by the thermogravimetric method. It was found that the fiber/PP composites showed excellent properties when compared to fiber and the matrix separately. The addition of hemp fibers shifted the start of the degradation process towards higher temperatures. The results obtained show that the mechanical and thermal properties of South African long hemp fiber composites compare favorably well with the French bleached and unbleached hemp fibers. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",

Therefore, the method for improving bonding strength and fracture toughness for thick adhesive layer was investigated by reinforcing the adhesive layer with glass fiber mat for the robust and sustainable system design for the secondary barrier. Randomly oriented E-glass fiber mat was used as reinforcement for the film type epoxy adhesive. The lap shear strength and fracture behavior were investigated with respect to fiber volume fraction, and compared to those of the adhesive without reinforcement. The effects of repeated thermal shocks on adhesive bonding performances of adhesive joints with reinforced adhesive were also studied. The experimental results revealed that the randomly oriented glass fiber reinforcement improved much the bonding strength and fracture toughness of adhesive even with 1.0. mm thickness at the cryogenic temperature. Also it was found that the enhancement of bonding performances strongly depended on the CTE (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) differences between the stainless steel foil and reinforced adhesive. Finally an optimum volume fraction of the glass fiber reinforcement was proposed for the newly developed Al-SUS adhesively bonded joint. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

The specimens were immersed in water and exposed to steam for 4320 min to determine the water/moisture absorption and the thickness swelling as well as their rates in the composites. Results revealed that application of the glass fibers increased in the water/moisture absorption significantly in the hybrid composites due to formed micro-gaps in interfaces between wood flour and the glass fibers.

For environment concern on synthetic fiber (such as glass, carbon, ceramic gibers etc) natural fibers (such as flax, hemp, jute, kenaf) etc are widely used. Industrial hemp fiber is one of the strongest of the natural fibers available and possesses benefits such as low cost and low production energy requirements. The primary objective of this research is to fabricate the natural fiber composites with suitable processing/manufacturing methods and to examine the mechanical properties when subjected to Tension, Bending and Impact loads and to compare &amp;amp; contrast the results with the available literature. In this research work, hemp fiber reinforced polypropylene matrix composites have been developed by extrusion compounding and Injection moulding with varying process parameters, such as fiber condition(untreated and alkali treated),coupling agent(with and without compatibilizers) and different fiber percentages(10%,20% and 30% by weight). The developed composites were then characterized by tensile test, flexural test and impact testing. Results show that the tensile strength and flexural properties increases with the increase in fiber percentage. However after a certain percentage the tensile strength decreases again. Compared to untreated hemp fiber, no significant changes in the tensile strength have been observed for treated hemp fiber reinforcement. The flexural strength / modulus of the composite was higher compared to pure Polypropylene (PP) for all filler/fiber loadings.",

For this purpose a composite material sample with embedded fiber sensors is fabricated and characterized. For temperature independent local strain measurements a short length PCF modal interferometer is utilized, while for an average strain measurement a polarization maintaining PCF Sagnac interferometric sensor is used. The strain and temperature sensitivities of a buffer coated and a buffer stripped PM-PCF Sagnac fiber loop mirror sensors are measured in free space and compared to those for similar sensors embedded in the composite material. It is found that the Sagnac interferometer with an acrylate coated PCF embedded in the composite material shows the same response as the one in free space while the unbuffered PCF Sagnac interferometric sensor which is temperature insensitive in free space shows significant temperature sensitivity when embedded in the composite material sample. A fiber Bragg grating array is also embedded in the composite material for comparison of the strain and temperature measured by the PCF modal interferometers. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that PCF sensors are a feasible technology that can be adapted for composite material strain measurement. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "The impregnation of a glass woven fabric with an amorphous polyethylene terephthalate copolymer (PET-g) matrix was investigated using a finite element (FE) model for interbundle and intrabundle flow of the matrix. Micrographs of samples obtained by film stacking of PET-g to impregnate the glass fabric have confirmed the occurrence of interbundle and intrabundle flow, taking place as separate steps. On the basis of this evidence, two different mechanisms for the fiber impregnation were postulated. The first flow process is associated with a macroscale interbundle impregnation, whereas the second is associated with microscale intrabundle impregnation. Two different FE models were developed to simulate the microscopic and macroscopic flow of the matrix, considering a large number of different random fiber arrangements. Both models could account for the non-Newtonian rheological behavior of the thermoplastic matrix. The microscale impregnation of fibers was simulated by using randomly spaced and nonoverlapping unidirectional filaments. The effect of the number of filaments and the number of random distributions necessary to achieve an adequate accuracy of the method was assessed. The results obtained from the simulation showed that at low pressures, the polymer melt exhibits Newtonian behavior, which makes it possible to predict the tow permeability by the Darcy law. A more difficult situation arises at high pressures because of the non-Newtonian behavior of the melt. This requires the introduction of a value for the permeability that is also dependent on the rheological properties of the melt. The same non-Newtonian behavior of the matrix was observed for macroscale impregnation of bundles. 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Surface roughness increases with the increase of drill pre-wear due to the generated heat that assisted by the low thermal properties of polymeric composites.

Effects of additions of monoclinic celsian seeds and strontium aluminosilicate (SAS) glass on crystal phase formation during hot pressing has been investigated. On doping BAS with 5 wt.% monoclinic celsian seeds or 10 wt.% SAS, only the celsian phase was formed in hot pressed monolithic specimens.

Effect of mixing ratios of ceramic fiber and glass on the leak rates and strength of the composite seals was investigated. In addition, seal performance of commercial glasses was compared with that of SiO2-BaO-B2O3 glass synthesized in this work. The leak rate of the composite seals containing 55 vol% glass was seven times higher than the one containing 75 vol% glass. The flexural strength of the composite seals was reduced to one fourth of the initial value as the porosity increased from 1 to 29%. The incorporation of alumino-silicate chopped fibers into a sealing glass degraded room temperature strength and increased leak rates due to increase in porosity with increasing fiber content. The viscosity of glass at the seal test temperature is presumed to affect the leak rate of the glass seal.",

          "abstract": "Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has been established as a scalable and environmentally friendly approach for depositing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from aqueous colloidal dispersions onto a variety of fibrous surfaces. EPD facilitates the micro/nano hybridization of CNTs and reinforcing fibers, enabling the controlled engineering of hierarchically-structured composites. Model studies have shown that the chemistry of the CNTs in the fiber/matrix interphase plays a critical role in the mechanical performance of the composite. Composite interphases were replicated on planar glass substrates to systematically study the influence of CNT functionalization, glass surface chemistry, and aqueous dispersion quality on the mechanical performance under shear loading. CNTs were functionalized using a novel ultrasonicated-ozonolysis (USO) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) process to prepare films on silane-treated glass surfaces. The epoxy-infused films exhibited a 50% improvement as compared to untreated glass/epoxy interfaces. Detailed surface analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows chemical bonds in the interphase, and computational modeling of the valence band spectra provides additional insight into the chemical nature of the bond. The formation of a PEI-CNT rich interphase facilitates a more homogeneous, ductile fracture zone relative to the brittle glass epoxy interface, and increases composite strength by shifting the fracture surface away from the glass surface. Intentional destabilization of the CNT dispersion resulted in re-agglomeration, diminishing any benefit of the PEI, thereby demonstrating the importance of a stable dispersion provided by the USO processing. The results replicate the trends observed previously in more complex composite systems and provide new insight into interfacial engineering of nanostructured composites.",

To solve this problem, we investigated the interfacial chemistry, microstructure development, and toughness-related physical properties of CPC composites reinforced with strong fibrous materials (carbon fiber, glass fiber, and Kevlar). The most ideal interfacial structures between fiber and CPC were observed in carbon-fiber-reinforced composites, i.e., intermediate layers that were created by a moderate interfacial interaction of carbon with CPC promoted cross-linking, which tightly interconnects the fibers and thereby significantly improves ductility and toughness. In contrast, an undesirable interfacial mode was identified in Kevlar- and glass-fiber-reinforced CPC composites that were autoclaved at 250??C: the alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis of Kevlar in the composite prevented adherence to the CPC, and an extensive interaction between CPC and glass fiber resulted in the formation of porous intermediate layers. These negative factors were correlated directly to a lack of toughness and to catastrophic failure. ?? 1994.",

The thermoplast is characterized by a finite strain elastic-viscoplastic constitutive relation and the calculations are carried out using a dynamic finite element program where plane strain conditions are assumed to prevail in the direction of the thickness. Different ratios of the elongation strain and the transverse strain are studied to consider the effect of different levels of stress triaxiality and the effect of these states on the shear zone development and emerging strain and stress concentrations. Comparing a case of embedded infinitely stiff fibers to a case with glass fiber reinforcement shows little difference thus illustrating that the glass fibers act approximately as infinitely stiff. Fiber spacing and fiber width are shown to influence the shear zones and the stress fields that develop as the highly deformed region approaches the limit resulting from network stiffening in the polymer.

Previous research on commingled yarns was mainly focused on the air-jet texturing process, while the mechanical properties of the composites are strongly influenced by the impregnation homogeneity, the polymer sizing properties and consolidation process. Here, we report a unique melt spinning equipment for E-glass fiber which is compatibly combined with a melt spinning extruder to manufacture commingled yarns. The in-situ commingling enables to combine homogeneously both glass and polypropylene filament arrays in one processing step and without fiber damage compared to commingling by air texturing. Variation of processing conditions are investigated, i.e. sizings, diameter ratios, and arrangements of sizing/finish application related to intermingling of filament arrays. A rapid processing is achieved because of good intermingling and the low flow paths. We found that the sizing enables a good strand integrity with the polypropylene yarn. The interfacial adhesion can be improved with a sizing for glass fibers consisting of aminosilane and maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene film former, which results in both improved transverse tensile strength and compression shear strength. We also found that a very small amount of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in the sizing provides significantly improved interfacial adhesion strength. This is attributed to the change in fracture behavior of the nano-structured interface and morphology of the model single-fiber composites.",

Various injection molding parameters, such as filling time, melt temperature, mold temperature and ram speed were considered. The methodology combines the use of the GRA (grey relational analysis) method and a CAE flow simulation software, to simulate the injection molding process and to predict the fiber orientation. This method can replace the traditional “change-one-parameter-at-a-time” approach, which is very inefficient, costly, time consuming and almost impracticable to yield an optimum solution. At the same time, the fiber orientation was examined by CAE simulation to forecast the shear layer thickness, and simultaneously to check the accuracy of the GRA. The results indicated that three distinct layers (a frozen layer, a shear layer and a core layer) are observed from the surface to the core for various injection molding conditions. The fiber orientation is perpendicular to the melt flow direction in the frozen layer and the core layer, but it has the opposite direction in the shear layer. From the CAE analysis, the optimum process parameters to obtain the thickest shear layer are found, which is the target of the present research.",

Three types of cutting tool inserts namely, uncoated tungsten carbides, ceramic and cubic boron nitride (CBN), were used to machine two types of specimens, short (discontinuous) and long (continuous) fiber carbon epoxy composites. For short carbon fiber composites, experimental data shows that the tool wear, the surface finish and the cutting force fluctuate with respect to the depth of cut, the feed rate and the cutting speed.

          "abstract": "Recent advances have been made in our scientific understanding of how berries promote human health and prevent chronic illnesses such as some cancers, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. Cancer is rapidly overtaking heart disease as the number one killer disease in developed countries, and this phenomenon is coupled with a growing aging population and concomitant age-related diseases. Therefore, it is not surprising that consumers are turning toward foods with medicinal properties as promising dietary interventions for disease prevention and health maintenance. Among fruits, berries of all colors have emerged as champions with substantial research data supporting their abilities to positively affect multiple disease states. Apart from several essential dietary components found in berries, such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber, berries also contain numerous bioactives that provide health benefits that extend beyond basic nutrition. Berry bioactives encompass a wide diversity of phytochemicals (phytonutrients) ranging from fat-soluble/lipophilic to water-soluble/hydrophilic compounds. Recent research from laboratories across the globe has provided useful insights into the biological effects and underlying mechanisms of actions resulting from eating berries. The cluster of papers included here represents a cross section of topics discussed at the 2009 International Berry Health Benefits Symposium. Together, these papers provide valuable insight into recent research trends and advances made into evaluating the various health benefits that may result from the consumption of berries and their derived products.",

          "abstract": "Natural fibers as reinforced polymer composites have recently been the center of attention among researchers. Surface modifications and variations in the fiber diameters are major factors that influence the fiber adhesion performance inside the matrix. Experiments have been performed to further the development of natural fiber reinforced polymers as a replacement for glass fibers. In the present research, date palm fibers (DPFs) with three different size ranges of diameters (800–600, 600–400, and 400–200 μm) and the influence of alkali treatment on their characteristics have been investigated. Morphology observations (SEM), EDS density mapping (quantitative elemental analysis), X-RD, and FTIR spectroscopy of treated and untreated fibers were carried out. In addition, the tensile properties of a single fiber and composites consisting of fibers/epoxy with discontinuous random oriented short fibers both with and without chemical modification were studied. The results showed that DPFs are amenable to chemical modification particularly in the fine fiber case. It was found that the ultimate tensile strength and percentage elongation of a single fiber after alkali treatment increased by 57% and 24.7 %, respectively. Because alkali treatment of the DPFs was able to provide a good adhesion within the matrix, the tensile strength, elastic modulus and the fiber-matrix interaction of the composite were improved. Collectively, the addition of the proposed DPFs may open a new avenue for the exploitation of this natural cheap material to produce a green composite.",

These poles, made from polyester reinforced with E-glass fibers, are produced using the filament winding technique. Transmission poles are mainly subjected to cantilever bending, since loading due to the wires and wind gusts is applied laterally. In the present work, a simple, but reliable, tapered beam element is developed and the dynamic behavior of the poles is accurately captured using only a few elements. A simple model for flexible connections is established and incorporated in the analysis. The material is orthotropic and its behavior is assumed linearly elastic. Shear effects are accounted for in the analysis because of their significant role due to the low shear modulus. Modal analysis is performed for design purposes to obtain the natural frequency and period of poles with various geometrical characteristics and material lay-up, as well as the effect of connection flexibility. Experimental results on the dynamic behavior of jointed composite poles are also presented and the effect of damping is estimated.

Characterization was carried out using the mode I, double cantilever beam (DCB) and the mode II, end notched flexural (ENF) interlaminar fracture tests in order to determine the loss in crack propagation resistance. The materials used were two types of woven (2/2 Twill, 8-Harness Satin) glass fiber, and 8-Harness Satin carbon fiber. The matrix was polyetherimide (PEI). The critical values of the energy release rate in mode I and mode II were calculated using the corrected beam theory. The material reinforced with 8-Harness Satin glass fiber presented the best behavior in mode I and mode II. The decrease in fracture strength is more important in the material reinforced with carbon fiber.",

Methods: After endodontic treatment 216 human teeth received a glass-fiber post. The teeth were divided into test groups to simulate the effects of: (I) cementation material (specifically core-build-up resin or conventional luting cement), (II) pretreatment of the root dentin (none, dual-curing bonding, light-curing bonding), (III) pretreatment of the post (none, hydrofluoric acid, tribochemical pretreatment), and (IV) different regions of the root. After thermal cycling all post-cemented roots were sectioned and each specimen was loaded in a universal testing machine until failure occurred. Statistical analysis was performed by use of a mixed-effects regression model. Results: The cementation material (p ??? 0.001), the pretreatment of the post (p ??? 0.001), and the bonding of the root dentin (p ??? 0.001) had a significant effect on mean push-out strength. Statistical analysis also revealed a significant effect of root region (p ??? 0.001)-values were lower for the apical region than for the coronal third of the root. Conclusions: Enhanced retention can be achieved by use of a core-build-up resin for fiber-post cementation. Tribochemical pretreatment of the post and use of a dual-curing bonding system also increased mean push-out strength. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

These studies have generally focused on expensive materials with high quality control for use in aerospace applications. For these applications it has been economically feasible to obtain reliable statistical data. To extend this research to the analysis of composites with widespread use in civil engineering, the complicated models developed in the past need to be simplified. This paper proposes a simplified stochastic two-dimensional model to predict the strength distribution of single-ply unidirectional composites. The model is studied via Monte Carlo simulation and accounts for the following parameters: specimen size, fiber strength distribution, fiber-matrix properties and load transfer at broken fibers. The classical load sharing rules to model the load redistribution at broken fibers are modified to consider different material properties. A parametric study investigating the parameters that affect the strength and the failure pattern of the composite is presented. The numerical results are consistent with experimental data analyzed. The study is used to quantify the effect of various material and geometric characteristics on resultant performance and failure properties. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the present work, drilling tests were carried out on computer numeric control (CNC) drilling machine. The parameters considered for the drilling investigations were spindle speed, feed rate and diameter of the drill bits. Multiple regression analysis is used for the modeling of process parameters in drilling of GFRP composites. Taguchi&#039;s S/N ratio analysis and desirability-based approach are used for the optimization of process parameters for studying the delamination in drilling of GFRP composites. The results revealed that the factor feed rate and drill diameter are the most influential parameters which affects the delamination in drilling of GFRP composites.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four particulate filler composite resins (Tetric Ceram, Point 4, Z250, P60) and one continuous longitudinal glass fiber material (everStick) as reinforcement were selected. Three groups of beam specimens (5 x 5 x 25 mm) for each material were fabricated. For group I, specimens were not reinforced with fibers and were tested as the control group. For group II, specimens were reinforced with 2 layers of the fiber (6.5 vol%), and for group III with 3 layers (9.8 vol%). The specimens were stored at 37 degrees C for 30 days. One end of the beam specimen (14 mm) was fixed in a device, while the other (11 mm) was left free. Cantilever beam strength was measured using a universal testing machine, loading at a distance of 10 mm from the upright support through a steel ball of 2 mm diameter. The loads and deflection at initial failure and at final failure for each specimen were recorded. The data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and the multiple comparison Scheffé test (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: The bending moments of particulate filler composite at final failure, when reinforced with 3 layers of the glass fibers (272.4-325.2 Ncm), were significantly higher than for the composites without fibers. However, the materials reinforced with 3 layers of fibers were not significantly different from the materials reinforced with 2 layers of fibers (234.1-282.6 Ncm). The materials reinforced with 3 layers of fibers exhibited severe deflection at final failure, ranging from 2.8 mm to 3.4 mm. The bending moments of the particulate composites increased linearly with the weight fraction of the fillers, but there was no linear correlation between them when reinforced with fibers. CONCLUSIONS: The cantilever beam strength of the particulate filler composites increased significantly when layers of fibers were added and as the weight fraction of filler increased, but a higher fiber volume fraction did not lead to a significantly higher cantilever beam strength.",

          "abstract": "A model has been formulated for analyzing the influence of fiber inclination angle on its rupture load in fiber reinforced cementitious composite. As a stiff fiber is pulled with an angle to the direction of pulling, the fiber rupture load decreases compared to the case with zero inclination angles. This phenomenon is called fiber apparent strength (defined as rupture load divided by fiber cross-section area) degradation. A parametric study, including the influence of elastic moduli of fiber and matrix, fiber/matrix interfacial bond strength as well as fiber orientation in matrix on the fiber apparent strength is carried out. The model results indicate that with the increase of fiber inclination angle, fiber apparent strength decreases. In addition, fiber apparent strength degradation degree is influenced by the elastic moduli of fiber and matrix and fiber/matrix interfacial bond strength. A fiber rupture test of carbon fiber in cementitious matrix was used for model verification. Model predictions based on independent parametric input compare favorably with experimental measurements of fiber apparent strength. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

          "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the fatigue resistance, debonding force, and failure type of fiber-reinforced composite, polyethylene ribbon-reinforced, and braided stainless steel wire lingual retainers in vitro.\n\nMETHODS: Roots of human mandibular central incisors were covered with silicone, mimicking the periodontal ligament, and embedded in polymethylmethacrylate. The specimens (N = 50), with two teeth each, were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10/group) according to the retainer materials: (1) Interlig (E-glass), (2) everStick Ortho (E-glass), (3) DentaPreg Splint (S2-glass), (4) Ribbond (polyethylene), and (5) Quad Cat wire (stainless steel). After the recommended adhesive procedures, the retainers were bonded to the teeth by using flowable composite resin (Tetric Flow). The teeth were subjected to 10,00,000 cyclic loads (8 Hz, 3 - 100 N, 45° angle, under 37 ± 3℃ water) at their incisoproximal contact, and debonding forces were measured with a universal testing machine (1 mm/min crosshead speed). Failure sites were examined under a stereomicroscope (×40 magnification). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance.\n\nRESULTS: All the specimens survived the cyclic loading. Their mean debonding forces were not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05). The DentaPreg Splint group (80%) showed the highest incidence of complete adhesive debonding, followed by the Interlig group (60%). The everStick Ortho group (80%) presented predominantly partial adhesive debonding. The Quad Cat wire group (50%) presented overlying composite detachment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Cyclic loading did not cause debonding. The retainers presented similar debonding forces but different failure types. Braided stainless steel wire retainers presented the most repairable failure type.",

          "abstract": "The most popular matrix used for fiber-reinforced industrial composites is organic polymer. The nature flammability of the organic polymer matrix (Marsh, 2002), however, limits the use of these materials in ground transportation (Hathaway, 1991), submarine and ships (Demarco, 1991), and commercial aircraft (Davidovits, 1991), where restricted egress of fire hazard is an important design consideration, although traditional fibers, such as carbon and glass fibers or new developed, high temperature, thermal-oxidative stable fibers from boron, silicon carbide and ceramic are inherently fire resistant (Papakonstantinou et al., 2001). In other word, most of organic matrix composites cannot be used in applications that require more than 200 oC of temperature exposure. In these cases of applications, composites based on carbon matrix or ceramic matrices are being exploited. However, use of these materials is even strongly limited, due to high cost accompany with special and high-thermal processing requirements (Papakonstantinou et al., 2001; Papakonstantinou &amp; Balaguru 2005). In 1978, Joseph Davidovits proposed that binders could be produced by a polymeric reaction of alkaline liquids with the silicon and the aluminum in source materials of geological origin or by-product materials such as fly ash and rice husk ash (Davidovits, 1999). These binders have been coined as term geopolymers since 1979; they are inorganic polymeric materials with a chemical composition similar to zeolites but without defined crystalline structure and possessing ceramic-like features in their structures and properties. The amorphous to semi-crystalline three dimensional of sialate network consists of tetrahedral SiO4 and AlO4 which are linked alternately by sharing all the oxygens to create polymeric Si-O-Al bonds (Davidovits &amp; Sawyer 1985; Davidovits, 1991). Geopolymers are still considered as a new material for coatings and adhesives, a new binder for fiber composites, and a new cement for concrete (Davidovits, 2008). They are mineral polymers and the essence of all mineral polymers is never burn (Davidovits, 2008). Therefore, we can state that geopolymer materials are ideal for high temperature and fire applications. Fiber-reinforced composites based on geopolymer matrix (geocomposite) have been well- known for over 20 years, since the first Davidovits’ patent was filed (Davidovits et al., 1989).",

This study assessed the thickness of the oxygen inhibition layer of short-fiber-reinforced composite in comparison with conventional particulate filling composites. The effect of an oxygen inhibition layer on the shear bond strength of incrementally placed particulate filling composite layers was also evaluated. Four different restorative composites were selected: everX Posterior (a short-fiber-reinforced composite), Z250, SupremeXT, and Silorane. All composites were evaluated regarding the thickness of the oxygen inhibition layer and for shear bond strength. An equal amount of each composite was polymerized in air between two glass plates and the thickness of the oxygen inhibition layer was measured using a stereomicroscope. Cylindrical-shaped specimens were prepared for measurement of shear bond strength by placing incrementally two layers of the same composite material. Before applying the second composite layer, the first increment&#039;s bonding site was treated as follows: grinding with 1,000-grit silicon-carbide (SiC) abrasive paper, or treatment with ethanol or with water-spray. The inhibition depth was lowest (11.6 μm) for water-sprayed Silorane and greatest (22.9 μm) for the water-sprayed short-fiber-reinforced composite. The shear bond strength ranged from 5.8 MPa (ground Silorane) to 36.4 MPa (water-sprayed SupremeXT). The presence of an oxygen inhibition layer enhanced the interlayer shear bond strength of all investigated materials, but its absence resulted in cohesive and mixed failures only with the short-fiber-reinforced composite. Thus, more durable adhesion with short-fiber-reinforced composite is expected.",

The structural and surface characteristics of the carbon fiber were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), laser Raman scattering (LRS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Single fiber mechanical properties, specific surface area, composite impact properties and interfacial shear strength (ILSS) were researched to indicate the effects of surface modification on fibers and the interaction between modified fiber surface and phenolic matrix. The results showed that carbon fiber surface modification by oxidation and APS can strengthen fiber surface chemical activity and enlarge the fiber surface area as well as its roughness. When carbon fiber (CF) is oxidized treatment, the oxygen content as well as the O/C ratio will be obviously increased. Oxygen functional groups increase with oxidation time increasing. Carbon fiber treated with APS will make COR content increase and OCO content decrease due to surface reaction. Proper treatment of carbon fiber with acid and silane coupling agent prove an effective way to increase the interfacial adhesion and improve the mechanical and outdoor performance of the resulting fiber/resin composites. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

Fifteen coupon specimens were prepared to experimentally determine the tensile strength of the FRP with fibers oriented at 0??, 45??, and 90?? from the loading direction. Co-axial compression tests were conducted on the wrapped cylinders and control cylinders. The test results were compared with existing confinement models.

          "abstract": "In this paper the use of fiber optic sensors embedded into GFRP laminates for structural health monitoring of thermo-mechanical loads is presented. The proposed sensing system, consisting of two coupled fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, allows the simultaneous measurement of both temperature and strain by decoupling the change in reflected wavelength induced by temperature variations from that induced by either mechanical or apparent strain, with significant advantages either for monitoring the composite cure kinetics, as described in the accompanying paper (Part I), or for assessing the structural response to thermo-mechanical loads. Both thermal ramp and mechanical static/dynamic bending tests were performed in the laboratory on instrumented GFRP samples with 12, 18 and 24 layers. It was shown that, by combining the wavelength shift outputs of the two fiber Bragg gratings, the longitudinal material CTE coefficient can be evaluated with ± 3% accuracy. This parameter can be used to discriminate mechanical and apparent strains from the FBG reflected spectrum. Static four-point bending tests showed good agreement between values measured by the embedded strain grating and those predicted by the classical lamination theory of composite materials, being the maximum deviation within 2%. Dynamic tests performed with both sinusoidal and square wave inputs have proved the effectiveness of the proposed solution to track the strain field accurately up to 10 Hz.",

In this study, ASR expansion and properties of strength were analyzed in terms of waste glass content, glass color (brown, green), fibers (steel fiber, polypropylene fiber) and fiber content, in anticipation of reducing ASR expansion. Results showed that green waste glass was more usable than brown because its expansion was less than that of brown glass. Using the accelerated ASTM C 1260 test of waste glass, no pessimum content was found. Furthermore, when fibers and waste glass were combined, there was an effect on the reduction of expansion and strength loss due to ASR between the alkali in the cement paste and the silica in the waste glass.

However, further and long-term clinical investigation will be required to provide additional information on the survival of directly-bonded anterior fixed prosthesis made with FRC systems.",

          "abstract": "A composite material consisting of HDPE, sand and short henequen fibers has been developed and characterized. It is shown that it is possible to incorporate as high as 50% w/w filler contents to the thermoplastic resin. A central composite design (Box-Hunter) was utilized to optimize the mechanical properties of the composite materials. The independent variables under study were: (i) sand content; (ii) henequen content and (iii) processing temperature. The selected response variables were the tensile and flexural properties of the composite. The tensile strength of the HDPE-sand composite does not seem to be affected by the processing temperature, for any filler content, but the tensile modulus shows similar behavior for filler contents greater than 15% w/w. The flexural strength shows a maximum at filler content of 30% w/w while the flexural modulus increase linearly. The flexural properties are not affected appreciably by the processing temperature. For the HDPE henequen composite, the processing temperature does seem to adversely effect the tensile strength but not the tensile modulus. The flexural properties are slightly increased by the processing temperature. It is shown that fiber-matrix adhesion does play an important role in the final properties of the composite. The HDPE-sand-henequen composite shows a more complicated behavior. An increase in filler content decreases the tensile strength. Similar behavior was found with an increase in the processing temperature. The processing temperature seems to have a more pronounced effect on the tensile modulus. At low temperatures the modulus behavior is governed by the sand content, while at higher temperatures, such behavior is governed by the fiber content. The flexural properties are also affected by the processing temperature. At low temperatures and sand contents below 30% w/w, the flexural strength increases with fiber content and at higher sand contents an opposite behavior is observed. At higher processing temperatures the behavior is the same as for lower temperatures, but the flexural properties are slightly decreased. It is also shown that adhesion between fiber and matrix plays an important role on the final mechanical properties.",

Methods: After randomisation, 80 single crowns, manufactured from a newly designed polymer composite, were set in posterior teeth. Half of these received a glass-fiber framework, while half were prepared without any framework stabilisation. All polymer crowns were adhesively luted with resin cement. As the control group, 40 conventional metal-ceramic crowns were inserted with hybrid cement. Documentation included failures and other complications, as well as gingival/plaque status and aesthetic performance. Results: During the 12-month observation period, eight polymer crowns and three metal-ceramic crowns showed clinically relevant complications. The most frequent complications were root canal treatments (n = 4) and decementation (n = 4) of the crowns. A total of two crowns (one polymer crown with fiber network and one crown of the control group) had to be replaced. After 12 months, polymer crowns with glass-fiber framework exhibited significantly higher plaque accumulation (p = 0.005) and gingival index (p = 0.04) than metal-ceramic crowns, while no significant differences could be demonstrated for polymer crowns without fiber reinforcement. Postoperative sensibility and aesthetic performance did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions: Within a 12-month observation period, posterior polymer crowns with and without glass-fiber framework demonstrated acceptable stability and aesthetic performance. Polymer crowns with fiber framework showed significant higher plaque accumulation and gingival index than metal-ceramic crowns. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The roots were then randomly allocated into three groups: Ia, Ib, and II (n = 12). Flexible fiber-bundle dowels were placed in groups Ia and Ib. These were available in three fiber-bundle diameters: small (0.9 mm), medium (1.2 mm), and large (1.5 mm). These bundles were luted in the root canals with Variolink II. The differences between Ia and Ib were in the ratio of the volume of fiber-bundles to the volume of luting cement and in the mode of application. Medium fiber-bundles were placed to the end of the preparation in groups Ia and Ib; however, in group Ia, a small diameter auxiliary bundle was placed, whereas in group Ib, a large-diameter auxiliary bundle was cut axially into strips of circa 0.2-mm thickness before being sequentially overlapped in placement. Roots in group II were restored with size 2 rigid prefabricated fiber dowels and luted with the light-cured cement provided by the manufacturer. After 24 hours of storage, axial tensile forces were applied to all luted dowels progressively to failure at 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferonni test.\n\nRESULTS: The mean axial resistance forces (standard deviation [SD]) for groups Ia, Ib, and II were not statistically different at 166 (49), 157 (36), and 151 (44) N, respectively (p &gt; 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between the retention of the flexible fiber-bundle dowel system and that of the rigid prefabricated fiber dowel system. Decreasing the volume of luting cement around the flexible dowels did not have a significant effect on the axial retention of the restorations.",

The type of fiber and filler morphology, size, loading, and dispersion homogeneity influence extensively the composite&#039;s performance. In the present study, various amounts of short fiber (glass and carbon) and micro-scale particles (silicon carbide, alumina and molybdenum disulphide) were systematically introduced into thermoplastic copolyester elastomer/polytetrafluroethylene (TCE/PTFE) composite for reinforcement purpose. The influence of these fibers and fillers on the tensile, flexural, and impact properties was investigated. All composite samples were fabricated using twin-screw extruder followed by injection molding. The incorporation of short glass fiber (SGF) yielded an effective improvement in mechanical properties of TCE/PTFE composite at a fiber loading of 20 wt.%. Choosing the 20 wt.% SGF-reinforced TCE/PTFE composite, short carbon fiber and microparticles were further added in order to achieve additional improvement in the mechanical properties. In fact, synergistic effects were in the form of a further increase in hardness, tensile modulus, flexural and impact strength. Various reasons to explain these effects in terms of reinforcing mechanisms were discussed. Also, dispersion of the fiber and fillers were studied using scanning electron microscopy.",

          "abstract": "Over the past few years, the use of aircraft in what can be termed long range and/or long endurance operations has proved to be a successful use of military resources. Operations such as tactical strikes mounted from bases thousands of miles away, to the use of long endurance patrol aircraft over either the battlefield or the maritime environment demonstrate the ability now contained in the NATO operational forces. The use of military airlift to position forces where they are most needed clearly is another operation where the range and endurance of the aircraft are pivotal to the success of the operation. Technologies which improve the range and endurance of aircraft have seen considerable advances over the past ten years. Aircraft design for these features has matured considerably while the procedure of air-to-air refuelling has made global deployment and 24+ hour operations a reality. While not generally perceived as long range aircraft, the possible range and endurance of fighters (both subsonically and supersonically), V/STOL aircraft and even rotorcraft have improved considerably over the last generation of vehicle design. With the current requirements to fly farther and longer, this Symposium was conceived to summarize the latest technological advances in the various fields which in a combined manner define the range and endurance of airborne vehicles. The Symposium was divided into four specific elements: &quot;* airframe design technologies, including aerodynamics and structures, &quot;* propulsion technology, &quot;* the human factors problems associated with these types of missions and, &quot; air-to-air refuelling technologies and procedures. The Symposium was opened by two Keynote Addresses, the first by M.Gen Breeschoten of the Royal Netherlands Airforce which described a military perspective on long range and long endurance operations, and the second by Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites Inc. which described the variety of technological and human challenges involved in the record breaking flight around the world of the Voyager aircraft.",

The first condition represents the movement of the chain components without loading. In the second condition, the chain component touches and moves the load. The commercial finite element package ANSYS was used to perform the numerical analysis using a three dimensional eight-noded layered structural solid elements. Chain tensile forces were loaded through pins and chosen as 250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 N for the two conditions of chain components.

This chapter describes the chemical pathways that are used to modify plant oils and allow them to react with each other and various comonomers to form materials with useful properties. Recent advances in genetic engineering, composite science, and natural fiber development offer significant opportunities for developing new, improved materials from renewable resources that can be biodegraded or recycled, enhancing global sustainability. A wide range of high-performance, low-cost materials can be made using plant oils, natural fibers, and lignin. By selecting the fatty acid distribution function of plant oils via computer simulation and the molecular connectivity, chemical functionalization and molecular architecture can be controlled to produce linear, branched, or cross-linked polymers. These materials can be used as pressure-sensitive adhesives, elastomers, rubbers, and composite resins.",

          "abstract": "Thermal insulation plays an important role in building energy savings. Previous researchers mainly focused on the exterior building envelope insulation. However, interior building envelope insulation can also reduce the building energy consumptions by minimizing the heat transfers between adjacent zones at different temperatures, especially for the multi-zone buildings. In this research, we studied the thermal insulation performance of the glass fiber board used for interior building envelope. Firstly, a mathematical model was developed to predict the effective thermal conductivity of the glass fiber boards. Then the mathematical model was validated by the measured thermal conductivities of four sample glass fiber boards with different thicknesses. Finally, we used eQuest to simulate the heating energy consumptions of a typical residential building using central heating system and the glass fiber boards as the interior building envelope insulation. The simulations were conducted in two different climatic zones in the northern China. The simulated results indicated that there was considerable heating energy saving potential by using the glass fiber boards as the interior building envelope insulation. Nevertheless, the glass fiber boards were not suggested to be too thick, for the energy saving percentages increased slowly when the insulation thickness was above 20 mm.",

This material is expected to find its application in severe corrosive environments or where light-weight rapid construction is required. This paper presents the development of composite girders using HFRP I-beam and precast Ultra-High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) slab. UHPFRC has high strength and high ductility allowing for a reduction in the cross-sectional area and self weight of the girder. A number of full-scale flexural beam tests were conducted using different dimensions of slab and with/without epoxy bonding between the slab and HFRP I-beam. The test results suggested that the flexural stiffness of composite girders with the combined use of bolts and epoxy bonding as shear connectors is higher than those with solely bolt-connectors. Delamination failure was not observed in the compressive flange of the HFRP I-beam and the high tensile strength of CFRP in the bottom flange was effectively utilized with the addition of the UHPFRC slab on the top flange.",

          "abstract": "Knowledge of the permeability tensor in liquid composite molding is important for process optimization. Unfortunately, experimental determination of permeability is difficult and time consuming. Numerical calculation of permeability from a model reinforcement can circumvent experimentation. However, permeability predictions often rely on a model reinforcement that does not accurately mimic the actual microstructure. A rapid, nondestructive technique called optical coherence tomography (OCT) can image the microstructure of a composite in minutes. Actual microstructural information can be then used to improve the accuracy of the model and therefore the predicted permeability. Additionally, the influence on fiber volume fraction and microstructural variability on permeability can be systematically studied.In this work, binary images were generated from the low contrast OCT data through image de-noising, contrast enhancement and feature recognition. The resulting data were input to a lattice-Boltzmann model for permeability prediction. The influence of the fiber volume fraction, tow surface area, average mean free channel path, and variable microstructure are discussed in terms of their individual and synergistic effects on permeability. The calculated axial and transverse permeabilities from the images show very good agreement with the experimental values.",

Even though, the coatings containing glass flake are highly corrosion resistant, their performance is decreased due to the presence of pinholes and coating defects. It is well established that polyaniline containing coating is able to protect the pinhole defects in the coatings due to passivating ability of polyaniline. Hence a study has been made on the corrosion protection ability of steel using polyaniline-glass flake composite containing coating with 10% loading of glass flake in epoxy binder. The polyaniline glass flake composite (PGFC) was synthesized by chemical oxidation of aniline by ammonium persulphate in presence of glass flake. The corrosion protection ability of GF and PGFC containing coating on steel was found out by salt spray test and EIS test in 3% NaCl. In both the tests, the resistance value of the PGFC containing coating has remained at 108-109 ?? cm2 where as for the GF containing coating, the resistance values decreased to 105 ?? cm2. The enhanced corrosion protection ability of the PGFC containing coating is due to the passivation ability of the polyaniline present in the coating. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The aim of the investigations was to show in which way the glass-fiber content, and especially the strain rate, influence the material behavior, in this case the stress–strain behavior, the tensile strength and the fracture appearance. The strain-rate dependent material behavior is described with the phenomenological G&#039;Sell–Jonas model. It was found that a transition from isothermal to adiabatic behavior occurs and, therefore, two different regression parameter sets are necessary to describe the material behavior accurately.

Friction and wear characteristics of the WGRP composite were measured in three principal orientations, i. e., sliding directions relative to the woven glass fabric (WGF) orientations in the composites. These are longitudinal (L), transverse (T), and parallel (P) orientations. The experiments were conducted using a pin-on-disc (POD) machine under dry sliding conditions against a smooth stainless steel counterface. Results of friction coefficient and wear resistance of the composites were presented as function of normal loads (30 -100 N) and sliding distances (0.5 -7 km) at different sliding velocities, 1.7, 2.8, and 3.9 m/s. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the mechanisms of worn surfaces. Experimental results revealed that woven glass fabric improved the tribological performance of neat polyester in all three tested orientations. In L-orientation, at a low velocity of 1.7m/s, WGRP exhibited significant improvements to wear resistance of the polyester composite compared to other orientations. Meanwhile, at high velocities (2.8 and 3.9m/s), T-orientation gave higher wear resistance. SEM microphotographs showed different damage features on the worn surfaces, i. e., deformation, cracks, debonding of fiber, and microcracks.",

          "abstract": "The rapid coating of composites with absorbing paints yields materials that can absorb microwave radiation and still have approximately the same specific mass of the original composites. The use of paints with specific electromagnetic properties together with carbon-nanotube-based materials allows the production of structural materials of interest to the aeronautical industry. Thus, the objective of this study was to produce and characterize the electromagnetic properties of a material consisting of a microwave absorbing coating (carbon nanotubes and polyurethane) applied to a laminated composite made with polyphenylene sulfide and glass fiber. The attenuation of microwaves (8 to 12 GHz) incident on this material was evaluated using the waveguide technique to determine whether this material can be used as an absorbing structural material. The results show that the material absorbs up to 90% of the energy of the incident microwave, indicating that the material is an efficient absorber of microwave radiation.",

In addition, the influence of sizing on the tensile properties is also discussed by changing the amount of sizing of the glass fiber bundle. The tensile strength improved when longer periods of resin impregnation were allowed. A higher amount of sizing also improved the tensile strength by facilitating good resin impregnation into fiber bundles. Good resin impregnation suppressed matrix cracking at low strain levels, and it was the key issue to improve the tensile strength in braided fabric reinforced phenolic resin composite. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The specimen is composed of two E-glass filaments with diameters of 23 and 40 ??m, and bisphenol A type epoxy is impregnated between the filaments. The crack growth behavior under different stress ratios was investigated to clarify the fatigue crack growth mechanism. The change in the crack growth rate, da/dN, was not monotonic with crack length, suggesting a variation in the resistance to fatigue crack growth along a single filament. The resistance to fatigue crack growth of the interface is much smaller than that of composite laminates. The fatigue crack growth mechanism of the glass fiber/epoxy interface under different stress ratios is controlled by the maximum energy release rate, G max, which is completely different from that of composite laminates. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanical properties of the polymers are severely influenced by the loading rate compared with the metals. The gear rotational speed decides the loading frequency of the polymer gear tooth, which influences the temperature generated and thereby the strength of the material. Performance of polymer base gears at different gear rotational speeds is reported in this paper. Injection molded unreinforced Nylon 6 and 20% short glass fiber reinforced Nylon 6 spur gears were tested at various speeds and torque levels in a power absorption type gear test rig. Gear rotational speed affects the performance of gears made of both the materials at high running speeds and high test torques and not in low speeds and torque levels. On-line measurement of test gear surface temperature and failure analysis was done to understand the failure mechanisms. At all the investigated gear speeds, glass fiber reinforced Nylon 6 gears shows superior performance over unreinforced Nylon 6 gears due its superior mechanical strength and resistance to thermal deformation. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In relation to this, the crashworthy ability of an automotive frame rail of hour glass cross-section, made of a glass fiber/ vinylester composite and designed for use in the apron construction of the car, when subjected to axial collapse and bending, has been extensively investigated in this paper. An important problem arose, dealing with the delamination observed at the corners and curved parts of the hourglass section which may be attributed to the manufacturing processing, resulting in severe limitations in the load-carrying capacity of this structural component. The effect of the residual stress and strain fields induced during fabrication was examined both theoretically and experimentally and possible failure mechanisms observed were investigated and discussed. ?? 1995.",

Based on the equilibrium of mechanical moment between the external load and the internal bridging stresses, a novel bridging model with the compact tension geometry is presented. The application of the model to experimental R-curve results enables us to calculate the bridging load, and then easily provides the magnitude and the distribution of crack-face fiber bridging stresses.
