Analysis methods such as the linear elastic fracture mechanics, inherent flaw, point-stress, average-stress and Finite Fracture Mechanics are used to predict large damage capability. Experiments show that thin-ply non-crimp fabric laminates exhibit high resistance to propagation of large cracks and a remarked crack-bridging effect. Due to the unsuitability of existing models to capture such bridging processes, large damage capability is systematically underestimated by the traditional analysis methods. By taking into account the R-curve of the material in the Finite Fracture Mechanics analysis good predictions of the notched response of laminated plates with large through-penetration damage are obtained using only independently measured material properties; in addition, the Finite Fracture Mechanics model does not require fitting parameters or complex finite element analyses. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is possible to mitigate this inherent limitation and enlarge the design space by using thin plies. This paper presents an experimental study, using a spread tow thin ply carbon–epoxy prepreg material with a cured ply thickness of 0.03 mm, which shows that highly non-linear stress–strain behaviour can be achieved with angle-ply laminates, whilst suppressing the damage mechanisms that normally cause their premature failure. Several angles between 15° and 45° are investigated in a [ ± θ 5 ] s layup. It is shown that for all angles delaminations are suppressed, allowing considerable pseudo-ductile strains to develop. Significant fibre rotations take place, permitted by matrix plasticity, leading to a post-yield stiffening of the laminate, as the fibres reorient towards the direction of loading.",

The present method with a constant airflow through sagged fiber filaments can efficiently spread the thick tows without damaging any fibers. This method is robust and easy compared with other available thin-ply methods. The thin plies of thickness less than one-third of the conventional plies can easily be made with the tow-spreading technology. Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of tow-spread, thin-ply laminated composites. To study the thickness effect of the laminated composites, the test specimens were made with the same material and the same spread tows, but with dispersed and grouped laminations of the plies. Uniaxial tension static and fatigue loadings were applied on both unnotched and open-hole specimens. Impact and compression-after-impact tests were also conducted. From stress-strain curves, acoustic emission counts, X-ray photos, c-scan images and observation of damage modes of failed specimens, it was observed that the thin-ply laminated composites can suppress the microcracking, delamination and splitting damage for static, fatigue and impact loadings without special resin and/or 3-D reinforcements. Therefore, the laminate design can be simplified by using higher strain allowable without a progressive failure analysis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Unidirectional hybrid composites were fabricated by sandwiching various numbers of thin carbon prepreg plies between standard thickness glass prepreg plies and tested in tension. Specimens with one and two plies of thin carbon prepreg produced pseudo-ductile failure, whereas ones with three and four plies failed with unstable delamination.

            "abstract": "Thin-ply composites are rapidly gaining interest in the composite industry, not only because of the larger design possibilities that they offer, but also because of positive size effects that have been shown to improve performance in various loading conditions [1]. In this work, carbon fiber-epoxy composites of different ply thicknesses (30-300g/m2 fiber areal weight) were produced from the same batch of Toray M40JB fiber and NorthTPT TP80ep matrix to study the influence of ply thickness on the ultimate strength and on the onset of damage in lamina, laminates and components. Uniaxial tension, open-hole compression and open-hole tensile fatigue tests on quasi isotropic [45°/90°/-45°/0°]ns laminates showed very significant improvements regarding the on-set of damage, and in some cases ultimate strength, when decreasing the ply thickness. These performance improvements are the result of major changes in the damage progression and failure modes of the laminates caused by a systematic delay or near suppression of transverse cracking and delamination growth in thin-ply composites. On the component level, thin-ply laminates enabled a marked improvement for bolted-joint bearing, especially in hot-wet conditions. Under impact, the 30μm thin ply laminate exhibited a quasi-brittle failure with extensive translaminar cracking while a ply thickness of 100μm was found as optimum to minimize the projected damage area. Ply thickness scaling of transverse and in-plane shear strength was identified based on classical laminate theory and unnotched tensile tests on quasi-isotropic specimens. The empirical scaling was found to follow a linear trend over a range of ply thicknesses from 30 to 250μm. Due to the near suppression of delamination, the strength of thin-ply composites could then be modeled more effectively than thick ply composites using classical laminate theory or standard multilayer shell modeling. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

Accelerated ground simulation experiments were performed for CFRP, MWNT reinforced CFRP, thin-ply CFRP and MWNT reinforced thin-ply CFRP. The used ground simulation facility can simulate high vacuum, atomic oxygen, ultraviolet (UV) light and thermal cycling simultaneously. The aging experiment was performed for 20 h. After the aging experiment, total mass loss (TML) and tensile properties were measured. As a result, by applying thin-ply thickness and MWNT fillers, the tensile strength was improved at ground conditions. Under an LEO space environment, while thin-ply composites cannot relieve the degradation rate, the composites with MWNT can do so. Highly improved tensile strength was observed by simultaneously applying the thin-ply techniques and MWNT under both LEO aged and LEO non-aged conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Quasi-isotropic CFRP laminates were manufactured using 38 μm thick thin-ply prepregs. Impact damage inside the laminates was evaluated by using ultrasonic scanning and sectional fractography. Compression after impact strength was also evaluated. Thin-ply laminates showed 23% higher strength than standard-ply laminates. Transverse cracks decreased drastically in thin-ply laminates, and localized delamination was largely extended. Based on the discussions in our previous study and the literature, the specific ply thickness without drastic crack propagation appears to be less than or equal to 40 μm. Therefore, the thin laminates showed few and localized transverse cracks and delamination was largely propagated in the midplane. © The Author(s) 2011.",

If the reduction in plate stiffness induced by failure of plies is taken into account in the finite element model, close agreement between finite element and experimental load displacement curves from first-ply failure up to total failure may be obtained. Regarding the prediction of the first-ply failure load, it has been found that some of the phenomenological failure criteria may yield results of consistent accuracy for the laminated composite plates under consideration. Nevertheless, accurate prediction of the failure process after first-ply failure is still intractable.

This paper investigates the cured shape of several cross-ply composite shells. The cured shape of a cross-ply shell is generally cylindrical. A model is established to predict the cured shape. The model is based on the Rayleigh-Ritz energy method and considers geometric nonlinearity. Modeling and experiment show that, for certain stacking sequences, the generator of the cured shape may be orthogonal to the original generator, while other stacking sequences can lead to deeper or shallower cured shapes. The predictions of the model are very close to the results of FEM analysis and experiment. This model can be used as a guide in the manufacture of unsymmetric cross-ply laminates.",

On the other hand, it is reported that transverse cracks is suppressed in thin-ply composite laminate which is composed of thin prepreg of dozens micrometer in thickness. Additionally, it is suggested that static tensile, static compressive and CAI strengths are improved in thin-ply composite laminate. Especially in CAI test, it is reported that impact damage morphology in thin-ply laminate is different from normal thickness laminate. However, damage morphology of thin-ply laminate was observed mainly by non-destructive methods, and the effect of ply thickness on internal damage morphology of impacted laminate has not been conducted. In this study, three-dimensional damage distribution model is constructed by both non-destructive inspection and optical observation in multiple cross-sections. Based on the precise observations, the effect of thinning of ply thickness on the internal damage morphology is clarified.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this chapter is to describe the mechanics of a unidirectional ply. A ply or lamina is the most basic element of a composite material, a basic layer of unidirectional fibers in a matrix, produced when a unidirectional tape impregnated with resin is placed onto the surface of the tool, thus providing the shape of a composite part. In an actual ply, the fibers are arbitrarily distributed. The most important property of advanced composite materials is associated with the very high strength of a unidirectional ply, accompanied with relatively low density. This advantage of the material is provided mainly by the fibers. A ply can experience five types of elementary loading: tension along the fibers, tension across the fibers, in-plane shear, compression along the fibers, and compression across the fibers. Mechanical properties of composite materials depend on the processing method and parameters. To obtain the adequate material characteristics that can be used for analysis of structural elements, the specimens should be fabricated by the same processes that are used to manufacture the structural elements. This chapter also discusses the properties of unidirectional plies reinforced with fibers of a certain type–glass, carbon, and aramid. In hybrid composites, the plies can include fibers of two or may be more types. Hybrid composites provide wider opportunities to control material stiffness, strength, and cost. A promising application of these materials is associated with the thermostable structures, which do not change their dimensions under heating or cooling.",

This approach utilizes micromechanics and continuum damage mechanics to predict the overall mechanical response of composite laminates with ply cracking in multiple orientations. The material constants needed in the continuum damage mechanic formulation are calculated from stiffness property changes incurred in a reference laminate. For other laminate configurations, the stiffness changes are derived using a relative constraint parameter which is calculated from the constraint on the opening displacement of ply cracks within the given cracked laminate evaluated numerically by a finite element analysis of appropriately constructed representative unit cell. The number density of ply cracks (cracks per unit length normal to the crack planes) under quasi-static loading is calculated by an energy-based approach. Finally, the stress-strain response of a laminate is determined by combining stiffness property changes and evolution of crack number density.",

Damage mechanics is used to describe the matrix microcracking and fibre/matrix debonding. Damage variables are defined and associated with the material stiffness reduction. In order to take anelastic strains induced by damage into account, a plasticity model is built up. The behaviour differences between tension and compression in the fiber direction are treated. The model leads to a laminate failure criterion. The model-identification procedure is precisely detailed. It consists in performing three tension tests and one compression test on a laminate whose reinforcement directions are conveniently chosen.

Utilisation of this damage suppression in carbon–epoxy angle-ply laminates has been shown experimentally to yield a highly non-linear stress–strain response. This paper presents an analytical modelling method that incorporates matrix plasticity and reorientation of the fibres into a classical laminate analysis for the prediction of the in-plane response of thin ply angle-ply laminates. It is shown that the method can successfully predict the non-linear behaviour of [ ± θ 5 ] s laminates with values of θ between 15° and 45°. The main characteristics of the stress–strain curve, such as the initial largely linear region, yield point and stiffening before final failure, are all well captured. The modelling has allowed straightforward identification of a particular fibre angle that exhibits strength in excess of 900 MPa, strain to failure of more than 3.5% and a promising pseudo-ductile strain of 1.2%.",

The damage process of the UD hybrid can then be predicted based on the order of the required stress for each damage mode. Using the developed analytical method, a new series of standard-thickness glass/thin-ply carbon hybrid composites was tested and a very good pseudo-ductile tensile response with 1.0% pseudo-ductile strain and no load drop until final failure was achieved. The yield stress value for the best tested layup was more than 1130MPa.

This test allows to identify material strength and/or toughness characteristics as well as to establish relation between damage level and the composite stiffness reduction. The transverse ply cracking is an inherently stochastic process due to the random variability of local material properties of the plies. The variability affects both crack initiation (governed by the local strength) and propagation (governed by the local fracture toughness). The primary aim of the present study is elucidation of the relative importance of these phenomena in the fragmentation process at different transverse and longitudinal ply thickness ratios. The effect of the random crack distribution on the mechanical properties reduction of the laminate is also considered. Transverse ply cracking in glass fiber/epoxy cross-ply laminates of the lay-ups [02/902]s, [0/902]s, and [0/904]s is studied. Several specimens of each lay-up were subjected to uniaxial quasistatic tension to obtain crack density as a function of applied strain. Crack spacing distributions at the edge of the specimen also were determined at a predefined applied strain. Statistical model of the cracking process is derived, calibrated using crack density vs. strain data, and verified against the measured crack spacing distributions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Foremost among the differences is the characteristic damage state. [90m/0n]s laminates form antisymmetric or staggered microcracks while [0n/90m]s laminates form symmetric microcracks. To explain observed differences, this paper presents a variational mechanics analysis of the stresses and the energy release rate in a [[90m/0n]s laminate having staggered microcracks. The new analysis and a previous analysis of [0m/90n]s laminates are used to assess the effect of laminate structure on the mechanical properties and failure properties of cross-ply laminates. The findings are as follows. (1) A given level of microcracking damage causes a greater amount of degradation in mechanical properties in [[90m/0n]s laminates than in the corresponding [0n/90m]s laminates. (2) Although [[90m/0n]s laminates will initiate microcracks at lower loads, the corresponding [0n/90m]s laminates will develop more microcracks after continued loading. (3) A bending effect present in [90m/0n]s laminates but not in [0n/90m]s laminates promotes mode I delamination in [90m/0n]s laminates.",

Three basic deformation modes; namely opening up, closing-in and twisting, were observed and these depended on the winding angle, material and wall thickness. The residual stresses were also determined from hoop and axial strain gauges mounted on both the inner and outer surfaces at various locations around the tube. The stresses were compared with theoretical prediction based upon a linear thermo-elastic analysis. Both the predicted and measured values were found to increase with increasing hoop stiffness but there was a large discrepancy between the predicted and measured data, reaching a factor of 5 for the thinnest case. When compared with predicted failure stresses, the experimentally determined stresses were some 15% of the computed compressive strength.",

The objective of this paper is to establish the validity of an approximation that can be made when analysing the stress and displacement distributions in multiple-ply cross-ply laminates having arrays of non-uniformly spaced ply cracks. The approximation assumes that the stress and displacement distributions in the region between the planes containing neighbouring ply cracks are the same as those arising in an identical laminate having uniformly spaced ply cracks of the same separation. The validity of this approach is established by comparing predictions of the thermo-elastic constants of the cracked laminates generated by two distinct stress-transfer models. The first model, that generates the approximations for non-uniform ply crack spacings, is based on a stress-transfer analysis that was specifically developed for uniformly spaced ply cracks while the second model accurately takes account of the effects of the non-uniformity of ply crack spacing on the stress distribution. It is shown, following a comprehensive analysis of various laminate types and crack patterns for both carbon fibre and glass fibre systems, that the approximation suggested provides highly accurate predictions of effective thermo-elastic constants over a wide range of laminate parameter variations.",

Analyses and experiments indicate that delamination is the dominant failure mode and ply damage processes have a little effect on delamination initiation and growth.

Stress relaxation tests are performed at 100 ??C for 5 h on plain coupon specimens of three types of angle-ply laminates [??30]3S, [??45]3S and [??60] 3S under displacement controlled conditions. For each ply orientation, the stress relaxation tests are carried out at three different strain levels. Stress relaxation phenomena clearly appear in all kinds of angle-ply laminate. The average stress in the angle-ply laminates rapidly relaxes to approach a steady-state value associated with the strain sustained. The rate of stress relaxation in the angle-ply laminates substantially diminishes in the tested time range. Stress relaxation simulation of the angle-ply laminates is performed using the classical laminated plate theory and a phenomenological viscoplasticity model for individual plies. Material constants involved in the ply viscoplasticity model are identified on the basis of the off-axis creep behavior for a unidirectional laminate based on the same kind of carbon/epoxy prepregs. Excellent agreements between the predicted and observed results are obtained by taking into account a local recovery of total strain in the gauge-length part of specimens as well as a fiber rotation induced by deformation.

Energetics arguments have been presented which explain this behaviour and permit experimental ply cracking strains to be estimated. The effects of thermal strains generated during fabrication and Poisson generated strains have been assessed and included in the energetics calculations. The thermal strains were determined and found to be large in carbon fibre/epoxy laminates compared with glass fibre/epoxy laminates. Poisson effects are significant in the glass fibre/epoxy laminates due to the higher failure strain of these composites. The micro mechanics of failure were also studied and fibre debonding identified as a source of 90 degrees ply failure.",

Damage in the transverse plies was triggered by interface decohesion and matrix cracking. The simulation strategy was applied to study the influence of ply thickness on the critical stress for the cracking of the transverse plies and on the evolution of crack density in 02/90n/2s laminates, with n=1, 2, 4 and 8. It was found that the transverse ply strength corresponding to the initiation and propagation of a through-thickness crack was independent of the ply thickness and that the transverse strength of carbon/epoxy laminates was 35% higher than that of the glass fiber counterparts. In addition, the mechanisms of crack initiation and propagation through the thickness as well as of multiple matrix cracking were ascertained and the stiffness reduction in the 90° ply as a function of crack density was computed as a function of the ply thickness.",

            "abstract": "The annulus fibrosus (AF) of the intervertebral disk plays a critical role in vertebral load transmission that is heavily dependent on the microscale structure and composition of the tissue. With degeneration, both structure and composition are compromised, resulting in a loss of AF mechanical function. Numerous tissue engineering strategies have addressed the issue of AF degeneration, but few have focused on recapitulation of AF microstructure and function. One approach that allows for generation of engineered AF with appropriate (+/-)30° lamellar microstructure is the use of aligned electrospun scaffolds seeded with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and assembled into angle-ply laminates (APL). Previous work indicates that opposing lamellar orientation is necessary for development of near native uniaxial tensile properties. However, most native AF tensile loads are applied biaxially, as the disk is subjected to multi-axial loads and is constrained by its attachments to the vertebral bodies. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the biaxial mechanical response of engineered AF bilayers, and to determine the importance of opposing lamellar structure under this loading regime. Opposing bilayers, which replicate native AF structure, showed a significantly higher modulus in both testing directions compared to parallel bilayers, and reached ∼60% of native AF biaxial properties. Associated with this increase in biaxial properties, significantly less shear, and significantly higher stretch in the fiber direction, was observed. These results provide additional insight into native tissue structure-function relationships, as well as new benchmarks for engineering functional AF tissue constructs.",

A fracture mechanics approach enables the rate of crack growth to be predicted in terms of the elastic properties and dimensions of the laminate, the magnitude of the deformations and the basic crack growth characteristics of the ply rubber. The theory indicates the growth rate to be determined by the strain energy released from the central region of the laminate and to be independent of crack length once this exceeds a small value. The latter feature has been verified experimentally and the magnitudes of the observed crack growth rates are in reasonable agreement with those predicted for various deformation cycles.",

All arise from the judicious re-alignment of the principal material axis of laminate classes with Bending-Twisting and/or Bending-Extension and Twisting-Shearing coupling; where off-axis material alignment of these parent classes gives rise to distinctly different mechanical coupling behaviour. However, for standard ply angle orientations, HTCS solutions were found in only 8-, 12-, 16- and 20-ply laminates. This article considers non-standard ply angle orientations +60??, -60??, 0?? and 90??, which lead to solutions in all ply number groupings for 10 plies and above, thus offering a possibility for ply terminations and hence tapered HTCS laminate designs. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that two stable shapes still exist for laminates with larger dimensions but the two shapes are not symmetric as in traditional cross-ply laminates. The bifurcation dimension increases when the thickness of piezoelectric layer increases. Laminate curvatures are in a perfectly linear relationship with an electric field applied to the piezoelectric actuator layer.

It is shown how these models associated with the statistical description of strength or energy released in the 90° plies make it possible to describe the development of transverse cracking in monotonic or fatigue loading.

Anticlastic curvature is one example of elastic tailoring that occurs with an unsymmetric cross-ply layup. Residual stresses resulting from differences in coefficients of thermal expansion and elastic properties in each lamina can cause large out-of-plane deformations. In the case of thin unsymmetric cross-ply laminates under thermal curing load, a cylindrical shape is observed because of this inherent geometrical nonlinearity as opposed to the saddle shape that classical lamination theory predicts. In this article, a finite element approach, using ABAQUSTM, is implemented in order to predict the unsymmetric cross-ply laminate shapes under thermal curing stresses and understand the underlying limit point instability. Numerical results for curvatures of the predicted shapes are in agreement with published experimental and analytical data. The stability of the cylindrical laminates is also investigated. Depending on the aspect ratio of the rectangular laminate, a cylindrical shape may snap-through from its current stable configuration to another stable cylindrical shape with a different curvature. In particular, both the critical aspect ratio where snap-through will cease to occur and the buckling load are reported.",

The fibre-matrix interface strength was found to control transverse shear strength, while the interface fracture energy had marked effect on the strain to failure and the interaction of damage mechanisms during fracture. It was also found that regions of low fibre volume fraction, such as areas near the ply boundary, were more susceptible to yielding due to the lack of reinforcement in these regions.

            "abstract": "This paper presents a synergistic methodology to analyze damage behavior in composite laminates with transverse matrix cracks in plies of multiple orientations. The approach combines the strengths of micro-damage mechanics (MDM) and continuum damage mechanics (CDM) in predicting the stiffness degradation due to presence of transverse cracks. The micromechanics is performed on a representative unit cell using a three-dimensional finite element analysis to calculate the crack opening displacement (COD) accounting for the influence of the surrounding plies, the so-called constraint effect. This information is then incorporated in the CDM formulation dealing with laminates containing cracks in different ply orientations through a &#039;constraint parameter&#039;. In CDM, a separate damage mode is defined for each type of crack and the expressions for engineering moduli of the damaged laminate are derived in terms of crack density and the constraint parameter. The COD and stiffness degradation predictions agree well with published experimental data for [0 / ± θ4 / 01 / 2]s laminate configuration. To enable damage analysis of other configurations of [0m / ± θn / 0m / 2]s laminate, a parametric study of the CODs is performed and using the computations a master equation is developed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is based on laminated beam theory incorporating first-order shear deformation theory. Compliance and strain-energy release rate determined for relatively thin unidirectional and angle-ply laminate ENF specimens were in good agreement with a previous classical plate theory formulation. For thicker laminates, however, effects of shear deformation on the compliance of the ENF specimen become significant. An experimental study on glass/polyester quasi-unidirectional and angle-ply laminate ENF specimens was conducted. Specifically, [0]6, [??30]5 and [??45]5 laminates with mid-plane delaminations were considered. Experimental compliance data agreed well with analytical predictions. The fracture toughness increased with increased angle ?? at the ???? interface. This is attributed to the fracture work associated with the debonding of transversely oriented fiber bundles in the quasi-unidirectional plies. The angle-ply laminates displayed more yarn debonding than the quasi-unidirectional laminate. For all laminates it was observed that the crack propagated in a non-uniform manner which is correlated with elastic coupling effects with cracked regions of the laminate beams.",

The analysis is based on a three-dimensional micromechanical model that predicts the stress/strain field at the fiber and matrix levels near the free edge surface of the cross-ply laminate. The epoxy matrix is represented by a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive model. In addition, two different damage criteria for the matrix cracking and interface debonding have been introduced into the model, which were incorporated into the finite element analysis program, adina, through the user-defined subroutine. Damage initiation as well as damage growth in the cross-ply laminate is predicted by the present model. It is found that the edge effect is more dominant in the damage initiation process and its influence on the global properties of cross-ply laminate, is not significant. Under a constant load, it is possible for the damage to grow further due to the viscosity of the matrix and the stress/strain redistribution in the cross-ply laminate.",

The dissipated energy is correlated to the crack density growth data recorded for a reference laminate. The critical strain energy release rate, Gc obtained in this way is increasing with the applied strain. This phenomenon reflects the statistical nature of Gc distribution in the 90-layer: the first cracks (lower strain) develop in positions with lower fracture toughness. The obtained Gc data are in a good agreement with fracture toughness data obtained using LEFM based “compliance calibration” model in which the stiffness change with increasing strain is used. Finally, the matrix cracking development is successfully simulated using in the LEFM model, the data for critical strain energy release rate and an earlier derived stiffness–crack density relationship. It has been demonstrated that knowing the laminates geometry and measuring the laminate stiffness reduction with strain or (alternatively measuring the dissipated energy) the damage evolution may be simulated, thus reducing the necessity for optical observations to validation only.",

            "abstract": "This article describes the application to a range of laminates of a recently developed homogenisation technique for general symmetric laminates that enables progressive ply cracking to be predicted in a laminate containing any number of plies having a variety of orientations. The energy-based methodology may be applied in conjunction with a strain-based fibre failure criterion to predict progressive ply crack formation and the strength of the laminate for situations where the laminate is subject to general in-plane loading and thermal residual stresses. The comparison of model performance with some experimental results for uniaxial loading described in the literature, for a range of laminate geometries without 0?? plies, indicates that the model correctly takes account of the effects of varying ply thicknesses. The predicted maximum stress applied during a ply cracking simulation can be a very good estimate of the laminate strength when ply cracking is the principal mode of damage, i.e. delamination is minimal. The comparison of model performance with experimental results in the literature, for quasi-isotropic laminates with 0?? plies having four different lay-ups, shows there is good agreement. The model indicates that there is a ply lay-up effect, and that fibre fracture occurs at the point of laminate failure. It is shown that by placing 90?? plies adjacent to the mid-plane of the laminate, the strength of the laminate is slightly reduced. Crown Copyright ?? 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed damage model is based on damage mechanisms observed at the ply level and hypotheses regarding their effect on material stiffness. Focusing on matrix dominated failure modes, the damage behavior is split into two contributions, damage evolution and damage effect. The prior describes the progression of damage as a function of load, while the latter predicts the effect of this damage by a fourth order tensor relation as function of the current failure mode and stress state. The model relies on six material parameters, whose identification by standard tests is addressed. By combining the damage model with classical lamination theory, the behavior of laminates under plane stress loading is predicted.

Stitch cracks appear to form instead of interply delamination at the tip of the crack in the constrained ply, more typical of cross ply laminates, when the included angle is greater than 50{degrees}. Stitch cracks do not require fatigue loading to form, but appear due to thermal residual stress and monotonic loading. Stitch cracks were observed to instantly form in -. {degrees} constraint plies next to a cracked 90{degrees} ply, apparently when the included angle of the plies was less than about 50{degrees}. In addition, they formed in -15{degrees} and -60{degrees} plies next to corresponding cracked +. {degrees} surface plies. Data on stitch crack length and spacing is included. This paper seeks to raise awareness of stitch cracks by systematically demonstrating that they not only exist, but occur in awide variety of laminates. The data suggest that stitch cracks should not be overlooked during development of composite damage mechanics models.",

The crack interface was chosen to be 0°/45° and the effort was mainly focused on obtaining the mode I fracture toughness (GIC). The widely used DCB test was avoided due to anticipated problems with intralaminar damage developing at the ply interface of interest. The ADCB and AMMF methods were used to determine the mixed-mode fracture toughness with the largest amount of mode I. The selected stacking sequence resulted in desirable crack propagation behavior; there was no change of delamination plane, an acceptable crack front profile, no initial specimen curvature, and no energy dissipation through global specimen damage.

Two different fracture modes were observed: interlaminar and intralaminar. In the interlaminar fracture mode, crack jumps in the space between two neighbouring 0° and 90° plies were observed. With the interlaminar fracture mode, during crack initiation G&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt; decreased with crack length.

In addition, we confirmed the effect of stiffness of adjacent layers. In the case where the 90{degrees} layer was sandwiched between 45{degrees} layers, which had lower stiffness than the 0{degrees} layers, crack propagation in the 90{degrees} layer was faster than that observed with the 0{degrees} adjacent layers. Thus, the crack propagation behavior in the 90{degrees} layer was significantly influenced by the change in the stiffness caused by the orientation angle of the adjacent layers.",

Simple bending theory is used in conjunction with a shear-lag analysis, to calculate the degraded longitudinal modulus of a cracked transverse ply, enabling the flexural modulus of the laminate to be determined. The solution is shown to agree well with a more sophisticated stress transfer model in the literature. The analysis is then extended to calculate the applied bending moment at transverse crack onset under flexural loading using a fracture mechanics approach. The results suggest that the in situ transverse ply stress at which matrix cracking commences for the beam loaded in flexure is very close to the stress level at which the same ply would crack if the laminate were loaded in tension.",

The material was formed by dispersing single-wall carbon nanotubes in a solvent and then solution casting a thin paper using a mold and vacuum oven. In order to take advantage of the high elastic modulus of carbon nanotubes for actuation, epoxy as a chemically inert polymer is considered. An epoxy layer was cast on the surface of the nanotube paper to make a two-layer ply. A wet electrochemical actuator was formed by placing the nanotube epoxy ply in a 2 M NaCl electrolyte solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were carried out to characterize the electrochemical properties of the actuator. The voltage-current relationship and power to drive the actuator material were also determined. Compared to previous single-wall carbon nanotube buckypaper tape actuators, which had poor adhesion between the nanotubes and tape, and other nanotube-thermal plastic polymer actuators, which could not provide high strength, the epoxy based actuator has a higher elastic modulus and strength, which will be useful for future structural applications. This demonstrates that a polymer layer can reinforce nanotube paper, which is an important step in building a new structural material that actuates. Further work is under way to develop a solid electrolyte to allow dry actuation. Finally, these actuator plies will be laminated to build a carbon nanocomposite material. This smart structural material will have potential applications that range from use in robotic surgical tools to use as structures that change shape.",

Most papers which have dealt with the warping of unsymmetric thin laminated composites assumed the in-plane shear strain to be negligible. However, inplane shear strain exists in certain cases for orthotropic laminates. This paper presents a new formulation including in-plane shear strain. Present results indicate that thermal residual shear strain is negligible in cases where width-to-thickness is very large or small. However, a significant amount of shear strain exists in the range of medium width-to-thickness ratio where a bifurcation point occurs. This paper investigates the effects of width-to-thickness, aspect ratio, number of layers, and stacking sequence on the shapes of the unsymmetric cross-play [0n/90n]T (n = 1,2…) family of laminates. Curvatures are calculated for square and rectangular laminates as using the nonlinear Newton-Raphson iteration method numerically. In some cases, numerical results are compared with experiments.",

The effects of residual stresses arising from thermal expansion mismatch are taken into account. The paper extends an existing stress transfer model so that the effect of through-thickness loading can be considered. The second step is the extension of an existing framework for the formulation of criteria that can be used to predict the progressive formation of ply cracks during complex loading. The effective stress/strain relations for a damaged laminate are shown to be identical in form to those of an undamaged laminate. By considering ply crack closure conditions, a series of very useful inter-relationships between thermo-elastic constants for damaged and corresponding undamaged laminates are derived. In particular, it is shown that a single damage dependent function controls the dependence of all thermo-elastic constants on the state of ply cracking. This function has been determined from stress transfer analysis for the special case of uniform ply crack distributions having a single orientation. The inter-relationships between thermoelastic constants enable the derivation of crack formation criteria that are relatively simple in form.",

Assuming a rigid-plastic material and using the condition of kinematic continuity on the boundaries between rigid and deformable zones, a basic folding mechanism is constructed. This mechanism closely reproduces all the main features of folds and wrinkles actually observed on typical crumpled sheet metal structures. Calculations based on the energy balance postulate show that two- thirds of the plastic energy is always dissipated through inextensional deformations at stationary and moving plastic hinge lines. The extensional deformations are confined to relatively small sections of the shell surface but they account for the remaining one-third of the dissipated energy. The theory is illustrated by ap- plication to the problem of progressive folding of thin-walled rectangular columns. A good correlation is obtained with existing experimental data as far as the mean crushing force and the geometry of the local collapse mode is concern",

We find that a critical number of filaments are needed to generate net filopodial growth. Without external influences, the filopodium can extend indefinitely up to the buckling length of the F-actin bundle. Dynamical calculations show that the protrusion speed is enhanced by the thermal fluctuations of the membrane; a filament bundle encased in a flexible membrane grows much faster. The protrusion speed depends directly on the number and spatial arrangement of the filaments in the bundle and whether the filaments are tethered to the membrane. Filopodia also attract each other through distortions of the membrane. Spatially close filopodia will merge to form a larger one.

Glancing angle deposition (GLAD) and substrate motion were employed to “sculpt” columnar thin film microstructure into desired forms ranging from zigzag shaped to helical to four-sided “square” helical. Computer control of substrate motion was used to accurately position the substrate and to achieve the desired film structures. The growth mechanics of this novel thin film deposition technique are investigated with density measurements, scanning electron microscopy analysis, and measurements of effective refractive index. Adatom diffusion and atomic shadowing are the dominant growth mechanisms with glancing angle deposition conditions creating extreme shadowing. With controlled rotation of the substrate about two axes during deposition, a dense capping layer can be produced on top of the porous sculptured films. The success of the capping process was found to be strongly dependent on the technique used, with an exponential decrease (θ∝[1-A∙eB∙t]) with time of incident flux angle found to be the best to reduce filling of the porous film and fracturing of the capping film.

For instance, adding 10wt% PIP in the amine reactant solution resulted in a 6-fold increase in permeation flux, while a 91.6% MgCl2 rejection was maintained. In addition, 2-ply polyamide membranes were also prepared by two cycles of PEI–TMC and PIP–TMC interfacial reactions separately, and they showed a higher rejection than the single-ply polyamide membrane. At a low PIP/PEI concentration ratio, the single-ply polyamide membranes formed with mixed amines of PIP and PEI tended to be more permeable than the 2-ply polyamide membranes. However, it was demonstrated that by properly controlling the PIP/PEI concentration ratio, the 2-ply polyamide membranes with both a higher permeation flux and salt rejection than conventional single-ply polyamide membranes could be produced. The resulting membranes were characterized for chemical composition, surface hydrophilicity, surface charge and morphology of the polyamide skin layer.",

Further, the numerical results are employed to develop a functional continuum representation of stiffness degradation as a function of the damage parameters and fiber volume fraction perturbations.

A micromechanical approach using unit cells of square and hexagonal arrays was employed to compute the micro stresses of constituents and at the fiber--matrix interface, which were used to determine the failure initiation of a unidirectional ply. The constituent properties include two tensile and compressive strengths of fiber and matrix, plus normal and shear strengths at the interface. The matrix and interfacial dominated strength properties are determined by matching the micro stresses at the constituent levels with the observed transverse tensile and compressive strengths on the macro ply level. The longitudinal shear failure is then expected to be a result of damage progression after initial failure. Based on the current MMF, in the graphite/epoxy considered in this study both transverse tensile and compressive failure are expected to occur via matrix failure. However, in the glass/epoxy the transverse tensile and compressive failures are respectively caused by matrix failure and interfacial tensile failure. These predictions are compared with predictions from other widely used failure criteria as well as experimental data. Lastly, we predicted the failure of laminates. Instead of using a unidirectional ply-based failure theory, starting with the fiber, matrix, and their interface will lead to a much simpler, more generic theory.",

All these characteristics are incorporated into an analytical model of a perfectly plastic wedge, underlain by a weak basal layer and yielding in compressive flow. The model is sufficiently flexible to be applied to a variety of tectonic situations. In each situation the model shows that shortening of the wedge and sliding over its base can occur for reasonable values of the yield stress of the wedge and of the weak basal layer, of the surface topographic slope, of the back slope of the basal layer, and of the thickness of the wedge. The present model differs markedly from the conventional concept of gravity gliding in that it shows that horizontal compressive stresses can play a major role in overcoming the resistance to basal sliding. In addition, the model suggests that the topographic slope, when necessary, can be a result of the compression within the wedge itself; no additional outside agency for producing the topographic slope need be postulated. Thus, the model suggests that a surface topographic slope is in general neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the formation of a thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt.",

After describing the steps and procedures involved in performing the GBT cross-section analysis of an arbitrarily branched composite (laminate plate) thin-walled member, the paper addresses the numerical implementation of the proposed GBT formulation, carried out by means of the finite element method (GBT-based beam element) – particular attention is devoted to the derivation of the element linear and geometric stiffness matrices, which incorporate all the material coupling effects. In order to illustrate the application and capabilities of the proposed formulation and implementation, several numerical results are presented and discussed, dealing with the local and global buckling behaviour of FRP composite I-section columns with different ply orientations and stacking sequences. Taking advantage of the GBT modal features, deep insight is acquired on the complex composite member buckling mechanics, namely those involving bending–torsion or global–local coupling effects. In particular, one investigates the influence of (i) the constitutive assumption regarding the transverse extension occurring in the cross-section composite walls and (ii) the distribution of pre-buckling normal stresses (due to axial compression) on the buckling behaviour of I-section columns. For validation purposes, the above results are compared with values recently reported in the literature and estimates obtained from shell finite element analyses.",

            "abstract": "Delamination of prestressed thin films on thick substrates is analysed accounting for plastic dissipation in either the substrate or film. Emphasis is on large scale yielding wherein the height of the plastic zone at the propagating interface crack tip is comparable to the film thickness. Such conditions are common for both metal and polymer thin films on elastic substrates or for ceramic coatings on metal substrates when the interface between the film and substrate is reasonably strong. Under large scale yielding, the notion of a thickness-independent interface toughness no longer pertains, and a nonlinear fracture mechanics is required to quantify delamination. Two such approaches are pursued in this paper using models based on the attainment of critical conditions at the interface crack tip within the plastic zone. Steady-stale film delamination is analysed for conditions where yielding occurs either in the film or in the substrate, and critical combinations of prestress and thickness are predicted. The theory is applied to a recent set of experiments on copper films delaminating from silica substrates. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

            "abstract": "Despite their seemingly delicate appearance, thin biological membranes fulfill various crucial roles in the human body and can sustain substantial mechanical loads. Unlike engineering structures, biological membranes are able to grow and adapt to changes in their mechanical environment. Finite element modeling of biological growth holds the potential to better understand the interplay of membrane form and function and to reliably predict the effects of disease or medical intervention. However, standard continuum elements typically fail to represent thin biological membranes efficiently, accurately, and robustly. Moreover, continuum models are typically cumbersome to generate from surface-based medical imaging data. Here we propose a computational model for finite membrane growth using a classical midsurface representation compatible with standard shell elements. By assuming elastic incompressibility and membrane-only growth, the model a priori satisfies the zero-normal stress condition. To demonstrate its modular nature, we implement the membrane growth model into the general-purpose non-linear finite element package Abaqus/Standard using the concept of user subroutines. To probe efficiently and robustness, we simulate selected benchmark examples of growing biological membranes under different loading conditions. To demonstrate the clinical potential, we simulate the functional adaptation of a heart valve leaflet in ischemic cardiomyopathy. We believe that our novel approach will be widely applicable to simulate the adaptive chronic growth of thin biological structures including skin membranes, mucous membranes, fetal membranes, tympanic membranes, corneoscleral membranes, and heart valve membranes. Ultimately, our model can be used to identify diseased states, predict disease evolution, and guide the design of interventional or pharmaceutic therapies to arrest or revert disease progression. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

In the Microwedge Indentation Test (MWIT), a symmetric wedge-shaped probe extends fully across a wide thin film interconnect line, so that analysis under the assumption of plane strain is appropriate. As the indentation proceeds, an interfacial crack between the interconnect line and the substrate develops if the interface is weak. From this, adhesion can be calculated. Eventually, the interfacial crack becomes long enough that buckling ensues, giving rise to large thin film bending strains. Consequently the phase angle changes continuously from 53 to −37°. Depending on whether spallation occurs by fracture in the center of the beam or at the end of the beam at the interfacial crack tip, a thin film critical bending strain or grain boundary fracture toughness may be determined.",

            "abstract": "Composite laminate structures can be designed for specific purposes by optimizing the number of plies and the ply orientations. Previous studies established the behavior of the first natural frequencies of the bending motion of a thin composite plate in the framework of classical plate theory for different boundary conditions. Since plates can also undergo in-plane vibration, the present study is aimed at investigating the effect of the ply orientation on such in-plane vibration. This is made possible through theoretical simulation with a model based on the Rayleigh-Ritz formulation in conjunction with Hamilton principle. The total matrices deduced by minimizing the Hamilton function exhibit a decoupling of bending and membrane motions, which are in plane. The natural frequencies of the membrane motion can therefore be calculated and the ply orientations are investigated for free-free boundary conditions for a square plate. The present model is first validated by comparing the natural frequencies of the bending and in-plane motions of isotropic plates with available data in the literature and the agreement is found to be excellent with the maximum discrepancy being only 0.25%. The validation is then extended to orthotropic plates for the first two bending natural frequencies under simply supported boundary conditions for different ply orientations. The present study establishes that for free-free boundary conditions the first natural frequency of the in-plane vibration of a composite square plate is symmetrical with respect to 45{ring operator} ply orientation and is maximum for this value. This study suggests that it is possible to use this analysis to design composite plates by properly tailoring ply orientations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

A series of models, beginning with the deformation of a thick uniform layer above a thin weak layer on a fi xed base, sequentially illustrates the effects of including fl exural isostatic subsidence, strain-softening, multiple layers of strong and very weak materials, and fi nally erosion and sedimentation. These continuum models develop thin shear zones containing highly sheared material that approximate fault zones. The corresponding structures are similar to those in fold-and-thrust belts and include: far-traveled thrust sheets, irregular-roof and smooth-roof duplexes, back thrusts, pop-ups, detachment folds, fault-bend folds, break thrusts, and piggyback basins. These structures can develop in-sequence or out-of-sequence, remain active for extended periods, or be reactivated. At the largest scale, the scale of the wedge, the fi nite-element model results agree with critical wedge solutions, but geometries differ at the sub-wedge scale because the models contain internal structures not predicted by the critical wedge stress analy- sis. These structures are a consequence of: (1) the complete solution of the govern- ing equations (as opposed to a solution assuming a stress state that is everywhere at yield), (2) the initial fi nite-thickness layers, (3) the spatial and temporal variations of internal and basal strength, and (4) the coupling between surface processes and deformation of the wedge. The structural styles produced in models involving feed- back with surface processes (erosion and sedimentation) are very similar to those mapped in the foothills of the southern Canadian Rockies and elsewhere. Although syndeformational sediments have been removed by postorogenic erosion across the foothills belt, evidence of the interaction between surface processes and deformation is preserved in the structural style.",

This paper describes a series of ex perimental results on a wide variety of composite material systems and of cross-ply layups of generic type [0m,/90n]s. The variational mechanics energy release rate analysis can be used to predict all features of the experimental results and to draw some new conclusions about the progression of damage in cross-ply laminates. The recommended experiments are to measure the density of microcracks as a function of applied stress. Such results can be fit with the energy release rate expression and used to measure the microcracking or intralaminar fracture toughness. The measured microcracking fracture toughnesses are: Hercules AS4/3501-6-240 J/m2, Fiberite 934/T300—690 J/m2, DuPont Avimid® K Polymer/IM6-960 J/m2, Fiberite 977-2/T300-1800 to 2400 J/m2, and ICI PEEK/AS4- 3000 J/m2.

Morphologies were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. Four morphologies were identified, including core-shell hexagonal, core-shell double gyroid, three-domain lamellae, and core-shell inverse-hexagonal, in order of increasing O + oxide volume fraction. All of the resulting nanocomposites had three- or five-ply morphologies containing domains that were continuous in one, two, or three dimensions. The five-ply core-shell double gyroid phase was only found to be stable when the 0 + oxide domain was a minority. Removal of the polymer enabled simple and direct synthesis of mesoporous oxide materials while retaining the ordered network structure.

Despite many attempts to engineer a replacement for ailing and degenerated discs, no prior study has replicated the multiscale hierarchical architecture of the native disc, and very few have assessed the mechanical function of formed neo-tissues.\n\nMETHODS: A new algorithm for the construction of a disc analogue was developed, using agarose to form a central nucleus pulposus (NP) and oriented electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds to form the anulus fibrosus region (AF). Bovine MSCs were seeded into both regions and biochemical, histologic, and mechanical maturation were evaluated with in vitro culture.\n\nRESULTS: We show that mechanical testing in compression and torsion, loading methods commonly used to assess disc mechanics, reveal equilibrium and time-dependent behaviors that are qualitatively similar to native tissue, although lesser in magnitude. Further, we demonstrate that cells seeded into both AF and NP regions adopt distinct morphologies that mirror those seen in native tissue, and that, in the AF region, this ordered community of cells deposit matrix that is organized in an angle-ply configuration. Finally, constructs demonstrate functional development with long-term in vitro culture.\n\nCONCLUSION: These findings provide a new approach for disc tissue engineering that replicates multi-scale form and function of the intervertebral disc, providing a foundation from which to build a multi-scale, biologic, anatomically and hierarchically relevant composite disc analogue for eventual disc replacement.",

            "abstract": "In aeronautical structures, assemblies with thin laminates are becoming increasingly usual, especially for fuselage design. In these structures, out-of-plane loads can appear in bolted joints and can lead to progressive punching of the fastener&#039;s head in the laminate resulting, in some cases, in a failure mode called pull-through . [1]. This complex phenomenon, which occurs in assemblies, was studied firstly by using a simplified &quot; circular&quot; pull-through test method. Qualitative micrographic examinations showed damage very similar to that observed in impacted specimens. The research presented here extends the Discrete Ply Model Method (DPM) developed by Bouvet et al. . [2] to this case. The finite elements model is based on a particular mesh taking ply orientations into account. Cohesive elements are placed at the interfaces between solid elements to represent matrix cracks and delamination, thus allowing the natural coupling between these two damage modes to be represented. The model shows good correlation with test results, in terms of load/displacement curve, and correct prediction of the damage map until failure, including the splitting phenomenon. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",

We study here the crack formation on the free edge of CFRP cross-ply laminates experimentally and by numerical stress and failure analysis. The free-edge surface strains are measured by the digital image correlation (DIC) technique. The numerical analysis consists of a two-scale approach, where the macro-level analysis is performed with a three-dimensional finite-element method (3D FEM) and the micro-level analysis uses a periodic unit-cell (PUC) in the transverse plies. The constitutive assumption made for the macro-level analysis is an orthotropic linear thermo-elastic solid for the unidirectional plies with a thin isotropic viscoplastic layer between the longitudinal and transverse plies. In the PUC, the fibers are assumed linear elastic, while the matrix is modeled as an elastic–viscoplastic solid. Crack formation is assumed to occur in the matrix by the dilatation induced brittle failure mechanism for which the dilatation energy density criterion is used.",

Fracture of tiny systems with a given geometry and type of loading occurs at &#039;quantized&#039; stresses that are well predicted by QFM: strengths predicted by QFM are compared with experimental results on carbon nanotubes, beta-SiC nanorods, alpha-Si3N4 whiskers, and polysilicon thin films; and also with molecular mechanics/dynamics simulation of fracture of carbon nanotubes and graphene with cracks and holes, and statistical mechanics-based simulations on fracture of two-dimensional spring networks. QFM is self-consistent, agreeing to first-order with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), and to second-order with non-linear fracture mechanics (NLFM). For vanishing crack length QFM predicts a finite ideal strength in agreement with Orowan&#039;s prediction. In contrast to LEFM, QFM has no restrictions on treating defect size and shape.

A precise methodology that combines in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) surface measurements of uniaxially tension-loaded MEMS specimens and strain analysis via digital image correlation (DIC) achieving 0.1 pixel spatial displacement resolution is presented. By this method, the mechanical deformation of thin films was obtained in areas as small as 4 &amp;times; 4 &amp;mu;m and with 1-2 nm spatial displacement resolution supporting the derivation of interrelations between the material microstructure and the local mechanical properties. This methodology provided for the first time the values of Young&#039;s modulus and Poisson&#039;s ratio from specimens with cross-sections as small as 2 &amp;times; 6 &amp;mu;m. The value of properties derived via AFM/DIC demonstrated very limited scatter compared to indirect mechanical property measurement methods. The application of this technique on nonuniform geometries resolved nanoscale displacement and strain fields in the vicinity of ultrasharp elliptical perforations achieving very good agreement with finite element models. Furthermore, the stochastic and deterministic material failure properties described via Weibull statistics and fracture toughness, respectively, are illustrated for brittle thin films. Failure initiated at notches was found to be influenced by the local radius of curvature and the stress concentration factor. Precise fracture toughness values for MEMS materials were obtained from MEMS specimens with atomically sharp cracks. These studies were supported by measurements of displacements/strains conducted for the first time in the vicinity of mathematically sharp cracks via the AFM/DIC method. The method can be applied to a variety of thermomechanical reliability problems in multilayered thin films and inhomogeneous/anisotropic materials.",

Results showed that this replacement improved axial ultimate tensile strength as compared with the angle-ply reference. The three directional specimens with the hoop layers failed gradually at stress levels beyond the predicted first ply failure (FPF) as compared with angle-ply references whose behavior was highly affected and became nonlinear above FPF. Analytical prediction for elastic behavior and strength as functions of fiber orientation agreed well with experimental trends and demonstrated the advantage of three directional configuration as compared with angle-ply tube.

            "abstract": "There has recently been an increased interest in the mechanical properties of thin films, owing to their importance in electronic packaging applications. A review of some of the failure mechanisms associated with these films are presented in this paper. Films may fail by a number of different mechanisms depending upon the geometry and the stresses in the film. These include buckling, &quot;mud-cracking&quot;, and/or delamination. A complete understanding of film failure requires consideration of the forces that drive crack growth, those that resist it, and an appreciation of what determines the mode of failure. Some of these aspects are explored in this paper by a discussion of the decohesion of tensile films from a brittle substrate. Although failure may occur by delamination of the interface, often it is the substrate that cracks, rather than the interface: the stresses in the film tend to drive the crack into the substrate. This tendency may be counteracted, however, ifa weak interface makes it energetically favourable for failure to occur at the interface. As well as influencing the preferred crack trajectory, the stresses may also influence the apparent fracture toughness of the interface. This is considered in the last section of this paper and is illustrated by a discussion of some model experiments.",

The resulting relationships governing crack formation are exceedingly simple in form involving parameters that may be defined and measured at the macroscopic laminate level, thus offering engineering methods that have great potential for use in design. The methods are then applied to the prediction of transverse cracking in a specific glass-reinforced plastic system for the case of the uniaxial loading of a [0/90]s GRP laminate, and for the equi-biaxial loading of a [??45]s laminate.",

The investigation, which focussed on two classes of cross-ply stacking sequences ([03/903]s and [0/90]3s), showed that the role of stitches in controlling damage progression of laminates and their capability to reduce the impact sensitivity of specimens are greatly dependent on the impact behaviour of base (unstitched) laminates. In [03/903]s laminates, in particular, stitching is able to reduce damage area, on condition that the impact energy is higher than a threshold level and delaminations are sufficiently developed. In [0/90]3s laminates, on the other hand, stress concentration regions generated by the stitching process appear to promote the initiation and propagation of fibre fractures, thereby inducing a decrease in the penetration resistance of the laminate. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

            "abstract": "This paper addresses the distortional kinematics and mechanics of thin-walled sections and provides clear definitions of cross-section properties that characterise the distortional deformation, as it is usually done for conventional modes (axial, bending and torsion). In particular, a procedure to build the distortional displacement field of a given thin-walled section is described. The first part of the paper describes the essentials of distortion in comparison with the conventional modes of classical beam theories. It is shown that primary warping is the key factor that controls the distortion of thin-walled sections. Then, an analytical procedure to determine the distortional warping displacement distribution of a given cross-section is described, on the basis of orthogonality conditions existing between the distortional and conventional modes. Next, an overview of the kinematical assumptions underlying the distortional deformation is presented and a simple procedure to build distortional displacement fields of thin-walled sections is provided. This procedure is then applied to obtain the distortional displacement field of C-sections and general expressions of distortional cross-section properties are given. Finally, a simple example is presented to illustrate how the distortional displacement field of a C-section is built, on the basis of simple kinematics principles. The distortional critical stress and half wavelength are determined and good agreement with exact numerical estimates is found.",

Limitations of continuum representations of intra-ply damage and the effect of mesh orientation on the analysis predictions are discussed. It is shown that accurate prediction of matrix crack paths and stress redistribution after cracking requires a mesh aligned with the fiber orientation. Based on these results, an aligned mesh is proposed for analysis of the open-hole tension specimens consisting of different meshes within the individual plies, such that the element edges are aligned with the ply fiber direction. The modeling approach is assessed by comparison of analysis predictions to experimental data for specimen configurations in which failure is dominated by complex interactions between matrix cracks and delaminations. It is shown that the different failure mechanisms observed in the tests are well predicted. In addition, the modeling approach is demonstrated to predict proper trends in the effect of scaling on strength and failure mechanisms of quasi-isotropic open-hole tension laminates.",

We investigated the deformation of symmetrical cross-ply laminates under hot and humid conditions. In spite of the symmetrically stacked laminates, unpredictable out-of-plane deformation occurred over time due to ply angle misalignment. The deformation was unstable and disproportionate to the absorbed moisture. A Monte Carlo simulation based on laminate theory was performed to quantify the deformation induced by the ply angle misalignment. Symmetrical cross-ply laminates were found to twist as they absorbed water when they underwent ply angle misalignments. By comparing the analytical results with experimental results, we concluded that a standard deviation of approximately 0.4?? exists as ply angle misalignment in the laminates used in this study and that this slight ply angle misalignment can be a significant factor in out-of-plane deformation of cross-ply laminates. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

Composite materials have extensively been used in engineering problems. Quasi-brittle materials including concrete, cement pastes, rock, soil, etc. all benefit from these developments. Layered materials and especially thin film/substrate systems are becoming important in small volume systems used in micro and nanoelectromechancial systems (MEMS and NEMS). Nanostructured materials are being introduced in our every day life. In all these problems fracture mechanics plays a major role for the prediction of failure and safe design of materials and structures. These new challenges motivated the author to proceed with the second edition of the book. The second edition of the book contains four new chapters in addition to the ten chapters of the first edition. The fourteen chapters of the book cover the basic principles and traditional applications, as well as the latest developmentsof fracture mechanics as applied to problems of composite materials, thin films, nanoindentation and cementitious materials. Thus the book provides an introductory coverage of the traditional and contemporary applications of fracture mechanics in problems of utmost technological importance. With the addition of the four new chapters the book presents a comprehensive treatment of fracture mechanics. It includes the basic principles and traditional applications as well as the new frontiers of research of fracture mechanics during the last three decades in topics of contemporary importance, like composites, thin films, nanoindentation and cementitious materials. The book contains fifty exampleproblems and more than two hundred unsolved problems. A &quot;Solutions Manual&quot; is available upon request for course instructors from the author.",

These results were obtained by using a three-dimensional finite element analysis.  An angle-ply, laminated thin shell with fiber orientation of [theta/-theta]2 was subjected to compressive mechanical loads.  The laminated thin shell has a cylindrical geometry.  The laminate contained T300 graphite fibers embedded in an intermediate-modulus, high-strength (IMHS) matrix.  The fiber volume fraction was 55% and the moisture content was 2%.  The residual stresses induced into the laminated structure during the curing were taken into account.  Parametric studies were performed to examine the effect on the critical buckling load of the following parameters:  cylinder length and thickness, internal hydrostatic pressure, different ply thicknesses, different temperature profiles through the thickness of the structure, and different layup configurations and fiber volume fractions.  In conjunction with these parameters the ply orientation varied from 0-degree to 90-degrees.  Seven ply angles were examined:  0-degree, 15-degrees, 30-degrees, 45-degrees, 60-degrees, 75-degrees, and 90-degrees.  The results show that the ply angle theta and the laminate thickness had significant effects on the critical buckling load.  The fiber volume fraction and the internal hydrostatic pressure had important effects on the critical buckling load.  The cylinder length had a moderate influence on the buckling load.  The thin shell with [theta/-theta]2 or [theta/-theta]s angle-ply laminate had better buckling-load performance than the thin shell with [theta]4 off-axis laminate.  The temperature profiles through the laminate thickness and various laminates with the same thickness but with the different ply thickness had insignificant effects on the buckling behavior of the thin shells.",

Thin objects, such as pieces of cloth, paper, sheet metal, freeform masonry, and steel-glass structures are particularly rich in geometric structure and so are well-suited for DDG. I show how understanding the geometry of time integration and contact leads to new algorithms, with strong correctness guarantees, for simulating thin elastic objects in contact; how the performance of these algorithms can be dramatically improved without harming the geometric structure, and thus the guarantees, of the original formulation; how the geometry of static equilibrium can be used to efficiently solve design problems related to masonry or glass buildings; and how discrete developable surfaces can be used to model thin sheets undergoing isometric deformation.",

Two stages of the transverse matrix cracks are considered: Stage-I with tunnel cracks in the 90 ° plies aligned parallel to the fibers, and Stage-II with cracks extended across both the 90 and 0 ° plies with intact fibers bridging the matrix in the 0 ° plies. The effect of debonded fiber-matrix interfaces in the 0 ° plies is also considered in Stage-II. Approximate closed form solutions for the overall in-plane thermal conductivities and coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) as functions of matrix crack spacing and constituent properties are obtained using an approach which combines an analysis akin to a shear-lag analysis with finite element results. Emphasis is placed on the important class of composites whose fiber expansivity is smaller than that of the matrix. For this class, matrix cracking and interfacial debonding results in reduced thermal expansivity. Interfacial debonding has a significant effect on both longitudinal conductivity and thermal expansivity, especially the latter.

Fractographic analysis of the failure surfaces by scanning electron microscopy gave insights into the micromechanisms of delamination growth. Improved delamination resistance with an increasing mode II component was attributed to an increase in the total surface area generated. There was a secondary cracking mechanism at 0°/90° ply interfaces which resulted in slightly higher mixed mode toughnesses. Fatigue in thermoset matrix composites is very similar to static failure since there is no mechanism comparable to dislocation movement in metals by which damage can migrate and accumulate under low cyclic stresses. The relatively high scatter in composite toughness was explained in terms of variations in the spatial arrangement of fibres. It was shown how the examination of shear cusps may be used to identify crack growth directions in post-mortem failure investigations",

In the analysis, the sub-laminates are modelled as wide beams, where the laminate stiffnesses are obtained from the classical thin-laminate theory. The effect of having unsymmetric and unbalanced sub-laminates (e.g. coupling effects) are included in the analysis. The interface/&#039;resin-rich&#039; layers are modelled as continuously distributed linear tension/compression and shear springs, and the interaction between the core material and the face laminates is modelled by using a &#039;two-parameter&#039; elastic foundation model. The governing equations are formulated in terms of sets of first-order ordinary differential equations. The multiple-point boundary value problem constituted by the differential equations together with the imposed boundary conditions is solved numerically by direct integration and use of the &#039;multi-segment method&#039; of integration.",

However, controlled buckling of thin films on compliant substrates has been used to advantage in diverse fields such as micro-/nanofabrication, optics, bioengineering, and metrology as well as fundamental mechanics studies. In this Feature Article, a mechanical buckling model is presented, which sprang, in part, from the buckling study of high-quality, single-crystalline nanomaterials. To check the mechanical-buckling phenomenon down to the nano-/molecular scale, well-aligned single-walled carbon nanotube arrays and cross linked carbon-based monolayers are transferred from growth substrate onto elastomeric substrate and then they are buckled into well-defined shapes that are amenable to quantitative analysis. From this nano- or molecular-scale buckling, it is shown that the mechanical moduli of nanoscale materials can easily be determined, even using a model based on continuum mechanics. In addition, buckling phenomena can be utilized for the determination of mechanical moduli of organic functional materials such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and P3HT/6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) composite, which are widely used for organic transistors and organic photovoltaics. The results provide useful information for the realization of flexible and/or stretchable organic electronics. Finally, the fabrication and applications of “wavy, stretchable” single-crystal Si electronics on elastomeric substrates are demonstrated.",

In the past years, a great advance in the study of the remarkable electrical and optical properties of 2D materials fabricated by exfoliation of bulk layered materials has been achieved. Due to the extraordinary mechanical properties of these atomically thin materials, they also hold a great promise for future applications such as flexible electronics. For example, this family of materials can sustain very large deformations without breaking. Due to the combination of small dimensions, high Young&#039;s modulus and high crystallinity of 2D materials, they have attracted the attention of the field of nanomechanical systems as high frequency and high quality factor resonators. In this article, we review experiments on static and dynamic response of 2D materials. We provide an overview and comparison of the mechanics of different materials, and highlight the unique properties of these thin crystalline layers. We conclude with an outlook of the mechanics of 2D materials and future research directions such as the coupling of the mechanical deformation to their electronic structure.",

The laminate resistance to crack multiplication is examined for both uniform and nonuniform crack spacing by substituting the measured applied stress/crack density data into corresponding energy release rate expressions. The resistance curve concept is employed to predict crack growth with increasing applied load. The results indicate that the assumption of uniform cracking and a resistance curve concept is a convenient and acceptable method for modelling crack initiation and multiplication in composite laminates.",

A common feature for both orientations of surface layers is that at decreasing 90-deg ply thickness the characteristic strength and shape parameter increase. The reason is that the surface layers suppress a growth of the defects in the 90-deg ply which are lying close to the interface with the surface layers. This causes the apparent shape parameter to increase from a value a = 6.4 for a thick 90-deg ply (which is comparable to the shape parameter determined on a unidirectional laminate) to a shape parameter of a = 10.47 for a thin 90-deg ply (n = 2) in case of the (02/90,), laminate. Further, it is shown that crack formation in the 90-deg plies of the (±45/90,), laminates is strongly influenced by the severe edge stresses. This causes the applied one-dimensional fracture strain criterion to be inaccurate for the (±45/90,), laminates.",

Study of the effects of ply drops and resin pockets on the tensile behaviour of tapered laminates considering certain important parameters like taper angle, the number of plies dropped, and the fiber orientation is reported here. Estimation of the tensile strength of tapered laminates necessitates accurate determination of the state of stress near the ply-drop region, which is, in general, three-dimensional (3-D) in nature. Recognising the fact that full 3-D finite-element analysis becomes computationally exorbitant, special layered 3-D finite-element analysis is carried out. Laminates with ply drops along only one direction are analysed to elicit the nature of the local bending effects occuring near the ply drops. Complete 3-D Tsai-Wu criterion considering all the six stress components is used to obtain a quick and comparative assessment of the tensile strength of these laminates. High stress concentration zones are identified and the effects of number of plies dropped at a station and resin pocket geometry are illustrated. The mechanism of load transfer near ply drops and the local bending that occurs are described. Susceptibility of ply drop zones to the set and subsequent growth of delaminations is also brought out. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The approach taken has been described as synergistic damage mechanics (SDM) and has been previously illustrated for [0m / ± θn / 0m / 2]s laminates with cracks of equal density in + θ and - θ plies [Singh, C.V., Talreja, R., 2008. Int. J. Solids Struct. 45(16), 4574-4589]. The current work extends the approach to [0m / ± θn / 90r]s and [0m / 90r / ± θn]s laminates with cracks additionally in the 90°-plies. The interaction between the ± θ-cracks and the 90°-cracks is analyzed in terms of the crack surface displacements using a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model and found to be significant only for crack orientations close to 90°. The stiffness degradation of the laminate with all cracking modes simultaneously present is formulated by continuum damage mechanics using a second order tensor characterization of damage. The elastic moduli changes predicted by the SDM procedure are validated by independent three-dimensional FE calculations. For a particular case of quasi-isotropic [0 / 90 / ∓ 45]s laminate, the elastic moduli predictions are evaluated against experimental data. Finally, a parametric study is performed to examine the effects of ply thickness changes on stiffness properties.",

The formulation of the aforementioned finite strip is based on the concept of the semi-energy approach. In this method, the out-of-plane displacement of the finite strip is the only displacement which is postulated by a deflected form. The postulated deflected form is substituted into von K??rm??n&#039;s compatibility equation which is solved exactly to obtain the corresponding forms of the mid-plane stresses and displacements. The solution of von K??rm??n&#039;s compatibility equation and the postulated out-of-plane deflected form are then used to evaluate the potential energy of the related finite strip. Finally, by invoking the Principle of Minimum Potential Energy, the equilibrium equations of the finite strip are derived. The developed finite strip is then applied to analyze the post-local-buckling behavior of thin flat laminates. The results are discussed in detail and compared with those obtained from finite element method (FEM) of analysis. It should be mentioned that the FEM analysis was carried out employing the general purpose ANSYS package.

The two plates are connected through continuity of displacements and tractions at the interface. In addition to determining the effective shear modulus, a singularity analysis is presented in conjunction with a [0??/90??]S bi-directional laminate. The singularity is then utilized in conjunction with the laminate model to look at the interlaminar shear stress near the crack tip along the 0??/90?? interface.

There is a long-standing question regarding the phenomenon that cold stimulation evokes sharper and more shooting pain sensations than hot stimulation. This phenomenon, however, outlives the well-known hydrodynamic theory used to explain dental thermal pain mechanism. Here, we present a mathematical model based on the hypothesis that hot or cold stimulation-induced different directions of dentinal fluid flow and the corresponding odontoblast movements in dentinal microtubules contribute to different dental pain responses. We coupled a computational fluid dynamics model, describing the fluid mechanics in dentinal microtubules, with a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model, describing the discharge behavior of intradental neuron. The simulated results agreed well with existing experimental measurements. We thence demonstrated theoretically that intradental mechano-sensitive nociceptors are not &quot;equally sensitive&quot; to inward (into the pulp) and outward (away from the pulp) fluid flows, providing mechanistic insights into the difference between hot and cold dental pain. The model developed here could enable better diagnosis in endodontics which requires an understanding of pulpal histology, neurology and physiology, as well as their dynamic response to the thermal stimulation used in dental practices.",

The chain molecules are modeled as strings of similar spheres connected via finite extensible nonlinear elastic springs. The fluid is confined between two surfaces composed of identical spheres that are moved to simulate oscillatory flow. In order to mimic experiments, the temperature is controlled by coupling the wall atoms to a heat bath, and the viscoelastic properties are obtained via an analysis using continuum mechanics. Both simple and polymeric fluids exhibit linear viscoelastic behavior under typical simulation conditions, although inertial effects play an important role in determining the flow behavior. Simple fluids display a smooth transition from liquidlike to solidlike behavior when confined to molecularly thin films, whereas linear chain polymers and gels display predominantly elastic shear response at all frequencies investigated.

The material was formed by dispersing single-wall carbon nanotubes in a solvent and then solution casting a thin paper using a mold and vacuum oven. In order to take advantage of the high elastic modulus of carbon nanotubes for actuation, epoxy as a chemically inert polymer is considered. An epoxy layer was cast on the surface of the nanotube paper to make a two-layer ply. A wet electrochemical actuator was formed by placing the nanotube epoxy ply in a 2 M NaCl electrolyte solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were carried out to characterize the electrochemical properties of the actuator. The voltage-current relationship and power to drive the actuator material were also determined. Compared to previous single-wall carbon nanotube buckypaper tape actuators, which had poor adhesion between the nanotubes and tape, and other nanotube-thermal plastic polymer actuators, which could not provide high strength, the epoxy based actuator has a higher elastic modulus and strength, which will be useful for future structural applications. This demonstrates that a polymer layer can reinforce nanotube paper, which is an important step in building a new structural material that actuates. Further work is under way to develop a solid electrolyte to allow dry actuation. Finally, these actuator plies will be laminated to build a carbon nanocomposite material. This smart structural material will have potential applications that range from use in robotic surgical tools to use as structures that change shape.",

The shell&#039;s boundary was fixed at its end. Tsai-Wu failure criterion was used as the composite failure design factor. The analytical results, including critical internal pressure and strains in global directions, were validated with the experimental results for some arbitrarily selected points on the shell surface along meridian axis. Manufacturing of laminated ellipsoidal composite shells was performed by using the Vacuum Infusion Process (VIP), a novel method commonly adopted for the fabrication of laminated composite shells. Surface-bounded sensors were installed on the shells&#039; surface to measure the strain values after the internal pressure was applied. According to the analytical investigation findings, the failure factor was critical at the innermost ply. In addition, for each ply, the shell&#039;s edge was observed to be the region with the highest failure factor. The experimental findings confirmed that the failure occurred in the regions close to the shell&#039;s edge, as predicated by the analytical approach. The results from both approaches were in a close agreement. Subsequently, the effect of various parameters including thickness, aspect ratio, and stacking sequence on the first-ply failure of laminated ellipsoidal woven GFRP composite shell were investigated and the critical mechanical factors to avoid failure were determined.",

We first showed that it was possible to produce suspended graphene membranes even down to one atom thick using exfoliated graphene, and resonate the mem- branes using optical interferometry. The resonators had frequencies in the MHz and quality factors from 20-850, but showed no reproducibility. In order to produce predictable and reproducible graphene resonators we de- veloped methods for making large arrays of single-layer graphene membranes of controlled size, shape and tension using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown graphene. We used transmission electron microscopy to study the polycrystalline structure of the graphene, we found that the different grains stitched together by disordered lines of 5-7 defects. Using electron transport and scanned probe techniques, we found that the polycrystalline grain structure reduces the ultimate strength of the graphene, but did not as strongly affect the electrical properties. We systematically studied the mechanical resonance of the single-layer CVD graphene membranes as a function of the size, clamping geometry, temperature and electrostatic tensioning. We found that the CVD graphene produces ten- sioned, electrically conducting, highly-tunable resonators. In addition we found that clamping the graphene membrane on all sides reduces the variation in the resonance frequency, and makes the behavior more predictable.",

Here, we build a simple mechanical model of a thin film and investigate the generation and development of fragmentation patterns as the material is exposed to various modes of deformation. We find that the characteristic size of fragmentation, defined by the mean diameter of polygons, is strictly governed by mechanical properties of the film material. Our result demonstrates that skin fragmentation on the head of crocodiles is dominated by that it features a small ratio between the fracture energy and Young&#039;s modulus, and the patterns agree well with experimental observations. Understanding this mechanics-driven process could be applied to improve the lifetime and reliability of thin film coatings by mimicking crocodile skin.",

            "abstract": "Many living structures are coated by thin films, which have distinct mechanical properties from the bulk. In particular, these thin layers may grow faster or slower than the inner core. Differential growth creates a balanced interplay between tension and compression and plays a critical role in enhancing structural rigidity. Typical examples with a compressive outer surface and a tensile inner core are the petioles of celery, caladium, or rhubarb. While plant physiologists have studied the impact of tissue tension on plant rigidity for more than a century, the fundamental theory of growing surfaces remains poorly understood. Here, we establish a theoretical and computational framework for continua with growing surfaces and demonstrate its application to classical phenomena in plant growth. To allow the surface to grow independently of the bulk, we equip it with its own potential energy and its own surface stress. We derive the governing equations for growing surfaces of zero thickness and obtain their spatial discretization using the finite-element method. To illustrate the features of our new surface growth model we simulate the effects of growth-induced longitudinal tissue tension in a stalk of rhubarb. Our results demonstrate that different growth rates create a mechanical environment of axial tissue tension and residual stress, which can be released by peeling off the outer layer. Our novel framework for continua with growing surfaces has immediate biomedical applications beyond these classical model problems in botany: it can be easily extended to model and predict surface growth in asthma, gastritis, obstructive sleep apnoea, brain development, and tumor invasion. Beyond biology and medicine, surface growth models are valuable tools for material scientists when designing functionalized surfaces with distinct user-defined properties.",

The method combines concepts from the continuous Galerkin (CG) method, the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and stabilization techniques. A brief review of the CG method, the DG method and stabilization techniques highlights the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and suggests a new approach for the solution of fourth-order elliptic problems. A continuous/discontinuous Galerkin (C/DG) method is proposed which uses Co-continuous interpolation functions and is formulated in the primary variable only. The advantage of this formulation over a more traditional mixed approach is that the introduction of additional unknowns and related difficulties can be avoided. In the context of thin bending theory, the C/DG method leads to a formulation where displacements are the only degrees of freedom, and no rotational degrees of freedom need to be considered. The main feature of the C/DG method is the weak enforcement of continuity of first and higher-order derivatives through stabilizing terms on interior boundaries. Consistency, stability and convergence of the method are shown analytically. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical results, and applications are presented for Bernoulli Euler beam bending, Poisson-Kirchhoff plate bending and a shear layer problem using Toupin-Mindlin strain gradient theory. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper presents a model which is able to capture both geometrical and material nonlinearity. It bases on the finite element formulation of a layered, iso-parametric, quadrilateral shell element which allows for an arbitrary reference surface as well as an arbitrary stacking sequence. Geometrical nonlinearity is accounted for by utilizing Green strains and second Piola–Kirchhoff stresses. Material nonlinearity is considered via a layerwise ideally brittle damage model.

These results were compared with the results of finite element method (FEM) by using ANSYS software, as well as with the results of uncoated elastic half-space.

The optimization is based on gradient based strategies where the required derivatives are formulated by the adjoint approach. The applied solution algorithm combines the well known nonlinear path following strategies with the design update procedure of the shape optimization. This results in robust and flexible methods that require only a minimum of system evaluations. The proposed optimization goals improve the load carrying behavior of the structure and minimize displacements and stresses. It is shown that such efficient designs also exhibit an improved limit load. This contribution illustrates the application of the proposed method by several shape optimization problems. The presented results prove the exceptional performance of the optimized designs even if the optimal design is disturbed by unavoidable imperfections. It is shown that the application of nonlinear kinematics in the shape optimization of thin shell structures allows for a much more realistic system response and gradient data. The proposed approach is applicable to all kind of optimization strategies like topology, sizing or material optimization, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

These thickness variations are accomplished by dropping plies along the length to match varying in-plane and bending loads. This results in a structure which is matched to stiffness and loading requirements. Unfortunately, these ply drops produce internal and local stress concentrations as a consequence of geometric discontinuities and shear lag. In this study, we explore various factors for design of composite structures with ply drops. These factors include: thicknesses, ply stacking sequences, ply drop geometries and manufacturing considerations. In addition, fatigue loading is considered with respect to delamination initiation and growth. A strong sensitivity to the position and the manufacturing details of ply drops is shown for fatigue damage initiation and growth. All studies were conducted on a low-cost E-glass/polyester composite system. The results indicate that it will be difficult to completely suppress damage and delamination initiation in service. However, it was found that, in many cases, there is a threshold loading under which there is little growth after initiation is noted. Factors affecting this threshold are analyzed via the virtual crack closure method in Finite Element Analysis and verified experimentally. Design rules for ply dropping are presented on the basis of these results.",

In this work, we study the effect of ply-level initiation of damage under loading and processing stresses and imposed thermal loading. In particular, included in the study is the prediction and demonstration of a condition of steady-state cracking and the temperature change and loading level necessary to create this damage state, thus leading to the possibility of a predetermined loading range over which layer cracking will not propagate. We also consider the influence of the free-edges on the initiation of layer transverse cracking and potential microcracking that may develop at the fiber/matrix interface. The condition of constrained edge cracking is demonstrated where cracks develop but do not propagate across the laminate. To accomplish these studies unidirectional composites and various cross-ply laminates of IM7/5250-4 (graphite/bismaleimide) were produced and characterized.",

Experiments were carried out to investigate the impact phenomenon of double-ply systems that consists of Twaron?? CT 716 fabric and projectiles of the following nose shapes: hemispherical, flat, ogival (CRH 2.5) and conical (half-angle of 30??). Results obtained revealed that the increase in energy absorption does not necessarily double when the ply number is increased to two. In fact, the ratio of energy absorbed in the double-ply system to that of the single-ply system varies with impact velocity and projectile geometry. At points corresponding to maximum energy absorption, the ratio for all projectile types scatters about an average of 2.1. The amount of deviation from this value depends on the mechanisms that lead to perforation. Failure mechanisms of a double-ply system are similar to those of a single-ply system, but the degree of damage of the impact and distal plies differs. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Tensile and flexural static tests as well as displacement-controlled bending fatigue tests (ratio of 0.10) were conducted on two sets of standard specimens, having fibre orientation parallel to the loading direction (cross-ply specimens) and at 45?? to the loading direction (angle-ply specimens). Specimens were subjected to different fatigue loading, with the initial maximum load level up to 85% of the laminate ultimate flexural strength, and damage in the laminate was continuously monitored through the loss of bending moment during cycling. After 106 cycles the fatigue test was stopped and residual properties were measured on tested specimens. Stiffness-based stress-number of cycle (SN) curves were drawn for the two sets of specimens. The amount of stiffness loss for cross-ply and angle-ply specimens was observed to depend on the fatigue load level. In particular, cross-ply specimens were observed to damage more significantly than angle-ply specimens only at high fatigue loading. This was attributed to different damage mechanisms for the two sets of specimens. Reduction in material strength and elastic modulus as measured after 106 cycles was also found to depend on the level of fatigue loading and to follow different trends for the two sets of specimens. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Residual deposition stresses influence the cracking response by inducing buckling of the film above the crack and by providing an additional. crack driving force once buckling occurs.

Sectioning the surface layer beneath a wear track has revealed it to have acquired severe plastic strains, which suggests that the cracks are ductile fractures, driven by plastic strain rather than elastic stress intensity. The paper reviews recent research into the progressive plastic deformation of surfaces in repeated sliding: the process known as ‘ratchetting’.

This paper presents the thermoelastic degradation of general cross-ply laminates, containing transverse ply cracks, subjected to biaxial extension, bending and thermal loading. The stress and displacement fields are calculated by using the state space equation method [Zhang D, Ye JQ, Sheng HY.

By this approach, a laminated plate may be composed of an arbitrary number of orthotropic layers, each of which may have different material properties and thickness. The method takes into account all independent material constants and guarantees continuous fields of all interlaminar stresses across interfaces between material layers. After introducing the concept of the effective thermoelastic properties of a laminate, the degradations of axial elastic moduli, Poisson&#039;s ratios, thermal expansion coefficients and flexural moduli are predicted and compared with numerical results from other methods or available test results. It is found that the theory provides good predictions of the stiffness degradation in both symmetric and antisymmetric cross-ply laminates.

The present model incorporates, in a full form the shear deformability by means of two features. The first one may be addressed as a mechanical aspect where the effect of shear deformability due to both bending and non-uniform warping is considered. The second feature is connected with the constitutive aspects, and it contemplates the use of different hypotheses adopted in the formulation. These topics are treated in a straightforward way by means of the Linearized Principle of Virtual Works. The model is developed by employing a non-linear displacement field, whose rotations are formulated by means of the rule of semitangential transformation. This model allows studying many problems of static&#039;s, free vibrations with or without arbitrary initial stresses and linear stability of composite thin-walled beams with general cross-sections. A discussion about the constitutive equations is performed, in order to explain distinctive aspects of the effects included in the theory. This paper presents the theoretical formulation together with finite element procedures that are developed with the aim to obtain solutions to the general equations of thin-walled shear deformable composite beams. A non-locking fourteen-degree-of-freedom finite element is introduced. Numerical examples are carried out in several topics of static&#039;s, dynamics and buckling problems, focusing attention in the validation of the theory with respect to experimental data and with 2D and 3D computational approaches. Also, new parametrical studies are performed in order to show the influence of shear flexibility in the mechanics of the thin-walled composite beams as well as to illustrate the usefulness of the model. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

            "abstract": "For a [0/90]s cross-ply laminate subject to uniaxial loading, this paper presents the results of comparisons between the model predictions of stress/strain behaviour, carried out in Part A of the Failure Exercise, and the corresponding experimental data provided after the predictions had been made. In addition, because a new model designed for general symmetric laminates has since been developed, comparisons are shown between the stress/strain predictions of the new model applied to quasi-isotropic and [????]s laminates (with ?? = 45 and 55??), and the corresponding experimental data provided to participants in the failure exercise. Very good correlations between the model and experimental stress/strain data have been achieved for both the cross-ply and quasi-isotropic laminates (subject to both uniaxial and biaxial loading), principally because ply cracking in a single orientation is expected to occur for a significant part of the stress/strain curves. The correlation for [????]s laminates is not as good because the model is not able to account for ply crack formation in both the +?? and -?? plies of the laminate. In addition, the model has not yet been modified to deal with mixed-mode ply crack growth, or with non-linear matrix behaviour which could lead to significant deviations between model predictions and experimental results at large strains. It is emphasised that the models used are not able by themselves to predict strength. Additional damage modes must be taken into account (e.g. fibre fracture) before predictions of strength can be made that are based on the modelling of physical micro-mechanisms associated with laminate failure. A rudimentary physically based approach to the prediction of laminate failure is made by considering fibre strain within the laminate in relation to the average failure strain of a single fibre. The ply cracking models that have been assessed in the paper, for cases where they are expected to be valid, have been shown to lead to good predictions of laminate stress/strain behaviour that is consistent with data provided for the Failure Exercise. The reliability of the models is such that they have good potential for being used as the basis of new design methodology to deal with initial ply crack formation in laminates, and the effects of ply cracking on non-linear stress/strain behaviour for parts of stress/strain curves where ply cracking occurs in a single orientation. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",

The results indicate that it is possible to achieve a sound thin-walled tubular with rib component through hydroforming process and its expiation ratio can reach 20%. According to FEA, the effects of rib height and inner radius on buckling degree were studied and the threshold values of both rib height and inner radius were given. Simulation results indicate that there is a certain value for buckling and the threshold values of rib height and inner radius to thickness are 14 and 30. The formability deteriorates as rib height and rib inner radius increase. At last, the hydroforming limit diagram was drawn for hydroforming thin-walled tubular component with rib of 1Cr18Ni9.

Both tests revealed significant redistribution of strain as damage developed. The results from the thicker-ply specimen show strain redistribution mostly due to the cracking of the top 0?? ply. This was verified by a mesh-independent displacement discontinuity modeling method based on higher order shape functions. Localized effects of sub-surface-ply cracking were not found. However, due to a thinner surface ply and more extensive damage, the thinner-ply specimen showed significant redistribution of strain as a result of the sub-surface-ply cracking as well as the 0?? ply cracking. Evidence of cracking in the center -45?? plies was present in the strain results. Examination of the strain redistribution and the failure surface of the thinner ply specimen led to the development of a failure scenario, where the initiation of critical 0?? fiber cracking occurs slightly away from the hole edge. Future modeling efforts will attempt to verify this scenario.",

At 50% relative humidity, SIEBIMM gave a constant Young&#039;s modulus of 1.5 ± 0.2 GPa for 35-75 nm thick films. Conversely, in vacuum, the Young&#039;s modulus was 10 times larger, at 17.2 ± 1.2 GPa. A slight decrease in buckling wavelength with increasing strain was observed by scanning electron microscopy with in situ compression, and above 10% strain, extensive cracking parallel to the compressive direction occurred. We conclude that whereas PEI acts as a &quot;glue&quot; to hold multiple layers of NFC together, it prevents full development of hydrogen bonding and specific fibril-fibril interactions, and at high humidity, its hygroscopic nature decreases the elastic modulus when compared with pure NFC films.",

First, tension-tension fatigue tests are performed under constant amplitude cycling at room and high temperatures. The normalized S-N relationship for the cross-ply laminate using the normalized stress level agrees with that for the unidirectional laminate made of the same prepreg tape. This implies that the on-axis fatigue behavior of the cross-ply laminate is substantially governed by that of the constituent plies in the laminate. Then, to evaluate the in situ strength of the constituent plies in the cross-ply laminate, static tension and tension-tension fatigue tests are carried out on unidirectional laminates with different number of plies. While the tensile strength of unidirectional laminate significantly depends on the thickness of laminate, the relative fatigue strength is insensitive to the number of plies. Using a modified Tsai-Hill static failure criterion that considers the in situ strength of plies, we can adequately predict the static tensile strength of the cross-ply laminate. Second, based on that fact and the assumption that the final failure of the cross-ply laminate is determined by the failure of axial plies, a simple fatigue failure model for the cross-ply laminate is developed by means of the classical lamination theory and the ply fatigue model considering the in situ static strength of plies. Finally, validity of the proposed model for the fatigue failure of symmetric alternating cross-ply CFRP laminates is evaluated by comparing with experimental results. It is demonstrated that the fatigue strength of the cross-ply laminate in the fiber direction is successfully predicted by the proposed fatigue model with a consideration of the in situ strength of ply. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Applied stress and strain levels to produce significant delamination at ply drops have been determined, and the experimental results correlated through finite element and analytical models. Carbon fiber laminates with ply drops, while performing adequately under static loads, delaminated in fatigue at low maximum strain levels except for the thinnest ply drops. The lower elastic modulus of the glass fiber laminates resulted in much higher strains to produce delamination for equivalent ply drop geometries.

            "abstract": "In this paper, the effect of introducing ply clustering in a composite stacking sequence on the damage resistance and damage tolerance of CFRP composite plates is investigated. Three stacking sequences are considered. First, a baseline laminate with conventional 0°, ±45° and 90° orientations and without ply clustering. The other two laminates are dispersed laminates with orientations not limited to the conventional ones. In one of them, four layers of 0° fiber orientation are clustered together at the specimen mid-plane, whereas in the last configuration, two clusters of two layers of 0° fiber orientation are introduced at the specimen top and bottom surfaces. The in-plane and the out-of-plane stiffness of the dispersed laminates match within 2% those of the baseline laminate. Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is used to select the stacking sequences with the desirable clustering and stiffness constraints. The results obtained demonstrate that introducing clustering had a negative effect on the maximum peak load recorded at different impact energies and also on the projected delamination area. Regarding damage tolerance, the residual compressive strength can be improved up to 30% with ply clustering. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

We also evaluated how sock thickness changed under loading conditions experienced while wearing a lower limb prosthesis compared with unstressed conditions.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN: Experimental. Mechanical assessment.\n\nMETHODS: Seven sock materials of varying ply and sheaths were tested using a custom instrument. Sock thickness under eight different compressive stress conditions and two different biaxial in-plane tensile strain conditions were measured.\n\nRESULTS: For socks woven from a single material, thickness under walking stance phase conditions averaged 0.7, 1.2 and 1.5 mm for 1, 3 and 5-ply, respectively. For socks woven from several materials, the corresponding results were 0.4, 0.7 and 0.8 mm, respectively. Sock ply did not sum, e.g. a 3-ply sock was not three times the thickness of a 1-ply sock.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Sock thickness and compressive stiffness are strongly dependent upon sock material, interface pressure, and in-plane biaxial strain.",

Understanding the electro-mechanical behaviors of such material system is crucial for reliable operation of flexible devices under large deformation. In this paper, we performed in situ mechanical and electrical tests of ITO thin films with two different thicknesses (200 and 80 nm) deposited on polyimide substrates inside a scanning electron microscope. The crack initiation and propagation, crack density evolution and the corresponding electrical resistance variation were systematically investigated. It was found that cracks initiated at a higher tensile strain level and saturated with a higher density in thinner ITO films. Integrated with a coherently formulated mechanics model, the cohesive toughness and fracture strength of ITO thin films and the ITO/polyimide interfacial toughness were quantitatively determined. The experimentally observed thickness dependence of the saturated crack density in ITO thin films was also quantitatively verified by the model. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

The objective of this study was to improve the machining performance during drilling of sandwiched composite using various dimensions of double cone drill. The drill design in terms of its tribological characteristics (i.e. friction, wear) are analyzed including cutting force, life, chip form and hole quality. Results have shown that double cone drills generated less thrust force compared to standard twist drills. No delamination was found in the holes at high feed rates (above 0.1mm/rev). This could be attributed to the presence of thermoplastic nodules between the layers of the CFRP laminate and the presence of woven fabric ply at the bottom of the laminate. Furthermore a relationship between the feed per cutting edge and the thickness of the thermoplastic layer has been developed to promote the formation of continuous chips during drilling. Finally, SEM observations reveal several damage when standard twist drills were used and less damage was observed with double cone drills. These damaged areas were observed in the plies of fibers oriented at −45° and 90° compared with peripheral cutting speed of the drill.",

The first problem is that of a crack in the film oriented perpendicular to the film/substrate interface with the crack tip touching the interface. The second problem is that of a crack of the same geometry, but with length less than the film thickness, so that the crack tip is within the film. These problems are used to model several modes of crack extension in thin films bonded to thick substrate materials. Complete results from the solution of each problem are given over the full range of practical elastic mismatches. Dimensionless quantities important in describing the cracking of thin films are introduced and accurate approximate formulas based on the solution results are given for them. Applications are discussed, including criteria for avoiding thin film crack extension and a formula for the curvature change induced by the cracking of a thin film bonded to a substrate of finite thickness.

Concretely, the state-space formulations, which have been used extensively in laminated structural analyses, are employed. The variations of field variables with time are approximated using the power series expansions. Recurrence formulae that make for easier program are constructed.

The analysis treats the DCB specimen as two Bernoulli-Euler-type laminate beams joined at the mid-plane by a Winkler-type elastic foundation to accomodate transverse elasticity of the uncracked region of the specimen. An experimental study was conducted on glass/ polyester quasi-unidirectional and angle-ply laminate DCB specimens. Specifically, [0]6, [??30]5 and [??45]5 laminates with mid-plane delaminations were considered. Compliance values predicted by the elastic-foundation model were in good agreement with experimental data. The initiation fracture toughness was largest for the unidirectional composite and decreased with increased angle in the angle-ply laminates. The fracture toughness, G(c), increased with increased crack length and became steady-state after some crack propagation for the angle-ply laminates. The R-curve behavior is attributed to the work associated with debonding of transversely oriented fiber bundles and fracture of fibers that bridged the crack surfaces. The angle-ply laminates displayed more yarn debonding and bridging, and steep resistance curves. For all laminates it was observed that the crack propagated in a non-uniform manner across the width of the specimen as explained by elastic coupling effects of the laminate beams.",

Based on these experimental observations, we present a numerical simulation of interlaminar damage propagation, using a cohesive zone model to address the energy-based criterion for damage propagation. This simulation can address the interlaminar delamination with high accuracy by locating a fine mesh near the damage process zone, while maintaining computational efficiency with the use of automatic mesh generation. The simulated results of interlaminar delamination agreed well with the experiment results. Moreover, we demonstrated that the proposed method reduces the computational cost of the simulation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In particular, included in the study are the effect of prescribed boundary conditions on the representative volume element used to describe the problem, the effect of variable crack spacing, and the interaction of transverse crack stress fields. The analysis is accomplished by the use of a model based on Reissner&#039;s variational principle that has been shown to accurately model stress fields and energy release rates in flat laminates. The present model predictions are compared to shear lag and finite element predictions from the literature and found to be in good agreement with published experimental data.

Additionally, it is shown that for large crack densities, the model accurately recovers the limiting theory ply-discount effective property values.",

            "abstract": "Plyometric training (PLY) is a very popular form of physical conditioning of healthy individuals that has been extensively studied over the last 3 decades. In this article, we critically review the available literature related to lower-body PLY and its effects on human neural and musculoskeletal systems, athletic performance and injury prevention. We also considered studies that combined lower-body PLY with other popular training modalities, as well as studies that applied PLY on non-rigid surfaces. The available evidence suggests that PLY, either alone or in combination with other typical training modalities, elicits numerous positive changes in the neural and musculoskeletal systems, muscle function and athletic performance of healthy individuals. Specifically, the studies have shown that long-term PLY (i.e. 3-5 sessions a week for 5-12 months) represents an effective training method for enhancing bone mass in prepubertal/early pubertal children, young women and premenopausal women. Furthermore, short-term PLY (i.e. 2-3 sessions a week for 6-15 weeks) can change the stiffness of various elastic components of the muscle-tendon complex of plantar flexors in both athletes and non-athletes. Short-term PLY also improves the lower-extremity strength, power and stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) muscle function in healthy individuals. These adaptive changes in neuromuscular function are likely the result of (i) an increased neural drive to the agonist muscles; (ii) changes in the muscle activation strategies (i.e. improved intermuscular coordination); (iii) changes in the mechanical characteristics of the muscle-tendon complex of plantar flexors; (iv) changes in muscle size and/or architecture; and (v) changes in single-fibre mechanics. Our results also show that PLY, either alone or in combination with other training modalities, has the potential to (i) enhance a wide range of athletic performance (i.e. jumping, sprinting, agility and endurance performance) in children and young adults of both sexes; and (ii) to reduce the risk of lower-extremity injuries in female athletes. Finally, available evidence suggests that short-term PLY on non-rigid surfaces (i.e. aquatic- or sand-based PLY) could elicit similar increases in jumping and sprinting performance as traditional PLY, but with substantially less muscle soreness. Although many issues related to PLY remain to be resolved, the results of this review allow us to recommend the use of PLY as a safe and effective training modality for improving lower-extremity muscle function and functional performance of healthy individuals. For performance enhancement and injury prevention in competitive sports, we recommend an implementation of PLY into a well designed, sport-specific physical conditioning programme.",

Migration onset location, and subsequent path, are determined as part of the solution, in a mesh-independent fashion.

            "abstract": "The atomic force microscope can detect the mechanical fingerprints of normal and diseased cells at the single-cell level under physiological conditions. However, atomic force microscopy studies of cell mechanics are limited by the &#039;bottom effect&#039; artefact that arises from the stiff substrates used to culture cells. Because cells adhered to substrates are very thin, this artefact makes cells appear stiffer than they really are. Here, we show an analytical correction that accounts for this artefact when conical tips are used for atomic force microscope measurements of thin samples. Our bottom effect cone correction (BECC) corrects the Sneddon&#039;s model, which is widely used to measure Young&#039;s modulus, E. Comparing the performance of BECC and Sneddon&#039;s model on thin polyacrylamide gels, we find that although Sneddon&#039;s model overestimates E, BECC yields E values that are thickness-independent and similar to those obtained on thick regions of the gel. The application of BECC to measurements on live adherent fibroblasts demonstrates a significant improvement on the estimation of their local mechanical properties.",

Systematic experimental and analytical studies are presented in this paper for finite-width stiff thin films buckling on compliant substrates. Both experiments and analytical solution show that the buckling amplitude and wavelength increase with the film width. The analytical solution agrees very well with experiments and therefore provides valuable guide to the precise design and control of the buckling profile in many applications.

            "abstract": "The accurate diagnosis of pneumococcal disease has frequently been hampered not only by the difficulties in obtaining isolates of the organism from patient specimens but also by the misidentification of pneumococcus-like viridans group streptococci (P-LVS) as Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is especially critical when the specimen comes from the respiratory tract. In this study, three novel real-time PCR assays designed for the detection of specific sequence regions of the lytA, ply, and psaA genes were developed (lytA-CDC, ply-CDC, and psaA, respectively). These assays showed high sensitivity (&lt;10 copies for lytA-CDC and ply-CDC and an approximately twofold less sensitivity for psaA). Two additional real-time PCR assays for lytA and ply described previously for pneumococcal DNA detection were also evaluated. A panel of isolates consisting of 67 S. pneumoniae isolates (44 different serotypes and 3 nonencapsulated S. pneumoniae isolates from conjunctivitis outbreaks) and 104 nonpneumococcal isolates was used. The 67 S. pneumoniae isolates were reactive in all five assays. The new real-time detection assays targeting the lytA and psaA genes were the most specific for the detection of isolates confirmed to be S. pneumoniae, with lytA-CDC showing the greatest specificity. Both ply PCRs were positive for all isolates of S. pseudopneumoniae, along with 13 other isolates of other P-LVS isolates confirmed to be non-S. pneumoniae by DNA-DNA reassociation. Thus, the use of the ply gene for the detection of pneumococci can lead to false-positive reactions in the presence of P-LVS. The five assays were applied to 15 culture-positive cerebrospinal fluid specimens with 100% sensitivity; and serum and ear fluid specimens were also evaluated. Both the lytA-CDC and psaA assays, particularly the lytA-CDC assay, have improved specificities compared with those of currently available assays and should therefore be considered the assays of choice for the detection of pneumococcal DNA, particularly when upper respiratory P-LVS might be present in the clinical specimen.",

The structural properties of unpinned and z-pinned carbon fibre–epoxy T-joints that had skin–flange thickness values between 2 mm (thin) and 8 mm (thick) were determined under tension (stiffener pull-off) loading. Experimental testing revealed that the capacity of z-pins to improve the structural properties was strongly dependent on the T-joint thickness. The joint properties increased at a quasi-linear rate with the skin–flange thickness, and z-pin pull-out tests showed that this was due to the increased crack bridging traction load and traction energy. The increase to the structural properties of the z-pinned T-joints with increasing thickness is explained using the bridging traction laws for z-pinned laminates.",

            "abstract": "It has been observed in both ceramic and polymer-matrix composites that the evolution of transverse matrix cracking shows two distinct stages. When tensile stress is applied in the fiber direction of the 0° ply, cracks are formed in the 90° ply at a load level much lower than the ultimate strength of the laminate. As the load increases, more transverse cracks are initiated. At some critical load, the number of cracks ceases to increase; instead, the existing cracks penetrate into the adjacent 0° layers and eventually fracture the 0° fibers. Catastrophic failure becomes imminent when the 0° fibers are broken. The purpose of this paper is to identify conditions under which transverse cracks are deflected into the ply interfaces at the second stage of damage evolution. To this end, the energy release rates for deflection and penetration are used as a criterion to predict the crack growth paths. It is found that the predicted crack path depends on the geometry, the material properties and the degree of damage. Based on this analysis, a crack path prediction diagram is obtained for crack growth at the ply interface. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Such structures in composites are made of tapered laminates involving dropping of plies. However, these structures are often prone to early delamination initiation, which leads to premature failure of the component and therefore limits its useful life. In the past, many routes to circumvent this problem have been evolved, such as the use of adhesive film layers or interleaving the dropped plies between continuous ones. In this work, a novel technique of ply edge chamfering has been developed and employed in the specimen fabrication. Comparisons have been drawn between similarly configured specimens, with and without chamfered ply drops. Static and fatigue test results have shown remarkable improvements, both in terms of complete suppression of delamination around ply drops and in realizing 14.5–77.6% higher strength levels in tapered composite test coupons. The experimental data along with their comparative cases are presented.",

The main concern for designers has focused on the damage tolerance of structures in the presence of delamination damage from impact events. The design approach has been to utilize existing stress/strain-based design criteria to design the part, then to impact the part consistent with the threat and to take a knock-down in design loads in the presence of damage. However, delaminations also occur during service in areas where high interlaminar stresses are present. These are generally at required discontinuities in the design, such as cut-outs, holes, joints or ply-drops. The application of interlaminar fracture mechanics as a design tool for optimizing these regions is still in its infancy and is adopted by very few original equipment manufacturers. This paper addresses this issue and presents the more recent developments in incorporating interlaminar fracture mechanics into design. The paper discusses the improvements in global-local modelling to integrate local design features with global stiffness and load considerations and vice versa. It will address the current methods for characterizing interlaminar fracture behaviour and show examples of how predictions can be made to predict the life of a component.",

LPM uses a perpendicular viewing configuration that directly images a source beam propagated through a thin film. Images are formed in dark field contrast, which is highly sensitive to subtle interfacial structures that are invisible to reference methods. The independent focusing of illumination and imaging systems allows multiple registered optical sources to be hosted on a single platform. These features make LPM a powerful multi-contrast (MC) imaging technique, demonstrated in this work with six modes of imaging in a single instrument, based on (1) broad-band elastic scatter; (2) laser excited wideband luminescence; (3) coherent elastic scatter; (4) Raman scatter (three channels with RGB illumination); (5) wavelength resolved luminescence; and (6) spectral broadband scatter, resolved in immediate succession. MC-LPM integrates Raman images with a wider optical and morphological picture of the sample than prior art microprobes. Currently, MC-LPM resolves images at an effective spectra resolution better than 9 cm(-1), at a spatial resolution approaching 1 mu m, with optics that operate in air at half the maximum numerical aperture of the prior art microprobes.",

In experiments conducted on MEMS thin-film mirrors it is demonstrated that post-release out-of-plane deformation of such structures can be reduced using this ion beam machining method. In doing so optically flat surfaces (curvature &lt;0.001 mm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) are achieved on a number of 3 &amp;mu;m-thick surface micromachined silicon structures, including mirrors with either initially positive curvature or initially negative curvature measuring up to 0.02 mm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. An analytical model incorporating the relevant mechanics of the problem is formulated and used to provide an understanding of the mechanisms behind the planarization process based on ion machining. The principal mechanisms identified are 1) amorphization of a thin surface layer due to ion beam exposure and 2) gradual removal of stressed material by continued exposure to the ion beam. Curvature history predictions based on these mechanisms compare well with experimental observations.",

Many roofing systems also incorporate membranes that are not fully adhered such as mechanically fastened single-ply membranes. Under a negative air pressure differential caused by wind suction, these wall and roof membranes can deform or balloon. Ballooning of the membrane affects many aspects of its performance. For instance, it changes the volume of the air chamber in screen-type wall systems and therefore, affects both the extent of screen pressure moderation and the nature of ventilation within the wall. In case of the single-ply roofing membrane, excessive ballooning can tear or rupture the membrane at the mechanical fastener location and therefore fail the membrane as the primary waterproofing component in the roofing system. This paper develops the structural mechanics for flexible membranes ballooning in three dimensions under a negative air pressure differential. The governing differential equation is derived and solved numerically. A second-order paraboloid of revolution is assumed to describe the ballooning shape. A series of physical tests were conducted to confirm that the ballooning shape follows the second-order paraboloid of revolution and compare the model predict with the test data. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, they are envisaged to be the ideal reinforcements for polymer composites, especially for enhancement of mechanical properties. However, the superiority of the mechanical properties of nanotubes alone does not ensure mechanically superior composites because the composite properties are strongly influenced by the mechanics that govern the nanotube-polymer interface. The structural strength characteristics of composite materials greatly depend on the mechanical load transfer from the matrix (polymer interface) to the nanotube and the strength of the interface. Hence, the knowledge and understanding of the nature and mechanics of load transfer between nanotube and polymer is critical for manufacturing of enhanced carbon nanotube-polymer composites and will enable in tailoring of the interface for specific applications or superior mechanical properties.

A peel ply fabric is used as a removable layer in a composite lay-up and ripped off to modify the surface for adhesive bonding. A peel ply can affect the elemental composition of a surface and it is possible to distinguish between either a polyester or a polyamide peel ply treatment for a specific composite system and application. However, consistent and generalised relationships between the compositional modification or the surface energy and adhesive or resin adherence to treated surfaces are not probable. A compositional analysis and surface energy measurements are affected by the fractured matrix, peel ply fibre cavities and revealed reinforcements.

We use a combination of surgical manipulations and quantitative measurements to confirm this hypothesis and provide a simple theory for this change in the shape of a doubly curved thin elastic shell subject to differential growth across its planform. Our experiments and theory overturn previous hypotheses that suggest that blooming is driven by differential growth of the inner layer of the petals and in the midrib by providing a qualitatively different paradigm that highlights the role of edge growth.

Active cannulas derive bending not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms but from elastic tube interaction in the backbone itself, permitting high dexterity and small size, and dexterity improves with miniaturization. They are designed to traverse narrow and winding environments without relying on ldquoguidingrdquo environmental reaction forces. These features seem ideal for a variety of applications where a very thin robot with tentacle-like dexterity is needed.

The effect is perceived by users as an increase in skin tightness (firmness) accompanied by skin smoothing and elimination of wrinkles and lines. The aim of the study was to assess whether high molecular weight synthetic polymers, in the form of simple skin treatment formulations, could modify mechanical properties of natural skin as well as artificial skin models. METHODS: In experiments involving natural skin, the formulations were employed to treat the inner forearm of five panelists, who ranged in age from mid-20s to mid-40s. Indentometric analysis also included rubber skin models, with various viscoelastic characteristics, modified by deposition of thin polymer films on the surface. Polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyquaternium-55, polyimide-1, VP/acrylates/lauryl methacrylate copolymer, and sodium alginate were investigated. The effects of the products were quantified by mechanical skin indentation performed at small deformations. Data analysis was performed using the Hertz theory of contact mechanics, which included the calculation of fundamental parameters such as the modulus of elasticity. RESULTS: The indentometric analysis revealed an increase in the Young&#039;s modulae for both artificial and natural skin as a result of treatment with the polymers. The effect was dependent on the amount of deposited product, which was varied in the range from 0.053 to 1.06 mg/cm(2) of polymer. The observed increases in Young&#039;s modulae were typically from about 0.7 to 1.4 x 10(4) N/m(2) for untreated skin to 1.4-2.0 x 10(4) N/m(2) for polymer-modified skin, depending on the polymer structure (molecular weight) and the amount of deposition. By the analysis of artificial skin models, it was found that the magnitude of stiffening depends on the mechanical characteristics of the base material. Softer skin models displayed larger increases in Young&#039;s modulus after polymer treatment than stiffer skin models. Also, the analysis of skin models suggested that polymeric treatments can lower the viscoelasticity of skin as demonstrated by decreased values of hysteresis loss factors calculated from indentation force vs. penetration depth plots. The performance of the polymers was also shown to be dependent on ambient humidity with the most hygroscopic materials loosing their stiffening effect at high humidity. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that high molecular weight polymers can be useful as skin stiffening, firming, or tightening agents. This was demonstrated by indentometric, mechanical analysis of natural skin and artificial skin models, and by determining Young&#039;s modulae and viscoelastic parameters.",

It is found that the delamination occurs in a deflection-controlled condition and is a process of Mode II dominated unstable crack growth and subsequent arrest. The fracture behavior can be described by strain energy release rate and the delamination size is governed by the delamination arrest toughness of the composite.",

The analysis is based on superposition of compliance and strain-energy release rate expressions previously derived from laminated beam theory for DCB and ENF angle-ply laminate specimens. Elastic interactions between the two arms of the specimen, asymmetry in lay-up, and interlaminar shear deformation are incorporated in the analysis. It was found that the ratio between G(I) and G(II) is only slightly sensitive to ply angle in the angle-ply laminates, where G(I) and G(II) denote the mode I and mode II components of the strain energy release rate, G. The ratio G(I)/G(II), likewise, is only weakly dependent on crack length. An experimental study on glass/polyester quasi-unidirectional and angle-ply laminates was conducted. Specifically, [0](6), [+/-30](5) and [+/-45](5) laminates with midplane delaminations were tested at various mode ratios (G(I)/G(II)) Predicted compliance values were in good agreement with experimental data. The fracture toughness, G(c), increased with decreased ratio G(I)/G(II). G(c) increased with increased ply angle theta in the angle-ply laminates except for pure mode I conditions. Nonuniform and skewed crack fronts were observed for the angle-ply laminates as a result of elastic coupling in the laminate beams of the cracked region. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cell responses to the mechanical properties of type 1 collagen gels are discussed, followed by a description of a model system of very thin, mechanically tunable collagen films that evoke similar responses from cells as do gel systems, but have additional advantages. Cell responses to thin films of collagen suggest that at least some of the mechanical cues that cells can respond to in their environment occur at the sub-micron scale. Mechanical properties of thin films of collagen can be tuned without altering integrin engagement, and in some cases without altering topology, making them useful in addressing questions regarding the roles of specific integrins in transducing or mitigating responses to mechanical cues.

Features of the modeling that are required to obtain the accurate deformation behavior for this class of materials under these loadings are highlighted. To this end, a comparison is made between the concentric cylinder model and the uniaxial stress model for representing the [0] laminate. The axial stresses from the two models are very similar under mechanical loading. The greatest differences appear under thermal loading alone. The differences on the composite response between a time-independent elastic-plastic and a viscoplastic matrix constitutive model are also examined. The latter is based on the Bodner-Partom unified constitutive model. The [0/90] laminate is treated by adding a parallel element with smeared [90] ply properties to the [0] model and invoking axial strain compatibility as well as stress equilibrium. The proposed constitutive law for the [90] ply includes both matrix viscoplasticity and fiber/matrix separation damage and is based on damage mechanics concepts. The effect of cyclic frequency on TMF behavior is examined. The in-phase TMF life is shown to be very sensitive to frequency due to the relaxation of matrix stress and the attendant increase in fiber stress.",

As a result, it was observed that the behavior of damage growth was different depending on the applied stress level.

The effect of substrate deformation on the deflection of the loaded film is taken into account by using a line spring model. For small deflections, an analytical solution is derived, while for large deflections a numerical solution is obtained using the shooting method. The resulting load-shaft displacement relation, which is essential in blister tests, compares favorably with finite element analysis.",

When two macroscopically flat bodies with microroughness come in contact, the contact occurs at multiple asperities of arbitrary shapes, and varying sizes and heights. Deformation at the asperity contacts can be either elastic and/or elastic–plastic. If a thin liquid film is present at the interface, attractive meniscus forces may affect friction and wear. Historically, statistical models have been used to predict contact parameters, and these generally require many assumptions about asperity geometry and height distributions. With the advent of computer technology, numerical contact models of 3-D rough surfaces have been developed, particularly in the past decade, which can simulate digitized rough surfaces with no assumptions concerning the roughness distribution. In this article, a comprehensive review of modeling of multiple-asperity contacts in dry and wet conditions is presented. Contact models for homogeneous and layered, elastic and elastic–plastic solids with and without tangential loading are presented. The models reviewed in this paper fall into two groups: (a) analytical solutions for surfaces with well-defined height distributions and asperity geometry and (b) numerical solutions for real surfaces with asperities of arbitrary shape and varying size and height distributions. Implications of these models in friction and wear studies are discussed.",

An improved method was developed to fabricate small batches of good quality fiberreinforced elastomer prepreg. Strengths of the method include excellent fiber adhesion, medium to high fiber volume fractions, highly parallel fibers, use of traditional advanced composites fabrication methodologies, and reproducible ply thicknesses. Silicone/cotton, silicone/fiberglass, urethane/cotton, and urethane/fiberglass elastomer/fiber combinations were studied. Balanced angle-ply laminates of each fiber-reinforced elastomer system were laminated from the prepreg with off-axis angles ranging from 0° to 90° in 15° incre-ments. The specimens had fiber volume fractions of 12% to 62%, using fiberglass and cotton fibers, respectively. Tensile stress-strain results of elastomers, dry and elastomer-impregnated cotton fiber, and the fiber-reinforced elastomer specimens are presented and discussed. The axial stiffness of individual cotton fibers increased 74% to 128% when impregnated with an elastomer. The stiffening trend of the silicone rubber and softening trend of the urethane rubber are reflected in the stress-strain response of their respective fiber-reinforced elastomer specimens. Nonlinear shear and transverse properties for each material combination were extracted from 45° and 90° stress-strain data. Nonlinearity of the stress-strain curves are functions of fiber angle, elastomer type and the amount of deformation. An accurate nonlinear FRE model is presented. It is based on classical lamination theory and has been modified to include geometric and material nonlinearity. Geometric nonlinearity is included in the form of nonlinear strain-displacement relations. Material nonlinearity is included in the form of nonlinear orthotropic material properties as a function of extensional strain. The nonlinear strain-displacement relations and the nonlinear material models were added to the FORTRAN code of a pre-existing composites analysis software package. Results from the nonlinear FRE model are compared with test results of balanced angle-ply specimens. Correlation between predicted and experimental results range from good to excellent. A “rubber muscle” which exhibits high contractive forces was also fabricated and modeled as part of the work.",

However, experimental data are scarce and the measurement techniques used in the past are time consuming and involve a lot of specimen handling during testing. While some physical information is currently well consolidated (such as the dependence of the strength on ply thickness, or in situ strength), there still remain relevant open questions. This work presents a methodology, which does not interfere with the tensile test, to detect transverse cracks by optical means. Four different configurations of CFRP are considered. The results show that the in situ strength depends on the thickness of the ply and the orientation of the adjacent layers. In the case of thick transverse plies, the strength is controlled by full-width transverse cracks whereas, in thin plies cracking parallel to the specimen’s mid-plane occurs before transverse matrix cracking.",

            "abstract": "Geometrically perfect plates that are restrained from in-plane expansion when slowly and uniformly heated generally develop compressive stresses and then buckle at a specific temperature. The equivalent mechanical loading concept is used to straightforwardly develop solutions to several fundamental thermal buckling problems involving simple laminated plate configurations and the most simple heating environment, namely uniform heating throughout the plate volume. The analysis is restricted to linear elastic stress-strain behavior and constant orthotropic lamina material properties at a specific temperature. Results are obtained for unidirectional and symmetric cross-ply laminated fiber-reinforced composite rectangular plates that are uniaxially restrained in their plane on two of the four edges, but have no edge rotational restraint on any edge. Those boundary conditions constitute two of the four possible types of simply supported edges that differ only in their in-plane conditions. The results are presented in the form of buckling temperature change from the stress-free temperature (at which no stress is generated against the restraint) versus plate aspect ratio curves festooned for different buckling mode shapes for all laminates. Anomalous examples include unidirectionally laminated plates that actually buckle upon cooling instead of heating and cross-ply laminated plates that do not buckle irrespective of whether they are heated or cooled. Those examples are of interest because of their intriguing possible design applications. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We introduce here an elegant, efficient measurement method that yields the elastic moduli of nanoscale polymer films in a rapid and quantitative manner without the need for expensive equipment or material-specific modelling. The technique exploits a buckling instability that occurs in bilayers consisting of a stiff, thin film coated onto a relatively soft, thick substrate. Using the spacing of these highly periodic wrinkles, we calculate the film&#039;s elastic modulus by applying well-established buckling mechanics. We successfully apply this new measurement platform to several systems displaying a wide range of thicknessess (nanometre to micrometre) and moduli (MPa to GPa).",

Certain mechanical properties of the fibres have also been investigated. The beam stiffnesses of the sheets, and also their through-thickness Young&#039;s moduli, have been measured. These results have been compared with model predictions. It is shown that the beam stiffnesses are in all cases significantly lower than expected from simple bending theory. This is attributed to the low through-thickness stiffness of the core and also to a low resistance to shear. Modelling of these properties has facilitated the identification of changes to the core structure, which should lead to improved beam stiffness, while retaining a low density. Increased fibre diameter, and possibly an alteration to the fibre sectional shape, are the most promising changes. Of course, implications for other properties, and for ease of manufacture, will also need to be borne in mind. ?? 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the Timoshenko beam problem, the proposed method is shown to provide the best approximation in an energy-type norm which is equivalent to the L2-norm for all the unknowns, uniformly with respect to the thickness parameter. The same formulation remains valid also for the asymptotic Euler–Bernoulli solution. As another one-dimensional model problem we consider the modelling of the so called basic edge effect in shell deformations. In particular, we derive a special norm for the test space which leads to a robust method in terms of the shell thickness.

The structure and protein-protein interactions of the cardiac sarcomere that are responsible for these processes will be reviewed. The molecular mechanism that underlies myofilament activation is incompletely understood. Recent experimental approaches have been employed to unravel the mechanism and regulation of myofilament mechanics and energetics by activator calcium and sarcomere length, as well as contractile protein phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase A. Central to these studies is the question whether such factors impact on muscle function simply by altering thin filament activation state, or whether modulation of cross-bridge cycling also plays a part in the responses of muscle to these stimuli. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Grain growth during film formation or during post-deposition annealing can play a dominant role in defining these microstructural characteristics, and therefore, the mechanical properties of films. Stress can suppress or promote grain growth. In the latter case, stress promotes texture evolution during grain growth. Grain growth can serve as a stress relief mechanism in both elastically isotropic and anisotropic materials, and can also promote plastic yielding.",

Assuming a two-parameter Weibull distribution of tensile strength of the transverse plies to represent randomly distributed manufacturing defects, multiple crack formation in the plies is simulated in the non-interactive and interactive regimes of cracking using the local stress fields calculated by a variational analysis. The statistical methodology is demonstrated on crack density evolution in cross ply laminates manufactured by four different processing routes and loaded in monotonic tension in the axial direction. The differences in the crack density evolution, supposedly due to different defect population induced by the four manufacturing conditions, could be described by the proposed statistical simulation method.",

            "abstract": "The increased use of composite materials in a wide spectrum of industries has led to the development of improved predictive techniques, which can aid in the detailed understanding of the behaviour of a composite component or structure to a range of potentially damaging threats. This paper presents an energy based damage mechanics model for woven carbon composites under high strain loading. This damage mechanics approach introduces five damage variables for in plane damage per ply layer. The damage variables are associated with warp and weft fibre damage in both tensile and compressive failure modes, with an additional damage variable to determine the deterioration of the fibre–matrix interface. The damage variables are directly related to the stiffness degradation within the composite laminae and ultimately within the laminate. The evolution of damage in each mode is controlled via a series of damage-strain equations, thus allowing the total energy dissipated for each damage mode to be set as a material parameter, which is mesh size independent. The damage mechanics approach has been implemented into both the LLNL and LS versions of DYNA3D for plane stress (shell) elements. This encompasses both the standard shell element and the solid-shell formulations available within these codes. In the present paper, validation examples are presented for this damage model. The tensile and the tensile-shear responses are modelled at a coupon level, including relevant strain rate effects and tabs, with the proposed damage model. The results show very good agreement with the available experimental data. Suggestions are also presented for additional non-standard experimental tests to derive all material model parameters directly, rather than an inverse modelling approach in which uniqueness may not be guarantee. This paper also presents an interface modelling technique for explicit FE codes. The formulation is again based on damage mechanics and uses only two constants for each delamination mode; firstly, a stress threshold for damage to commence, and secondly, a critical energy release rate for the particular delamination mode. The model has also been implemented into the LLNL DYNA3D Finite Element (FE) code and the LS-DYNA3D commercial FE code. The interface element modelling technique is applied to a series of common fracture toughness based delamination problems, typically the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test, and validated for the dynamic case via a simple analytical plate impact simulation. A subsequent part II paper describes the results of simulations using the proposed damage mechanics based models on a series of experimental CRAG plate impact tests.",

            "abstract": "One of the primary advantages of using fibre-reinforced laminated composites in structural design is the ability to change the stiffness and strength properties of the laminate by designing the laminate stacking sequence in order to improve its performance. This procedure is typically referred to as laminate tailoring. Traditionally, tailoring is done by keeping the fibre orientation angle within each layer constant throughout a structural component. Allowing the fibres to follow curvilinear paths within the plane of the laminates constitutes an advanced tailoring option that can lead to modification of load paths within the laminate to result in more favourable stress distributions and improve the laminate performance. Based on numerical simulations, the present work demonstrates the advantages of variable-stiffness over straight-fibre laminates in terms of compressive buckling and first-ply failure. A physically based set of failure criteria, able to predict the various modes of failure of a composite laminated structure, is implemented in finite element models of straight and variable-stiffness panels under compression. Non-linear analyses are carried out to simulate first-ply failure in the postbuckling regime. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

These closed-form solutions are contrasted with point-load models that neglect the contact size (i.e. classical Schwerin-type solutions), and lead to important differences in the indentation strain and load-deflection response. The accuracy of these closed form expressions is illustrated by comparisons with detailed numerical results and experiments on thin elastomer films. We show that the closed-form solutions can be used to extract mechanical properties from indentation testing of freestanding films, with important implications for developing new tests on nanoscale films and/or compliant materials such as polymers and biological substances.

The damage, consisting of small cracks running parallel to the fibers, leads to a loss of stiffness in the warp, weft and shear directions. The model presented here describes the evolution of the damage up to failure of the first ply. By replacing the woven ply by two stacked unidirectional plies corresponding to the warp and weft thicknesses, this general model is extended to cover a broad range of plies, from quasi-unidirectional to balanced woven plies. A continuum damage approach (CDM) is then used to define the behaviour of the two virtual unidirectional plies under static and fatigue loading conditions. The model is applied here to an unbalanced woven ply with glass reinforcement and the results of the simulations are compared with experimental data. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The cross-ply 0 composite laminate was made of thermosetting P7051S-20Q-1000 prepregs (Toray Composites America). A Hopkinson pressure bar (HPB) was employed to create the impulsive loading with varying magnitude. Transient impact force, displacement, impact power, and transmitted impact energy were calculated using the transient signals recorded from the strain gage mounted on the HPB. Impulsive loads with controllable magnitude were used to induce delamination damage with varying size in the composite samples. Nondestructive evaluation based on a novel ultrasonic pulse-echo reflector technique was used successfully for characterizing the delamination areas in the thin composite samples with thickness ∼2 mm. The present experimental results indicate that there exists a very good linear correlation between the impact force (e.g. the peak force, impact impulse, peak impact power, and the transmitted impact energy of the first impact force pulse exerted by the HPB) and the delamination area of the composite samples. This correlation can be used to determine the threshold of the impact force that initiates the delamination damage in the composite laminate. In contrast to the weight-drop test, the present experimental method successfully examined the impact damage tolerance of polymer matrix composites (PMCs) subjected to impulsive loading with very high force magnitude and ultra short duration such as the typical ballistic impact. The present method and results can be used for the study of impact damage tolerance of PMCs with varying lay-ups and interface modifications. © 2008 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

            "abstract": "The locomotion of primates differs from that of other mammals in three fundamental ways. During quadrupedal walking, primates use diagonal sequence gaits, protract their arms more at forelimb touchdown, and experience lower vertical substrate reaction forces on their forelimbs relative to their hindlimbs. It is widely held that the unusual walking gaits of primates represent a basal adaptation for movement on thin, flexible branches and reflect a major change in the functional role of the forelimb. However, little data on nonprimate arboreal mammals exist to test this notion. To that end, we examined the gait mechanics of the woolly opossum (Caluromys philander), a marsupial convergent with small-bodied prosimians in ecology, behavior, and morphology. Data on the footfall sequence, relative arm protraction, and peak vertical substrate reaction forces were obtained from videotapes and force records for three adult woolly opossums walking quadrupedally on a wooden runway and a thin pole. For all steps recorded on both substrates, woolly opossums always used diagonal sequence walking gaits, protracted their arms beyond 90 degrees relative to horizontal body axis, and experienced peak vertical substrate reaction forces on forelimbs that were significantly lower than on hindlimbs. The woolly opossum is the first nonprimate mammal to show locomotor mechanics that are identical to those of primates. This case of convergence between primates and a committed fine-branch, arboreal marsupial strongly implies that the earliest primates evolved gait specializations for fine-branch locomotion, which reflect important changes in forelimb function.",

Reliable application of structures requires a knowledge of their stress/strain and failure behavior. past treatments involved assumptions in both the stress and failure analyses; they become increasingly more difficult when the failure of the microstructure constituents is to be included in the continuum analysis of the laminates. Recognizing the conventional failure criteria used for composite material analyses, this work adopts the first-ply failure criterion by application of a polynomial function and the finite element procedure. The laminates are modeled by the Reissner-Mindlin plate theory that accounts for moderate rotation. This is because shear effects are more pronounced in composite laminates whose transverse shear modulus is low relative to the Young&#039;s modulus. Failure loads are obtained for different laminate thicknesses, stacking sequences and aspect ratios and different failure criteria. The results show that predictions made from the maximum stress criterion are nearly the same as the others, except for those obtained by the Hill criterion.",

To underline this problem, damage initiation and mode of fracture around circular hole of cross-ply and angle-ply of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) specimens subjected to tensile loading have been studied experimentally and numerically. A comprehensive notch-edge damage analysis was performed with help of recording test video, digital microscope, Polariscope, and layer by layer SEM (scanning electron microscope) analysis. To understand the effect of manufacturing process on the quality of hole and to avoid its influence on the actual result, a number of manufacturing methods and cutting parameters were used and based on the found result appropriate method was selected for further study. From tensile test, results showed that the tensile strength, crack initiations and propagations around hole are influenced by the quality of notch. Experimental observation showed that the effectiveness of finding of damaged zone is dependent on the damage observation techniques.

            "abstract": "The increased use of composite materials in a wide spectrum of industries has led to the development of improved predictive techniques, which can aid in the detailed understanding of the behaviour of a composite component or structure to a range of potentially damaging threats. This paper presents an energy based damage mechanics model for woven carbon composites under high strain loading. This damage mechanics approach introduces five damage variables for in plane damage per ply layer. The damage variables are associated with warp and weft fibre damage in both tensile and compressive failure modes, with an additional damage variable to determine the deterioration of the fibre-matrix interface. The damage variables are directly related to the stiffness degradation within the composite laminae and ultimately within the laminate. The evolution of damage in each mode is controlled via a series of damage-strain equations, thus allowing the total energy dissipated for each damage mode to be set as a material parameter, which is mesh size independent. The damage mechanics approach has been implemented into both the LLNL and LS versions of DYNA3D for plane stress (shell) elements. This encompasses both the standard shell element and the solid-shell formulations available within these codes. In the present paper, validation examples are presented for this damage model. The tensile and the tensile-shear responses are modelled at a coupon level, including relevant strain rate effects and tabs, with the proposed damage model. The results show very good agreement with the available experimental data. Suggestions are also presented for additional non-standard experimental tests to derive all material model parameters directly, rather than an inverse modelling approach in which uniqueness may not be guarantee. This paper also presents an interface modelling technique for explicit FE codes. The formulation is again based on damage mechanics and uses only two constants for each delamination mode; firstly, a stress threshold for damage to commence, and secondly, a critical energy release rate for the particular delamination mode. The model has also been implemented into the LLNL DYNA3D Finite Element (FE) code and the LS-DYNA3D commercial FE code. The interface element modelling technique is applied to a series of common fracture toughness based delamination problems, typically the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test, and validated for the dynamic case via a simple analytical plate impact simulation. A subsequent part II paper describes the results of simulations using the proposed damage mechanics based models on a series of experimental CRAG plate impact tests. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Pseudocapacitance metal oxides such as MnO₂ are well known for their high electrochemical performance and can be coated on carbon nanotube yarns to significantly improve the performance of two-ply carbon nanotube yarn supercapacitors. We produced a high performance asymmetric two-ply yarn supercapacitor from as-spun CNT yarn and CNT@Mn₂2 composite yarn in aqueous electrolyte. The as-spun CNT yarn serves as negative electrode and the CNT@MnO₂ composite yarn as positive electrode. This asymmetric architecture allows the operating potential window to be extended from 1.0 to 2.0 V and results in much higher energy and power densities than the reference symmetric two-ply yarn supercapacitors, reaching 42.0 Wh kg(-1) at a lower power density of 483.7 W kg(-1), and 28.02 Wh kg(-1) at a higher power density of 19,250 W kg(-1). The asymmetric supercapacitor can sustain cyclic charge-discharge and repeated folding/unfolding actions without suffering significant deterioration of specific capacitance. The combination of high strength, flexibility and electrochemical performance makes the asymmetric two-ply yarn supercapacitor a suitable power source for flexible electronic devices for applications that require high durability and wearer comfort.",

Owing to the curvature of the shell, the position of the piezoelectric layer has a great effect on the deformation. The effect of the P-layer as the outer surface or inner surface is investigated. It is found that to achieve the same amount of deformation, different levels of electric fields have to be applied depending on the P-layer configuration. The efficiency of the P-layer on shells with various stacking sequences is also studied and it is observed that the efficiency is determined by the stacking sequence of the composite layers.

Using the sum of the CTE values along the principal material directions as an effective measure of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTEeff), we have shown and provided a proof that the smallest value of CTEeff is rendered by straight fiber path configurations. The laminates considered are sufficiently thin so as to neglect the thermal stresses induced through the thickness of the laminate. It is found that the minimal CTEeff values occur for [+45/-45]ns lay-ups. This result is supported by numerical studies that consider curvilinear fiber paths. The possibility of obtaining zero CTE values along both principal material directions and the conditions that render this situation are also examined. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

A three-dimensional finite element program was also developed to analyze the interlaminar stress distributions in the specimens. The results of test data strongly indicate that the ply orientation and laminate thickness significantly influence the in-plane shear strengths of the laminates. This effect could be attributed to the inherent flaws introduced during manufacturing processes and to interlaminar stresses in laminates.

The bending of the coating under the softer substrate induces concentrated tensile stress regions at the lower and upper surfaces of the coating, from which cracks may ensue. The evolution of such damage in a model transparent system (glass/polycarbonate) is viewed in situ from below and from the side of the specimen. The critical load needed to initiate a crack on the lower coating surface generally increase proportionally to the coatings thickness, d. An interesting departure from this trend occurs for thin coatings, where the fracture load, although marred by a large scatter, increases somewhat with decreasing d. The fracture data for the upper coating surface are limited to relatively thick coatings due to the recurrence of premature failure from the coating edges. The behavior in this range is similar to that for the lower surface crack, albeit with an order of magnitude greater fracture resistance. A fracture mechanics analysis in conjunction with FEM is performed to elucidate the stress intensity factors responsible for crack propagation. A crack normal to the coating surface is assumed to emanate either from the-lower or upper surface of the coating. A major feature of the solution is the occurrence of a bending-induced compression stress field over a region ahead of the crack tip. This effect, which become more dominant as the ratio between the contact length and the coating thickness is increased, tends to delay the onset of crack propagation, especially for the lower surface crack. Consequently, in applications associated with large indenters, thin and/or tough coatings and stiff substrates, cracking from the upper coating surface may precede that from the lower surface. An interesting feature of this crack shielding mechanism is that when the coating surface contains a distribution of flaws rather than a single crack, small flaws in this population may be more detrimental than large ones. Incorporation of these aspects into the analysis leads to a good correlation with the test results. In the special case of line loading, which constitutes a lower bound for the critical loads, a closed-form, approximate solution for the stress intensity factors or the critical loads are obtained. Plane-strain indentation, although less common than spherical indentation, allows for characterizing the fracture resistance of opaque films through observation from the specimen edge. This approach is not easily implemented to thin films (i.e., less than about a hundred microns), however. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In multi-directional composites with internal 0??-plies, catastrophic failure also initiates by kinking of 0??-plies at the free-edges or manufacturing defects, followed by delamination. When 0??-plies are located at the outside, or in the case of cross-ply laminates, failure rather tends to occur by out-of-plane buckling of the ??-plies.

            "abstract": "Based on recent in situ measurements, Chason et al. (2002) proposed that the evolution of compressive stress during thin film growth by vapor deposition is due to an increase in surface chemical potential in the presence of growth flux and the consequent exchange of adatoms between the free surface and the grain boundaries. Based on this hypothesis, we present a model for grain boundary stress evolution during thin film growth. To illustrate the mechanics of the problem, first it is assumed that the local normal stress on the grain boundary is proportional to the local grain boundary opening only. The resulting &quot;linear spring&quot; model captures all essential features of the experimental observations. A more accurate description of the grain boundary stress evolution is presented by modeling the stress field due to the material inserted into the grain boundary as that resulting from a continuous distribution of dislocations along the grain boundary. The adatom flux between the grain boundary and the free surface is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potential between the two. This model successfully explains a wide range of experimental observations, including the development of compressive stress during room temperature growth, effect of growth rate on the kinetics of compressive stress evolution and the continued tensile stress generation during low-temperature growth.

The second relates to the common use of the Hertz contact mechanics model, which leads to significant errors when applied to thin samples. We develop novel, simple to use corrections to apply for such cases. Samples that are either bonded or not bonded to a rigid substrate are considered. The third problem concerns the difficulty in establishing when contact occurs on a soft material. We obtain error estimates for the elastic modulus resulting from such uncertainty and discuss the sensitivity of the estimation methods to error in contact point.

The damage development is modelled by two sets of cohesive elements, (i) periodically embedded in the carbon layer for modelling carbon fibre failure and (ii) at the glass/carbon interface to capture delamination. The analysis is stopped when the glass layer failure is predicted by integrating the stress distribution over the glass layer to calculate an equivalent stress for unit volume of the glass. The proposed method is validated against the experimental results and then used to simulate the progressive damage process of other hybrid configurations and finally produce a damage-mode map for this material set. The method can easily be applied to other hybrids to assess their performance by producing damage-mode maps. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

This is due to the limitation of transverse strain in the plies due to constraints exerted by neighboring plies. At laminate angles of 50 ° and above the transverse and shear strains in the plies are not sufficiently constrained and cause failure in the matrix material. The constraint effect is present in fatigue but since the polymeric matrix material is sensitive to fatigue loading fatigue failure will occur at much lower strain levels than in static loading. This effect cannot be offset by increasing the ductility of the matrix material. Thus, strain to failure under fatigue loading will be only a small fraction of the static strain to failure for angle ply laminates with ply angles up to around 45 ° where the static strength is due to the constraint effect.",

Despite our inability to provide such a homogenization theory, if one truly exists, we can devise approaches to predict the fiber/matrix interfacial stresses in an arbitrary cell by applying certain displacements and/or tractions on the cell boundaries. These boundary conditions are those derived by representing each layer in the laminate by conventional effective modulus theory. It is shown that these approximations can lead to reasonably accurate interfacial stresses and offer great promise as a means of solving practical laminate problems reinforced by fibers of moderate diameter.

Constant amplitude tension-tension fatigue tests are first performed on the coupon specimens of the cross-ply laminate for various fiber orientations. The fiber orientation dependence of the off-axis fatigue data on the cross-ply laminate can be removed by normalizing the maximum fatigue stress levels with the help of the associated off-axis static strengths. The distribution of the normalized off-axis fatigue data on the cross-ply laminate almost agrees with the normalized fatigue data on the unidirectional laminate made of the same prepreg tape, indicating that the relative fatigue performance of the cross-ply laminate is almost indistinguishable from that of the unidirectional laminate. A simple off-axis fatigue analysis of the cross-ply laminate is then attempted on a ply basis, in which no effects of progressive damage are assumed. A ply fatigue model that takes into account the in situ principal strengths of the plies embedded in a general laminate is developed to this end, along with an analytical procedure for identifying the in situ strength ratios of the actual principal strengths to reference values. The actual stress components in the plies embedded in the cross-ply laminate are evaluated using a laminate constitutive model based on the classical lamination theory, in which the non-linear plastic deformation of inclined plies under in-plane off-axis loading is taken into account. It is demonstrated that good guesses about in situ strength ratios can be made on the basis of elastoplastic CLT analysis, and the off-axis fatigue lives of the cross-ply laminate predicted using appropriate in situ strength ratios are shown to agree well with the experimental results. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A cross-ply [0/90]2s glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite laminate was manufactured using the hand lay-up technique. This laminate was cut at different off-axis angles (0??, 15??, 30??, 45??, 60??, 75?? and 90??) to give specimens with different stacking sequences ([0/90]2s, [15/-75]2s, [30/-60]2s, [45/-45]2s, [60/-30]2s, [75/-15]2s and [90/0]2s respectively). The tensile properties (strength, modulus and Poisson&#039;s ratio) of cross-ply laminate were determined experimentally. Shear modulus and the tensile elastic properties of cross-ply laminate with different off-axis angles were predicted theoretically from the elastic properties of the constituent materials. The results show that Young&#039;s modulus measured from the stress-strain diagram drawn using strain gauge readings in the tension test is more than six orders of magnitude higher than those determined from the stress-strain diagram of the testing machine. The predicted value of the Young&#039;s modulus of cross-ply specimen, [0/90]2s, has excellent agreement with the experimental results. The maximum in-plane shear strength is found for specimens with 45?? and 60?? off-axis angles, i.e. for [45/-45]2s and [60/-30]2s specimens respectively. On the other hand specimens with 0?? and 90?? off-axis angles have the minimum in-plane shear strength. The predicted values of in-plane shear modulus of cross-ply laminate with different off-axis angles (0-90??) agree very well with the experimental results.

In this study, direct pull-off TSL adhesion tests were interpreted based on a fracture mechanics approach. An edge crack propagation equation for a generic case (ν≠0.5) was derived and the failure modes of TSLs were studied. It was found that the current TSL adhesion test sample geometries show confined behaviour, the failure mode of the tests are edge crack propagation. Bulk cavitation of TSLs can only occur for very compliant samples (E&lt;0.6MPa). Adhesion tests done on a TSL product, Tekflex, applied on concrete substrates were examined to verify the edge crack propagation.",

The formulation incorporates the effect of elastic coupling, restrained warping, transverse shear deformation associated with thin walled composite structures. A first order shear deformation theory is considered with the beam deformation expressed in terms of axial, spanwise and chordwise bending, corresponding shears and twist. The formulated locking free element uses higher order interpolating polynomial obtained by solving static part of the coupled governing differential equations. The formulated element has super convergent properties as it gives the exact elemental stiffness matrix. Static and free vibration analyses are performed for various beam configuration and compared with experimental and numerical results available in current literature. Good correlation is observed in all cases with extremely small system size. The formulated element is used to study the wave propagation behavior in box beams subjected to high frequency loading such as impact. Simultaneous existence of various propagating modes are graphically captured.

Such a movement of gas or liquid (collectively called “fluid”) is called the “flow,” the study of which is called “fluid mechanics.” The science of flow has been classified into hydraulics, which developed from experimental studies; and hydrodynamics, which developed through theoretical studies. Hydraulics developed as a purely empirical science with practical techniques beginning in prehistoric times. Leonardo da Vinci made many discoveries and observations in the field of hydraulics. He forecast laws, such as the drag and the movement of a jet or falling water. Furthermore, he advocated the observation of internal flow by floating particles in water, that is, “visualization of the flow.” The advent of hydrodynamics, which tackles fluid movement both mathematically and theoretically, was considerably later than that of hydraulics.

            "abstract": "Numerical modelling of composites is becoming ever more important to commercial aircraft manufacturers for design-phase cost reductions and improved lead times. The implementation of a user-defined numerical model for damage prediction in composites is described. All modelling is conducted in ABAQUS/Standard (an implicit solver) and the models demonstrate stable performance with significant levels of damage. This stability is often difficult to achieve when modelling damage with implicit solvers. The favourable performance is due to the damage variable evaluation, which uses information from the previous iteration of an increment to drive damage development during a given load step. This &quot;pseudo-current&quot; damage evaluation is complex to implement, however, the stable performance and the improved time-step size dependence justifies this approach. The method is applied to analyse cross-ply open-hole tension specimens having similar layups but demonstrating different damage growth and varying failure loads. The analysis includes in-plane damage, delamination and splitting mechanisms and a nonlocal regularisation scheme to mitigate spurious mesh sensitivity. The delamination and splitting mechanisms are essential for differentiating between the various specimen types. The damage evolution method provides stability to the implicit solver allowing significant levels of damage to develop within the laminates, giving a valuable prediction of laminate behaviour. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

In a prospective study of CAP aetiology, an EDTA plasma sample was collected together with blood culture in 92 adult CAP patients and 91 adult controls. Among the 92 CAP patients, lytA PCR was positive in eight (9%), Spn9802 PCR was positive in 11 (12%) and ply PCR was positive in 19 (21%) cases. Of 91 controls, the ply PCR was positive in eight cases (9%), but no positive cases were noted by Spn9802 or lytA PCRs. Ten CAP patients had pneumococcal bacteraemia. Compared to blood culture, PCR for lytA, Spn9802 and ply had sensitivities of 70% (7/10), 60% (6/10) and 70% (7/10), and specificities of 96% (79/82), 94% (77/82) and 85% (70/82) respectively. With blood culture and/or culture of representative sputum, and/or urinary antigen detection, S. pneumoniae was identified in 31 CAP patients.

The key challenge is the intricate interplay of physics and geometry, which leads to a mechanical response much different from the response of solid objects. The quest to understand the underlying phenomena has spawned theoretical and experimental studies, which have helped in understanding the underlying mechanisms of deformation and response of shells. Here, we use numerical simulations to study the response of shells when they are deformed deeply into the nonlinear regime. We use computational models to study the mechanics of highly deformed elastic shells in several classical problems: indentation of elastic spherical caps by a flat rigid plate and a rigid sharp indenter and pure bending of circular and oval cylinders.

In the present paper, a prediction is presented for the transverse crack density including the effect of delamination growth. The prediction shows better agreement with the experimental results, especially for laminates with thicker 90 ° plies in which extensive delamination occurs. Loading/unloading tests have also been performed to obtain the Young&#039;s modulus reduction and the permanent strain as functions of the damage state.

The fiber-peeling damage was described by peeling-off of fiber bundles from the specimen surface after micro-scale damage of matrix resin and fiber-matrix interface. Most of the ply-cracking damage develops at an early stage of stress cycles, and slightly increases during fatigue, while the fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies initiates from the edges of 0?? plies and evolves in the whole area of laminates with an increase in stress cycles. The fatigue fracture seems to occur when the 0?? plies lose their load carrying capacity by the evolution of the fiber-peeling damage. In the off-axis fatigue tests, the fatigue fracture is caused by the initiation and evolution of ply-cracking damage and succeeding delamination. It is concluded that the fatigue strength is governed by the fiber-peeling damage in 0?? plies under on-axis cyclic loading and by the ply-cracking damage and delamination under off-axis cyclic loading. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Bulging tests were performed with a custom built fluidic cell to characterize large circular membranes. The fluidic cell allows the media (such as air or water) to wet one side of the membrane while maintaining the other side dry. Pressure was applied to the membrane via a liquid manometer through the fluidic cell. The resulting load-deflection curves show membranes that are extremely flexible, and they can be reproducibly loaded and unloaded. Such devices may potentially be used as mechanical and chemical sensors, and as a bio-nano/micro interface to study cellular mechanics in both static and dynamic environments.",

Assuming a rigid-plastic material and using the condition of kinematic continuity on the boundaries between rigid and deformable zones, a basic folding mechanism is constructed. This mechanism closely reproduces all the main features of folds and wrinkles actually observed on typical crumpled sheet metal structures. Calculations based on the energy balance postulate show that two-thirds of the plastic energy is always dissipated through inextensional deformations at stationary and moving plastic hinge lines. The extensional deformations are confined to relatively small sections of the shell surface but they account for the remaining one-third of the dissipated energy. The theory is illustrated by application to the problem of progressive folding of thin-walled rectangular columns. A good correlation is obtained with existing experimental data as far as the mean crushing force and the geometry of the local collapse mode is concerned.",

Guiry. These species are anatomically, morphologically, ecologically and phylogenetically similar. We quantified: 1.(1) mechanical properties of the stipe; and2.(2) flow forces on the stipe relative to thallus area and biomass of these species, to determine mechanical and morphological characteristics that could explain the greater winter dislodgement of C. crispus thalli in mixed stands. Although stipes of both species broke at the same mean force, C. crispus stipes were relatively thick, weak and extensible compared to the relatively thin, strong and stiff stipes of M. stellatus. Risk of breakage increased with size in both species because: 1.(1) their stipes weakened with increasing cross-sectional area; and2.(2) cross-sectional area of the stipe failed to increase in linear proportion to frond area. Drag on C. crispus thalli of &gt; 3 g fresh weight was greater than on M. stellatus of the same biomass, whereas drag on smaller fronds ( &lt; 3 g fresh weight) of the two species was similar. Drag on large C. crispus thalli was greater mainly because they exhibit greater surface area for a given biomass than do large M. stellatus. Dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces has more severe ecological consequences for M. stellatus because regeneration from holdfasts is slower than in C. crispus. A reduced surface area:biomass ratio coupled with greater strength may lessen wave-induced disturbance and be important to maintaining a high abundance of M. stellatus in the low intertidal zone of wave-swept shores.",

Apart from the crack density, these expressions depend only on the elastic and geometrical properties of constituent laminae and the average crack opening displacement (ACOD) normalized in the proper way. Calculations of the ACOD are performed and analyzed with the FEM and analytical models used for the stress analysis in [1]. The predicting capabilities of approximate models are discussed in comparison with experimental data and FEM results.

The CNT yarn is treated with gamma irradiation and the yarn surface is coated with the PEDOT/PSS to improve the energy storage capacitance of the as-spun yarn supercapacitor. A layer of PVA gel is coated on the surfaces of the CNT yarn and the composite yarn to form a separation layer containing electrolyte. The results show that the gamma irradiation greatly increases the electrical conductivity and improved the gram capacitance of the as-spun CNT two-ply yarn supercapacitor. The coating of PEDOT/PSS on the surface of the pure and irradiated CNT yarns further significantly improves the capacitance of the supercapacitors. The two-ply yarn supercapacitor constructed from the irradiation CNT yarn coated by PEDOT/PSS exhibits the large capacitance and high cyclic charge-discharge stability. Moreover, these two-ply yarn supercapacitors with fine diameters are highly flexible and can be easily woven or knitted into textile fabrics for uses in wearable electronics. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",

The collagenous building-block of tendon is the fibril, long and thin, and more-or-less circular in cross-section. The diameters of fibrils are well-known, but their lengths remain uncertain. The basic structural question is: do fibrils run the whole length of the tendon, or does each fibril have at least one end in the tendon? This is a simple question, with no simple answer. Difficulties in measuring elastic modulus, UTS and hysteresis stem from the problem of clamping the tendon into the test machine. This is circumvented by tests carried out in life. Fatigue is both the focus of this journal, and is also especially important for tendon. Susceptibility to fatigue is such that rupture is only avoided by ongoing repair, with each tendon being only just adequate for its habitual stresses. Fatigue rupture of tendon involves longitudinal cracks leaving long, thin interdigitating fibrous units. At the deepest level, the whole of biology involves forces acting on materials, which puts the Mechanics of Materials at the centre of Biology. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "The mechanical properties of interphase regions at bi-material interfaces can be quite different from the surrounding bulk materials. For composite materials, this interphase region is usually thin but plays an important role in their overall mechanical properties. Nanoindentation has become a commonly used experimental technique for measuring the mechanical properties of materials, especially when one of the dimensions is small. However, the extraction of reduced elastic modulus from the nanoindentation of thin films on substrates can pose challenges due to the influence of the substrate. In this study, the nanoindentation of thin films on substrates has been examined with a view to extracting the reduced modulus of thin polymer films. Thin films of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (C9H23NO3Si, γ-APS) were deposited on silicon. An interfacial force microscope (IFM) was used to indent the γ-APS films. The effect of the substrate was studied by considering two very different thicknesses (4μm and 46nm). The nanoindentation data were analyzed via contact mechanics theories and a finite element analysis that incorporated surface interactions. The analyses showed that nanoindentation experiments can provide reliable values of film modulus when the film is very different from the substrate. It was found that the commonly used rule of thumb that the indentation depth should be less than 10% of the thickness did not eliminate substrate effects for a wide range of material combinations. Instead, it is proposed that the contact radius should be less than 10% of the thickness so that contact mechanics theories for monolithic materials can be used without considering the presence of the substrate. The modulus of γ-APS polymer films and the surface energy between the tungsten tip of the IFM and γ-APS films were extracted and were related to their cure. A completely cured 46nm thick γ-APS film had a reduced modulus of 3.5±0.5GPa. This value falls in the usual range for polymers due to the amorphous nature of the γ-APS films.",

It also promises to have a deep impact on applied science, including coatings technology and design of microelectromechanical systems. Despite the considerable results achieved by indentation experiments, particularly in the measurement of bulk hardness on nanometre scales, the contact behaviour of realistic surfaces, showing random multiscale roughness, remains largely unknown. Here we report experimental results concerning the mechanical response of self-affine thin films indented by a micrometric flat probe. The specimens, made of cluster-assembled carbon or of sexithienyl, an organic molecular material, were chosen as prototype systems for the broad class of self-affine fractal interfaces, today including surfaces grown under non-equilibrium conditions, fractures, manufactured metal surfaces and solidified liquid fronts. We observe that a regime exists in which roughness drives the contact mechanics: in this range surface stiffness varies by a few orders of magnitude on small but significant changes of fractal parameters. As a consequence, we demonstrate that soft solid interfaces can be appreciably strengthened by reducing both fractal dimension and surface roughness. This indicates a general route for tailoring the mechanical properties of solid bodies.",

            "abstract": "Spherical indentation of a thin, hard coating bonded to a thick substrate is investigated. The bending of the coating over the softer substrate induces concentrated tensile stresses on the lower and upper coating surfaces, from which transverse cracks may ensue. This work is primarily concerned with ring cracks originating from the top surface of the coating. In-situ indentation tests are carried out on a model glass/polycarbonate bi-layer, with the coating thickness and the indenter radius being the main test variables. As the coating thickness is decreased, the critical load to initiate ring cracks progressively departs from that associated with a critical surface stress, the effect that increases with increasing the indenter radius. A fracture mechanics approach in conjunction with the FEM technique is used to elucidate the onset of cylindrical ring cracks in thin-film bi-layer structures due to spherical indentation. The analysis, conducted as a function of the coating thickness and the indenter radius, reveals the existence of bending-induced compression stress regions ahead of the crack tip, which tend to shield the crack or increase the fracture resistance. The specific behavior is dictated by a complex interplay between the contact radius, a, the coating thickness, d, and the crack length, c. An interesting manifestation of this shielding mechanism is that when the coating surface contains flaws of various sizes, small flaws in this population may be more detrimental than large ones. Incorporation of this aspect into the analysis led to a good correlation with the experimental results. In the limit case of point-load, a closed-form, approximate solution for the stress intensity factors and the critical loads is obtained. This solution constitutes a lower bound for the critical loads, and is furthermore directly applicable to finite size indenters provided d &gt;&gt; a. In the limit c/d --&gt; 0, a failure stress criterion may be used irrespective of the ball radius, r. The analysis in this case reveals that decreasing either d/r or the coating/substrate modulus ratio tend to favor ring cracking over radial type cracking. The transition between these two failure modes is identified explicitly as a function of the system parameters.",

For films 61 nm to 1.7 μm thick, the Young’s modulus was constant but strongly dependent on relative humidity. Films were stiffer at lower relative humidities, with modulus values of 16 ± 5, 12 ± 1, and 3.5 ± 0.3 GPa at 30%, 42%, and 64% relative humidities, respectively. CNC/PEI films had larger elastic moduli than NFC/PEI films. Both types of nanocellulose multilayer films showed the same modulus dependence on relative humidity over the range studied. Results suggest that ambient water might have an even more pronounced role in nanocomposites than in traditional natural fiber-reinforced composites. This straightforward buckling-based method has quantified mechanical properties and provided a useful comparison between CNC and NFC films. Furthermore, it qualitatively assesses that the components in the composite film are highly compatible and that the hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity of cellulose and PEI combined do not allow for the full mechanical potential of crystalline cellulose nanoelements to be exploited. This work is one approach toward finding dependable methods to characterize nanocellulose, specifically cellulosic thin films, which is increasingly important as we extract nanocellulose from wood, plants, algae, bacteria, and animals and enter a new age of cellulose materials.",

Materials systems used were toughened T800H/3631 and conventional T300/3601 carbon/epoxy composites. In situ observation of the microscopic failure process was conducted by using a scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with instrumented tensile loading devices and by the replication technique. Progressive damage parameters such as the transverse crack density and the delamination ratio were measured. Thermal residual strains which had important effects on the failure process were measured by the ply separation method. On the basis of the above data, a simple modified shear-lag analysis including the thermal residual strains was conducted to obtain the transverse crack density as a function of laminate strain, considering the constraint effect and the strength distribution of the transverse layer. The analysis was also extended to the system containing delamination.",

This code is useful for obtaining stresses in regions affected by delaminations, transverse cracks, and discontinuities related to inherent fabrication anomalies, geometric configurations, and loading conditions. Particular attention is focussed on those layers or groups of layers (sublaminates) which are immediately affected by the inherent flaws. These layers are analyzed as homogeneous bodies in equilibrium and in isolation from the rest of the laminate. A theoretical model used to analyze the individual layers allows the relevant stresses and displacements near discontinuities to be represented in the form of pure exponential-decay-type functions which are selected to eliminate the exponential-precision-related difficulties in sublaminate/ply level analysis.",

To avoid the difficulties of 3D mesh generation and 3D interface modeling between the layers, the cohesive interface layer is implemented in the Reddy’s full layer-wise plate theory. An angle-ply laminate is analyzed to evaluate the developed CDM+cohesivelayer in edge delamination initiation and evolution during uniaxial tension loading.

Quasi-static burst tests were performed on tubes of 25°, 55° and 75° winding angle. The tubes were burst under internal radial pressure with minimum end constraints. An experimental rig and two conditioning tanks were designed and built to test the specimens at three temperatures; -46°C (low temperature) and +20°C (room temperature) and +70°C (high temperature). For each test the internal pressure and the strains in both circumferential and longitudinal directions were recorded on suitable digital processing equipment. For a particular batch of tubes tested at three different temperatures, an increase in ultimate hoop strain and a decrease in hoop modulus of the 55° tubes with increasing temperatures was recorded; the temperature effect was less pronounced on the corresponding properties of 25° and 75° tubes. The use of a non-structural thin liner during the tests led to a higher ultimate strength of 55° tubes but had negligible effect on the behaviour of 25° and 75° tubes. The 75° tubes failed in a catastrophic fibre fracture under all test conditions. The mode of failure of 55° changed from weeping at 70°C to fibre fracture at -46°C. The 25° tubes failed by weeping with matrix cracking. The matrix cracking was particularly severe when a liner was used.",

To improve the dynamic performance of the piezolaminated composite structures, it is necessary to experimentally investigate the resonant characteristics of these structures. Three measurement techniques are used in this study to investigate the vibration behavior of the tested specimen. The first method, AF-ESPI (amplitude-fluctuation electronic speckle pattern interferometry) is the major technique for measuring the resonant characteristics of a single-layer piezoceramic plate and a multilayer cross-ply GFRP (glass fiber reinforced plastics) piezolaminated composite plate for completely free conditions. The completely free condition is approximated in experiment by placing and partially sticking the specimen on the surface of a very soft sponge. A thin single-layer piezoceramic plate is first investigated and up to the twenty-sixth transverse modes are presented. Excellent quality of interferometric fringe patterns for vibration mode shapes are presented. The second method, LDV (laser Doppler vibrometer), and the third method, impedance analyzer, are both employed to verify the AF-ESPI results for the piezolaminated composite plate. Both in-plane and out-of-plane resonant frequencies and vibration mode shapes of the piezolaminated composite plate are demonstrated. Finally, numerical computations based on the finite element analysis are presented for comparison with the experimental results. Excellent agreement between the measured data and the numerical results is found in resonant frequencies and mode shapes for the single-layer piezoceramic plate and the cross-ply piezolaminated composite plate.",

By utilizing optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopes, the generation and growth of interlayer consists of γ (Mg 17Al 12) and Β (Mg 2Al 3) phases was verified between the constituent layers in the Mg/Al with total thicknesses of 4.56 and 11.21μm during annealing at 300°C for 1 and 3h, respectively. Although as-rolled clad metal was somewhat joined by mechanical locking at the interface, annealing-induced generation of thin diffusion layer between AZ31 and Al3004 by annealing at 300°C for 1h resulted in the enhancement of uniaxial tensile properties in terms of elongation. However, further annealing for 3h lead to weakening the interface bonding properties due to the significant generation of brittle intermetallic phases. The mechanism for retarding interface delamination along the direction of tensile axis was confirmed by the observation from the side surfaces of ex-situ stepped tensile-test specimens. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

We also derive the canonical commutation relations. Then we adopt the following four guide lines. First, we do not premise the relations between dynamical variables in classical mechanics. Second, we define energy, momentum, and angular momentum as the constants of motion that are derived from homogeneity and isotropy in space and time on the basis of principle of space and time. Since energy and momentum are quantitatively defined in classical mechanics, we define them in quantum mechanics so that the corresponding conservation laws are satisfied in a coupling system of a quantum particle and a classical particle. Third, we define Planck&#039;s constant and the mass of a particle as proportionality constants between energy and frequency due to one of Einstein-de Broglie formulas and between momentum and velocity, respectively.

It is based on the observation of notch tip damage which can be quantified by the extent of the individual failure processes, splitting in the 0° plies and delamination between the 0° ply and off-axis plies. The notch tip damage zone grows stably under tensile cyclic loading in a self-similar manner and the size and shape of this damage zone is dependent on laminate geometry and constituent properties of the fibre, matrix and interface. The post-fatigue strength and stiffness of the laminate can be related uniquely to the split length, which defines the extent of damage growth. In this first paper in a series of four, observation is made and measurements taken of the damage growth mechanisms that make up the damage zone in carbon fibre/epoxy laminates. Radiographs are used to characterise the notch tip damage zone and to establish a qualitative relationship between post-fatigue strength (or stiffness), cyclic stress, damage size and numbers of cycles.",

The purpose of the investigation described in this paper is to study numerically the way in which the multi-ply panels deform and to identify the energy absorption in different panel constructions. The FE model was created using ABAQUS to simulate the transverse impact of a projectile onto various woven fabric panels. Influencing factors such as the impact velocity, panel construction and the number of plies are taken into account in the FE simulations. The numerical predictions show that the orientation of plies significantly affects the energy-absorbing capacity of the multi-ply fabric panels. The angled panels always increase the energy-absorbing capacity, compared with the aligned panel, by as much as 20%, depending on the number of plies in the panel. In addition, the stacking sequence of oriented plies also plays an important role in absorbing the energy. For the multi-ply fabric panel with large numbers of plies, there is an optimised sequence of plies which can maximise the energy-absorbing capacity of the panel. An important aspect of the work is validation of the numerical technique. It is shown that the FE predictions are highly consistent with the experimental study [1].",

The effectiveness of the remedy is demonstrated by simulations of small patches, a bias extension test and diaphragm forming of a 3-ply simple cup. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The approach is based on the assumption that subcritical damage modifies the notch-tip stress field and that the state of subcritical damage just before failure, referred to as the terminal damage state (TDS), must have a significant influence on notched strength. The TDS was monitored for a wide range of cross-ply graphite reinforced epoxy specimens using real-time radiography. A finite element model incorporating the TDS was used to determine the modified notch-tip stress field. A simple tensile stress failure criterion has been found to predict failure very well provided that the effect of subcritical damage is considered in this way. The effect of both layup and notch size on strength can be entirely accounted for by the effect these parameters have on the terminal damage state. In the first paper of a four-part series, radiographs of c. 60 specimens have been used to characterize the notch-tip damage zone and to establish a qualitative relationship between terminal damage and notched strength.",

            "abstract": "The lung parenchyma comprises a large number of thin-walled alveoli, forming an enormous surface area, which serves to maintain proper gas exchange. The alveoli are held open by the transpulmonary pressure, or prestress, which is balanced by tissues forces and alveolar surface film forces. Gas exchange efficiency is thus inextricably linked to three fundamental features of the lung: parenchymal architecture, prestress, and the mechanical properties of the parenchyma. The prestress is a key determinant of lung deformability that influences many phenomena including local ventilation, regional blood flow, tissue stiffness, smooth muscle contractility, and alveolar stability. The main pathway for stress transmission is through the extracellular matrix. Thus, the mechanical properties of the matrix play a key role both in lung function and biology. These mechanical properties in turn are determined by the constituents of the tissue, including elastin, collagen, and proteoglycans. In addition, the macroscopic mechanical properties are also influenced by the surface tension and, to some extent, the contractile state of the adherent cells. This chapter focuses on the biomechanical properties of the main constituents of the parenchyma in the presence of prestress and how these properties define normal function or change in disease. An integrated view of lung mechanics is presented and the utility of parenchymal mechanics at the bedside as well as its possible future role in lung physiology and medicine are discussed.",

The specimens were representative of the kind of fibre misalignment that can occur in components at ply drops and resin rich areas. Experimental characterisation techniques using strain gauge software were also developed for detecting the initiation of delamination and its propagation, by measuring interlaminar transverse displacements. Specimens with longitudinal discontinuous plies did not fail in compression but rather failed by delamination initiating at the ply drops. None of specimens with transverse discontinuous plies failed directly in compression due to misalignment in the wavy plies. The fatigue failure mechanisms are the same as those observed under static loading in previous work, which facilitates development of a fatigue model.",

Initially, the governing equations obtained by use of Hamilton&#039;s principle for the vibration of cross-ply laminated plates with simply supported boundary conditions at all of their edges are solved by an exact analytical method. In the case of cross-ply laminated square plates subjected to twelve different combinations of free, clamped and simply supported edge boundary conditions, the free vibration frequencies are obtained by applying the Ritz method where the five displacement components are assummed as the series of simple algebraic polynomials.

            "abstract": "Deposition processes control the properties of thin films; they can also introduce high residual stresses, which can be relieved by delamination and fracture. Tungsten films with high 1-2 GPa compressive residual stresses were sputter deposited on top of thin (below 100 nm) copper and diamond-like carbon (DLC) films. Highly stressed films store large amounts of strain energy. When the strain energy release rate exceeds the films&#039; interfacial toughness, delamination occurs. Compressive residual stresses cause film buckling and debonding, forming open channels. Profiles of the buckling delaminations were used to calculate the films&#039; interfacial toughness and then were compared to the adhesion results obtained from the superlayer indentation test. Tests were conducted in both dry and wet environments and a significant drop in film adhesion, up to 100 times was noticed due to the presence of moisture at the film/substrate interface. © Society for Experimental Mechanics 2007.",

The electrospun fibers were arranged depending on angles of alignment, which were 180°, 90°, 60°, and 45°. The stress and strain values of the fibrous PHBV cross-ply scaffolds increased as the cross-ply angle increased. At 180°, the strength and strain values of the fibers depended on tensile loading directions. At an alignment of 90°, the PHBV scaffolds had a stress value of 3.5 MPa, which was more than two times higher than the random structure. The cell morphology and proliferation of L-929 cells was strongly dependant on the fiber alignment and the best results were observed when the angle alignment was high. The results of this study showed that the cross-ply structure of the PHBV scaffold affected not only the cell adhesion and spreading properties but also dictated the mechanical properties, which were dependent on the angles of alignment.",

It is not possible to give rules for general application of fracture mechanics concepts. Yet our comprehension of cracking and fracture beha viour of materials and structures is steadily increasing. Further developments may be expected in the not too distant future, enabling useful prediction of fracture safety and fracture characteristics on the basis of advanced fracture mechanics procedures. The user of such advanced procedures m\lst have a general understanding of the elementary concepts, which are provided by this volume. Emphasis was placed on the practical application of fracture mechanics, but it was aimed to treat the subject in a way that may interest both metallurgists and engineers. For the latter, some general knowledge of fracture mechanisms and fracture criteria is indispensable for an apprecia tion of the limita tions of fracture mechanics. Therefore a general discussion is provided on fracture mechanisms, fracture criteria, and other metal lurgical aspects, without going into much detail.

In the present theory, the stresses are considered distributing unequally along the wall thickness and various coupling effects are taken into account. The calculation formulas of torsional angle and stress given by this method are concise and easy to use. The present analysis results indicate that by reason of coupling effects, in general, the free torsion of composite box beams may not exist definitely, so a concept of torsion without external restraint is suggested.

Design typically involves an initial conceptual stage during which many options are considered. At this stage, quick approximate analytical methods are crucial in determining which of the initial proposals are feasible. The ideal would be to get within 30% with a few lines of calculation. The designer also needs to develop experience as to the kinds of features in the geometry or the loading that are most likely to lead to critical conditions. With this in mind, the author tries wherever possible to give a physical and even an intuitive interpretation to the problems under investigation. For example, students are encouraged to estimate the location of weak and strong bending axes and the resulting neutral axis of bending before performing calculations, and the author discusses ways of getting good accuracy with a simple one degree of freedom Rayleigh-Ritz approximation. Students are also encouraged to develop a feeling for structural deformation by performing simple experiments in their outside environment, such as estimating the radius to which an initially straight bar can be bent without producing permanent deformation, or convincing themselves of the dramatic difference between torsional and bending stiffness for a thin-walled open beam section by trying to bend and then twist a structural steel beam by hand-applied loads at one end. In choosing dimensions for mechanical components, designers will expect to be guided by criteria of minimum weight, which with elementary calculations, generally leads to a thin-walled structure as an optimal solution. This consideration motivates the emphasis on thin-walled structures, but also demands that students be introduced to the limits imposed by structural instability. Emphasis is also placed on the effect of manufacturing errors on such highly-designed structures - for example, the effect of load misalignment on a beam with a large ratio between principal stiffness and the large magnification of initial alignment or loading errors in a strut below, but not too far below the buckling load.",

The SST describes the sequence of ply-drops ensuring the transition between a thick guide laminate and a thinner one. A blended design is represented by a SST combined with a thickness distribution over the regions of the structure. An evolutionary algorithm is specialized for SST-based blending optimization. Optimization of the sequence of ply-drops with the proposed algorithm enables satisfying design guidelines that could not have been considered in previous studies. An extensive set of design guidelines representative of the actual industrial requirements is introduced. The method is applied to an 18-panel benchmark problem from the literature with convincing results. In particular, the present results show that strength-related guidelines can be enforced without significantly penalizing the stiffness behavior and consequently the mass of the structure. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

            "abstract": "To elucidate the dynamics of free (buoyancy-driven) subduction of oceanic lithosphere, I study a model in which a 2-D sheet of viscous fluid with thickness h and viscosity gamma eta(1) subducts in an infinitely deep ambient fluid with viscosity eta(1). Numerical solutions for the sheet&#039;s evolution are obtained using the boundary-element method (BEM), starting from an initial configuration comprising a short &#039;protoslab&#039; attached to a longer horizontal &#039;plate&#039; that is free to move laterally beneath an impermeable traction-free surface. Interpretation of the solutions using thin viscous sheet theory shows that the fundamental length scale controlling the subduction is the &#039;bending length&#039; l(b), defined at each instant as the length of the portion of the sheet&#039;s midsurface where the rate of change of curvature is significant. Geophysically speaking, l(b) is the sum of the lengths of the slab and of the region seaward of the trench where flexural bulging occurs. The bending length in turn enters into the definition of the sheet&#039;s dimensionless &#039;stiffness&#039; S equivalent to gamma(h/l(b))3, which controls whether the sinking speed of the slab is determined by the viscosity of the sheet itself (S 1) or by that of the ambient fluid (S &lt; 1). Motivated by laboratory observations of different modes of subduction (retreating versus advancing trench, folding versus no folding, etc.) in fluid layers with finite depth, I calculate numerically the dip theta(D) of the slab&#039;s leading end as a function of gamma and the normalized depth D/h to which it has penetrated. The contours of the function theta(D)(gamma, D/h) strongly resemble the intermode boundaries in the laboratory-based regime diagram of Schellart, supporting the hypothesis that the mode of subduction observed at long times in experiments is controlled by the dip of the slab&#039;s leading end when it reaches the bottom of the layer. In particular, the BEM solutions explain why trenches advance in the laboratory only when gamma lies in an intermediate range, and why they retreat when gamma is either smaller or larger than this. Application of the BEM model to Wu et al.&#039;s compilation of the minimum curvature radii of subducted slabs suggests gamma is an element of [140, 510] for the Earth. This is too small to permit the laboratory-type &#039;trench advancing&#039; mode, in agreement with the lack of tomographic evidence for slabs that are &#039;bent over backwards&#039;.",

The effects of prebuckling deformations of the shells subjected to a temperature change that is independent of the in-plane coordinates are taken into account in the present analysis. By using the method of power series expansion of continuous displacement components, a set of fundamental governing equations which can take into account the effects of both transverse shear and normal stresses are derived through the principle of virtual work. Several sets of truncated Mth order approximate theories are applied to solve the thermal buckling problems of a simply supported multilayered shell. Critical temperatures are shown for two cases of including the effects of prebuckling displacements and neglecting these effects. The modal stresses can be calculated by integrating the three-dimensional equations of equilibrium in the thickness direction, and satisfying the continuity conditions at the interface between layers and stress boundary conditions at the external surfaces.

Schr??dinger supposedly failed to prove isomorphism, or even a weaker equivalence (&quot;Schr??dinger-equivalence&quot;) of the mathematical structures of the two theories; developments in the early 1930s, especially the work of mathematician von Neumann provided sound proof of mathematical equivalence. The alleged agreement about the Copenhagen Interpretation, predicated to a large extent on this equivalence, was deemed a myth as well. In response, I argue that Schr??dinger&#039;s proof concerned primarily a domain-specific ontological equivalence, rather than the isomorphism or a weaker mathematical equivalence. It stemmed initially from the agreement of the eigenvalues of Wave Mechanics and energy-states of Bohr&#039;s Model that was discovered and published by Schr??dinger in his first and second communications of 1926. Schr??dinger demonstrated in this proof that the laws of motion arrived at by the method of Matrix Mechanics are satisfied by assigning the auxiliary role to eigenfunctions in the derivation of matrices (while he only outlined the reversed derivation of eigenfunctions from Matrix Mechanics, which was necessary for the proof of both isomorphism and Schr??dinger-equivalence of the two theories). This result was intended to demonstrate the domain-specific ontological equivalence of Matrix Mechanics and Wave Mechanics, with respect to the domain of Bohr&#039;s atom. And although the mathematical equivalence of the theories did not seem out of the reach of existing theories and methods, Schr??dinger never intended to fully explore such a possibility in his proof paper. In a further development of Quantum Mechanics, Bohr&#039;s complementarity and Copenhagen Interpretation captured a more substantial convergence of the subsequently revised (in light of the experimental results) Wave and Matrix Mechanics. I argue that both the equivalence and Copenhagen Interpretation can be deemed myths if one predicates the philosophical and historical analysis on a narrow model of physical theory which disregards its historical context, and focuses exclusively on its formal aspects and the exploration of the logical models supposedly implicit in it. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A variety of ensemble studies indicate that the particles gain greater stability during this process, however, it is unknown which material properties of the fragile procapsids change. Using Atomic Force Microscopy-based nano-indentation, we study the development of the mechanical properties during maturation of bacteriophage HK97, a λ-like phage of which the maturation-induced morphological changes are well described. We show that mechanical stabilization and strengthening occurs in three independent ways: (i) an increase of the Young&#039;s modulus, (ii) a strong rise of the capsid&#039;s ultimate strength, and (iii) a growth of the resistance against material fatigue. The Young&#039;s modulus of immature and mature capsids, as determined from thin shell theory, fit with the values calculated using a new multiscale simulation approach. This multiscale calculation shows that the increase in Young&#039;s modulus isn&#039;t dependent on the crosslinking between capsomers. In contrast, the ultimate strength of the capsids does increase even when a limited number of cross-links are formed while full crosslinking appears to protect the shell against material fatigue. Compared to phage λ, the covalent crosslinking at the icosahedral and quasi threefold axes of HK97 yields a mechanically more robust particle than the addition of the gpD protein during maturation of phage λ. These results corroborate the expected increase in capsid stability and strength during maturation, however in an unexpected intricate way, underlining the complex structure of these self-assembling nanocontainers.",

In order to gain a better understanding of its complex and heterogeneous polymeric structure and mechanical properties, we report a computational model of poly(dopamine) by mimicking the polymerization process of the intermediate oxidized product of dopamine, 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), via controlled in silico covalent cross-linking under the two most possible reaction schemes proposed in experiments. To validate our results using experiment, we synthesize poly(dopamine) thin films and perform experimental nanoindentations on the film. We observe an overall linear behavior for Young&#039;s modulus as a function of the degree of cross-linking, demonstrating the possibility of enhancing the mechanical robustness of poly(dopamine) materials by increasing the extent of polymerization. At the highest degree of polymerization considered (70%), the model mimics the linear tetrameric model for poly(dopamine) and melanin. At this degree of polymerization, we find a Young&#039;s modulus of 4.1-4.4 GPa, in agreement with our nanoindentation results of 4.3-10.5 GPa, previous experiments for natural melanin, as well as simulation results for the cyclic tetrameric melanin model (Chen et al., ACS Nano, 2013). Our results suggest that the non-covalent DHI aggregate model might not be appropriate to represent the structure of poly(dopamine) and melanin-like materials, since it gives a much smaller Young&#039;s modulus than the experimental lower bound. Our model not only nicely complements the previous computational work, but also provides new computational tools to study the heterogeneous structural and physicochemical properties of poly(dopamine) and melanin, as well as their formation pathways.",

Specimens consisted of quasi-isotropic graph­ ite/epoxy adherends bonded together with either FM-300 or EC 3445 adhesives. The stacking sequence of the adherends was varied such that 0°, 45°, or 90° plies were present at the adherend-adhesive interfaces. Fatigue damage initiated in the adhesive layer in those specimens with 0° and 45° interface plies. Damage initiated in the form of ply cracking in the strap ·adherend for the specimens with 90° interface plies. The fatigue-damage growth was in the form of delamination within the com­ posite adherends for specimens with the 90° and 45° plies next to the adhesive, while debonding in the adhesive resulted for the specimens with 0° plies next to the adhesive. Those joints with the 0° and 45° plies next to either adhesive had essentially the same fatigue-damage-initia­ tion stress levels. These stress levels were 13 and 71% higher, respec­ tively, than those for specimens with 90° plies next to the EC 3445 and FM-300 adhesives.",

The formulation assumes that the beam can undergo arbitrary kinematical changes while the strains remain small, thus compatibilizing the hypotheses of the strain measure and the constitutive law of the composite material. A key point of the formulation is the development of a pure small strain measure written solely in terms of scalar products of position and director vectors; the latter is accomplished through the obtention of a generalized small strain vector by decomposition of the deformation gradient. The resulting small strain measure is objective under rigid body motion. The finite element implementation of the proposed formulation is simpler than the finite strain theory implementation previously developed by the authors. Numerical experiments show that the present formulation is very accurate and computationally more efficient than the finite strain formulation, thus it is more convenient for most practical applications.",

At some late stage of loading, and before the breaking of fibers in the 0° ply, several other matrix-dominant cracking modes may emerge. All seem to be precipitated by the transverse cracks. The late-stage matrix cracks propagate individually in a stable manner, but can coalesce and thus cause disintegration of the laminate. The objective of this paper is to describe analytically the various cracking events in the cross-ply laminates as they occur during the course of loading. The particular laminates considered belong to the [0 2/90n]1, n = 1, 2 and 4, family. Emphasis is placed on determining why a certain mode of cracking occurs while some other modes do not. Especially for the cracking modes which occur during late-stage loading, an analysis will be made to explain why they are critical to the final strength of the laminate. The analytical results are compared with experiments on laminates made from a graphite-epoxy system.",

Our attention is focused on the local energy release rate along the interlaminar crack front. The two-dimensional multi-layered finite-element method is developed, which employs two-dimensional bending elements of each lamina stacked to represent the laminate. This FEM enables us to easily estimate the energy release rate at any point on the interlaminar crack front. Under the condition of a constant critical energy release rate, we carry out the computational simulation of interlaminar crack extension for the case of a three-layered cross-ply laminate. Simulated extension behavior of interlaminar cracks under increasing indentation load appears to be in good agreement with the experimental observations.",

Res. 20(4): 947–954. 2006.—Fifteen highly trained distance runners (V˙ O2max 71.1 6.0 ml·min1·kg1, mean SD) were randomly assigned to a plyometric training (PLY; n 7) or control (CON; n 8) group. In addition to their normal training, the PLY group undertook 3 30 minutes PLY sessions per week for 9 weeks. Running economy (RE) was assessed during 3 4 minute treadmill runs (14, 16, and 18 km·h1), followed by an incremental test to measure V˙ O2max. Muscle power characteristics were assessed on a portable, unidirectional ground reaction force plate. Compared with CON, PLY improved RE at 18 km·h1 (4.1%, p 0.02), but not at 14 or 16 km·h1. This was accompanied by trends for increased average power during a 5-jump plyometric test (15%, p 0.11), a shorter time to reach maximal dynamic strength during a strength quality assessment test (14%, p 0.09), and a lower V˙ O2-speed slope (14%, p 0.12) after 9 weeks of PLY. There were no significant differences in cardiorespiratory measures or V˙ O2max as a result of PLY.

In this paper we investigate conical singularities that appear on a crumpled sheet and called developable cones (d cones). We found that for a sample of a finite thickness the singularity is never pointlike but has a spatial extension in the form of a crescent. A further deformation of the d cone leads to a transition to a plastic deformation equivalent to a decrease in the singularity size characterized from curvature and profile analysis. The crescent radius of curvature is measured both at small deformations and at large deformations. It is found that, during the buckling process, the curvature of the crescent exhibits two different scalings versus the deformation. From the cone profile, we measured the reaction force of the plate to deformation; and from force measurements, the energy that is necessary to create the singularity is characterized.",

Several empirical models have been conceived to account for this discrepancy, as well as the effect of block sequence. The approach taken here is based on the underlying mechanisms. A cross-ply laminate was used as a model material. In general, composites show both initiatory and progressive mechanisms under fatigue loading. The former is active at high static stresses, whereas the latter predominates at lower stress amplitudes where they are given sufficient time to propagate, Initiatory mechanisms give rise to damage from which the progressive mechanisms can start, and conversely the progressive mechanisms continually alter the local stress state which results in further damage accumulation caused by the initiation controlled mechanisms. In a cross-ply laminate, the initiatory mechanism is the formation of transverse cracks, and the progressive mechanism is mainly delamination growth initiated from the transverse cracks. In an experimental investigation of carbon fiber/epoxy cross-ply laminates, the interaction of these mechanisms has shown why a sequence of high-low amplitude levels results in shorter lifetimes than a low-high order. Such a sequence effect seems to be a common behavior for many other composite materials, and can be mechanistically explained by a similar kind of interaction. Advantages and drawbacks of the mechanistic approach compared with empirical rules are also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In this work, the effect of using a linear elastic or hyperelastic model on the material parameters predicted from indentation bending tests of a thin rubber sheet over a low strain range were studied. An inverse program has been developed based on the Kalman filter method to predict the material properties from experimental tests and to assess the uniqueness of the converged results for different material models. The predicted results were compared to standard tests carried out on the same material. Results showed that the Young&#039;s modulus of the material with the linear elastic model can be accurately predicted while the converged parameters (C\n                        10 and C\n                        01) for the Mooney-Rivlin model were not unique; data analysis showed that parameters C\n                        10 and C\n                        01 of the converged data were associated with the shear modulus of the material. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The fiber composite shell is assumed to be cylindrical and made from T300 graphite fibers embedded in an intermediate-modulus high-strength matrix (IMHS). The residual stresses induced into the laminated structure during the curing are taken into account. The following parameters are investigated: the length and the thickness of the shell, the fiber orientations, the fiber volume fraction, the temperature profile through the thickness of the laminate and the different ply thicknesses. Results obtained indicate that: the fiber orientations and the length of the laminated shell had significant effect on the natural frequencies. The fiber volume fraction, the laminate thickness and the temperature profile through the shell thickness had a weak effect on the natural frequencies. Finally, the laminates with different ply thicknesses had insignificant influence on the behavior of the vibrated laminated shell.",

In particular, the time course of cell morphology, of bead motion and of cortical tension were determined. Here, we introduce a number of mechanistic models for phagocytosis and test their validity by comparing the experimental data with finite element computations for multiple bead sizes. We find that the optimal models involve two key mechanical interactions: a repulsion or pressure between cytoskeleton and free membrane that drives protrusion, and an attraction between cytoskeleton and membrane newly adherent to the bead that flattens the cell into a thin lamella. Other models such as cytoskeletal expansion or swelling appear to be ruled out as main drivers of phagocytosis because of the characteristics of bead motion during engulfment. We finally show that the protrusive force necessary for the engulfment of large beads points towards storage of strain energy in the cytoskeleton over a large distance from the leading edge ( approximately 0.5 microm), and that the flattening force can plausibly be generated by the known concentrations of unconventional myosins at the leading edge.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diaphragmatic reconstruction remains a challenging problem. There is limited information concerning the use of small intestinal submucosa (SIS) in congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair. A canine model was used to evaluate the use of a SIS patch in diaphragmatic reconstruction.\n\nMETHODS: Eleven beagle puppies (1.6-4.2 kg, 8 weeks old) underwent left subcostal laparotomy, central left hemidiaphragm excision (2 x 7 cm, 50% loss), and reconstruction with a 4-ply group I (n = 5) or 8-ply group II (n = 6) SIS patch. Chest radiographs were taken at time of operation and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Animals were killed at 6 months. Adhesion formation (both pleural and abdominal), gross visual evaluation of the patch, and histology were compared.\n\nRESULTS: In group I (4-ply), 1 animal died at 3 months from patch deterioration accompanied by stomach herniation that resulted in respiratory failure. In the 4 remaining animals, chest radiographs showed no evidence of herniation or eventration. On physical examination, there was no evidence of chest wall deformity. During gross surgical examination, the 4-ply patches showed thinning, multiple defects, and liver herniation in 3 animals. In 1 pup, the patch was thickened, intact, well incorporated at the repair site, and adherent to the liver and spleen. In group II (8-ply), 1 animal died of cardiopulmonary failure in the early postoperative period. In the other 5 animals, chest radiographs showed evidence of eventration in 1. On gross examination the patch adhered to the liver in all 5 surviving animals. In 4, the patches were thickened, viable, but had some shrinkage. One patch pulled away from the native diaphragm laterally; however, no visceral herniation was present. In the 1 animal with eventration, there was no evidence of a patch. Adhesion scores (AS) were graded and determined by the sum of extent (0-4), type (0-4), and tenacity (0-3). Average abdominal AS in group I was 5.6 +/- 0.8 vs 10.2 +/- 0.2 (P = .079) for group II. Average lung AS was 0.6 +/- 0.6 in group I vs 3.8 +/- 1.1 (P = .0476) for group II. Histological examination showed group II patches had greater collagen deposition with central calcification and mild inflammation within the residual graft, whereas group I patches were much thinner and were composed of granulation tissue without evidence of residual graft.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that 8-ply SIS repair of diaphragmatic defects was superior (80%; 4/5 to 4-ply, 20%; 1/5, success). Organ adherence appears to be necessary for neovascularization of the SIS composite. Eight-ply grafts appear to be more durable and persist for a longer period, which may improve neovascularization. Long-term follow-up to evaluate remodeling characteristics of the patch material is required.",

The variations in the stiffness coefficients along the meridional direction due to the changes in the ply-angle and the ply-thickness of the filament wound conical shells are incorporated in the finite element formulation. The nonlinear governing equations are solved using the Newton–Raphson iteration procedure coupled with the displacement control method to trace the prebuckling followed by the postbuckling equilibrium path. The presence of asymmetric perturbation in the form of a small magnitude load spatially proportional to the linear buckling mode shape is considered to initiate the bifurcation of the shell deformation.

Mechanisms for crack initiation and growth were studied by optical microscopy. The strain at the onset of transverse cracking, ε\n                        TOS, increased and the slope, K, of the curve of crack density as a function of strain decreased as the G\n                        IC of the matrix increased.

General nonlinear governing equations are given, and the lateral buckling equations are derived by linearizing the nonlinear governing equations. Based on the analytical model, a displacement-based one-dimensional finite element model is developed to formulate the problem. Numerical examples are obtained for thin-walled composite beams with monosymmetric cross-sections and angle-ply laminates. The effects of fiber orientation, location of applied load, modulus ratio, and height-to-span ratio on the lateral buckling load are investigated.

            "abstract": "Deformation and failure mechanisms of textile laminates are strongly affected by mutual shift of the plies. To model arbitrarily stacked laminate within a traditional framework of multi-scale modelling, one must construct a representative volume element (RVE), which includes all the plies. This is a time consuming and computationally expensive work. As an alternative, the paper suggests a technique that allows setting problems on one unit cell of a single ply, i.e. a volume smaller than RVE of the laminate. The technique approximates the stress field in a ply by combination of stress fields obtained in two additional problems. Boundary conditions (BC) in these problems imitate the interaction of the unit cell with surrounding media. Once these problems are solved, the solution for arbitrary number of plies is composed analytically. The proposed technique respects inter-ply configurations, accounts for the number of plies, distinguishes the ply position, and reproduces the meso stress state with a good accuracy. The technique is validated against reference solutions obtained for the entire laminate. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Forming simulation results indicate that stitch placement cannot be optimised intuitively to avoid forming defects. A genetic algorithm has been developed to optimise the stitch pattern, minimising shear deformation in multi-ply stitched preforms. The quality of the shear angle distribution has been assessed using a maximum value criterion (MAXVC) and a Weibull distribution quantile criterion (WBLQC). Both criteria are suitable for local stitch optimisation, producing acceptable solutions towards the global optimum. The convergence rate is higher for MAXVC, while WBLQC is more effective for finding a solution closer to the global optimum. The derived solutions show that optimised patterns of through-thickness stitches can improve the formability of multi-ply preforms compared with an unstitched reference case, as strain re-distribution homogenises the shear angles in each ply.",

This availability has exploded at least partly due to the arrival of dissimilar material interfaces and thin films and the ease with which microfabrication techniques apply to silicon technology. Having an eye toward those tests utilized for thin films, this paper reviews only a few of these techniques. The emphasis is on measuring thin film adhesion from the standpoint of fracture mechanics, when the film is mechanically or by other means removed from the substrate, and the amount of energy necessary for this process is calculated per unit area of the removed film. This tends to give values approaching the true work of adhesion at small thickness and greater values of the practical work of adhesion at larger thickness, all being in the 30-30,000 nm range. The resulting large range of toughnesses is shown to be dependent on the scale of plasticity achieved as controlled by film thickness, microstructure, chemistry and test temperature. While the tests reviewed largely address the measurement of elastic strain energy release rates, we also briefly address a few theoretical models which are specific to the resistance side of the delamination equation. The weight of the evidence suggests for ductile metallic films that the major extrinsic variables are film stress, extent of delamination, thickness and temperature while the major intrinsic ones are modulus, yield strength, the thermodynamic work of adhesion and one or more length scales. For some 25 film/substrate multilayers, with emphasis on Al, Au and Cu, the comparison of several theoretical models as to how the extrinsic and intrinsic variables intertwine is made. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc.",

In particular, there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials are analytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we review the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss many applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape invariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have the property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape invariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar potentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering, isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry ideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well potential and for improving large $N$ expansions. We also discuss the problem of a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we discuss structures more general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a para-fermion of order $p$.",

The variational asymptotic method is used to formulate the force-deformation relationships equations accounting for the presence of active SMA fibers distributed along the cross-section of the beam. The constitutive relationships for evaluation of the properties of a hybrid SMA composite ply are obtained following the rule of mixtures. The analytical expressions of the actuation components for the active beam are derived based on Tanaka’s constitutive equation and Lin’s linear phase transformation kinetics for SMA fiber. The general form of constitutive relation is applied to the cases of extension-twist coupling, corresponding to Circumferentially Uniform (CUS) and bending-twist coupling, corresponding to Circumferentially Anti-Symmetric (CAS). The present analysis extends the previous work done for modeling generic passive thin-walled laminated beams. Numerical results show that significant extension, bending and twisting deflection occur during the phase transformation due to SMA actuation. The effects of temperature on structural response behavior during phase transformation from martensite to austenite are significant. The effects of the volume fraction of the SMA fiber, the martensitic residual strain and ply angle are also addressed.",

Experts from mechanics measure stress/ strain relations, using the so-called triaxial tests, and then use these data to predict the behavior of a sample under given boundary conditions. Some physicists have a different view: they have claimed that it is not possible to define a proper displacement field in a heap of sand, and that the notion of strains is thus ambiguous. In the present text, we conclude that the crucial features are the following: (a) a heap is usually formed from a flowing phase of sand, (b) there is (empirically) a sharp interface between the flowing phase and the frozen heap below, (c) we may define for each grain a displacement, which is measured from the moment when it froze. (This displacement is due, for instance, to a compaction of the heap under its own weight.) We also present some aspects of the dynamics, including dune motions and surface flows of grains. Bouchaud, Cates and coworkers have constructed a very compact description for thin flows. We discuss the practical consequences of this picture, emphasizing some possible extensions for thicker flows. This suggests a number of possible experiments on avalanches.",

Preparation and operating parameters namely polymer types facing to the feed stream, NaOH treatment for the regeneration of chitosan, and crosslinking system types were investigated using the factorial design method. It was shown that these parameters were all critical to the performance of the membrane in the form of the main and interaction effects. The pervaporation performance of the two-ply membrane with its sodium alginate layer facing the feed side and crosslinked or insolubilized in sulfuric acid solution was compared with the pure sodium alginate and the chitosan membranes in terms of the flux and separation factors. It was shown that although its flux was lower than that of the pure sodium alginate and chitosan membranes, the separation factors at various alcohol concentrations were in between values for the two pure membranes. For the dehydration of 90wt% isopropanol-water mixtures the performance of the two-ply membrane which was moderately crosslinked in formaldehyde was found to match the high performance of the pure sodium alginate membrane. This two-ply membrane had fluxes of 70g/m2h at 95% EtOH, 554g/m2h at 90% PrOH and separation factors of 1110 at 95% EtOH, 2010 at 90% PrOH and its mechanical properties were better than that of the pure sodium alginate membrane.

The COD as a function of the constraint effect of adjacent layers and crack spacing is described by a simple power law. The crack closure technique and Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the damage evolution: the 90-layer is divided into a large number of elements and the critical strain energy rate Gc having the Weibull distribution is randomly assigned to each element. The crash density data for a [0(2)/90(4)](s) cross plan laminate are used to determine the Weibull parameters. The simulated crack density curves are combined with the CDM stiffness reduction predictions to obtain the stiffness versus strain.

The physical mechanisms involved in the process are discussed and those mechanisms that affect the final state are identified, viz., centrifugal and viscous forces, solute diffusion, and solvent evaporation: A model is proposed that incorporates only the latter mechanisms, with viscosity and diffusivity depending on solute concentration. The evaporation of solvent during spinning causes the solution viscosity to increase and the flow is reduced. The thickness of the final solid film is related to the thickness of a diffusion boundary layer near the free surface. The model predicts the final dry film thickness in terms of the primary process variables, spin speed, and initial polymer concentration. A similarity boundary‐layer analysis leads to a simple approximate result for the final film thickness that is consistent with limited experimental data, h ∼ K C0 (ν0 D0)^1/4 / Ω^1/2, where K is a number of order unity and the other quantities are, respectively, the initial polymer concentration, the kinematic viscosity, the solute diffusivity, and the spin speed. The dependence on diffusivity has not previously been described theoretically. The total spin time is shown to be proportional to Ω− 1, in agreement with experiment. The rate of solvent evaporation is shown to be proportional to Ω, which contradicts previous assumptions.",

            "abstract": "Fracture mechanics considers conditions for the onset, propagation, and arrest of shear and tensile ruptures. Because earthquakes can be naturally represented as elastodynamic shear instabilities, fracture mechanics forms a theoretical basis of earthquake seismology. Earthquake ruptures involve a number of mechanical processes, including yielding and material breakdown around the propagating rupture front, complex time-dependent evolution of friction on a slipping interface behind the rupture front, radiation of seismic waves, wear, communition, and heating of the fault zone material, etc. These processes are intrinsically coupled, and must be considered in a unified fashion. Recent theoretical, experimental, and field data suggest that fracture mechanics models assuming small-scale yielding and constant residual friction on a fault surface may not be an adequate theoretical description of earthquake ruptures. This is because the fault interface may undergo a continuous weakening with rapid slip (e.g., due to thermal effects), so that the effective displacement corresponding to fault weakening may (1) scale with the rupture length and (2) be non-negligible compared to the overall coseismic offset. Also, an assumption that the inelastic yielding is confined to the slip plane is likely violated, especially at high rupture speeds approaching the shear wave velocity. It follows that the earthquake fracture energy is expected to scale with the rupture size, and may not be a negligible part of the earthquake energy balance, perhaps even for large earthquakes. In the presence of significant variations in the dynamic friction during fault slip, a distinction between the fracture energy and the energy loss due to friction is not well defined. Both terms represent inelastic work done on a fault that is ultimately spent on fracturing, communition, and heating of the fault zone material. If the fracture energy is formally defined as work required to evolve friction from the maximum static level in the breakdown zone at the rupture front to the minimum dynamic level, a continuous dynamic weakening implies repartitioning of the total inelastic work between the fracture energy and the &#039;residual&#039; frictional losses. The coseismic heating is one of the likely mechanisms that control the dynamic fault strength, and thus the stress drop and seismic radiation. The instantaneous along-fault temperature distribution is governed by the details of slip history, as well as the characteristic thickness and thermophysical properties of a slipping zone. Faults that are thin compared to the thermal diffusion length scale are predicted to produce maximum temperatures near the rupture front, while thicker faults are likely hottest in the central part of the rupture. These patterns may affect the rupture dynamics. Theoretical models that fully couple heat transfer, thermally activated friction, elastodynamics, and off-fault damage may be necessary for realistic simulations of earthquake ruptures. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

            "abstract": "A micromechanics study is presented of the matrix cracking behavior of laminated, fiber-reinforced ceramic cross-ply composites when subject to tensile stressing parallel to fibers in the 0-degrees plies. Cracks extending across the 90-degrees plies are assumed to exist, having developed at relatively low tensile stresses by the tunnel cracking mechanism. The problem addressed in this study is the subsequent extension of these intital cracks into and across the 0-degrees plies. Of special interest is the relation between the stress level at which the matrix cracks are able to extend all the way through the 0-degrees plies and the well known matrix cracking stress for steady-state crack extension through a uni-directional fiber-reinforced composite. Depending on the initial crack distribution in the 90-degrees plies, this stress level can be as large as the uni-directional matrix cracking stress or it can be as low as about one half that value. The cracking process involves a competition between crack bridging by the fibers in the 0-degrees plies and interaction among multiple cracks. Crack bridging is modeled by a line-spring formulation where the nonlinear springs characterize the sliding resistance between fibers and matrix. Crack interaction is modeled by two representative doubly periodic crack patterns, one with collinear arrays and the other with staggered arrays. Material heterogeneity and anisotropy are addressed, and it is shown that a homogeneous, isotropic average approximation can be employed. In addition to conditions for matrix cracking, the study provides results which enable the tensile stress-strain behavior of the cross-ply to be predicted, and it provides estimates of the maximum stress concentration in the bridging fibers.

            "abstract": "The rough, hairy surfaces of many insects and spiders serve to render them water-repellent; consequently, when submerged, many are able to survive by virtue of a thin air layer trapped along their exteriors. The diffusion of dissolved oxygen from the ambient water may allow this layer to function as a respiratory bubble or &#039;plastron&#039;, and so enable certain species to remain underwater indefinitely. Maintenance of the plastron requires that the curvature pressure balance the pressure difference between the plastron and ambient. Moreover, viable plastrons must be of sufficient area to accommodate the interfacial exchange Of 02 and C02 necessary to meet metabolic demands. By coupling the bubble mechanics, surface and gas-phase chemistry, we enumerate criteria for plastron viability and thereby deduce the range of environmental conditions and dive depths over which plastron breathers can survive. The influence of an external flow on plastron breathing is also examined. Dynamic pressure may become significant for respiration in fast-flowing, shallow and well-aerated streams. Moreover, flow effects are generally significant because they sharpen chemical gradients and so enhance mass transfer across the plastron interface. Modelling this process provides a rationale for the ventilation movements documented in the biology literature, whereby arthropods enhance plastron respiration by flapping their limbs or antennae.

            "abstract": "The compressive stability of anti-symmetric angle-ply laminated plates with particular reference to the degrading influence of membrane-flexural coupling is reported in this paper. The degree of membrane-flexural coupling in the laminated composite plates is varied, essentially, by altering the ply-angle and the number of plies in the laminated stack for a given composite material system. The coupled compressive buckling solutions are determined in the paper using the finite strip method of analysis and the buckling displacement fields of the strip formulation are those which are able to provide zero in-plane normal movement at the edge boundaries of the laminated plates. Results are given for anti-symmetric angle-ply laminated plates subjected to uniaxial compression and these have been obtained from fully converged finite strip structural models. Validation of the finite strip formulation is indicated in the paper through comparisons with exact solutions where appropriate. Increasing the number of plies in the laminated system is seen to reduce the degree of coupling and the critical stress levels are noted to tend towards the plate orthotropic solutions. The ply-angle corresponding to the optimised buckling stress for any particular laminate is noted in the paper to be influenced by the support boundary conditions at the plates unloaded edges. For any particular laminate the minimum critical buckling stress and corresponding natural half-wavelength of the buckling mode are shown to be highly sensitive to ply-angle variation. Some post-buckling results are presented in the paper and these have been determined using the finite element method of analysis. The influence of membrane-flexural coupling is shown to be significant throughout the compressive post-buckling history of the laminated plates. The optimised ply-angle with regard to the critical compressive buckling stress of square simply supported anti-symmetric angle-ply laminates is shown to be less effective in the post-buckling range with regard to post-buckled compressional stiffness. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In stiffness critical structures, the loss of stiffness and/ or change in CTE may result in the loss of structural functionality. These matrix-dominated failure modes can lead to delamination and fiber breakage in highly loaded plies and eventually to failure of the laminate. It is vitally important that predictive methods are developed that will be accepted, following thorough validation, by the composites engineering community. This paper is one attempt to achieve sound validation for four different methods of prediction, one of which is finite-element analysis. The three distinct cross-ply laminate models discussed here have been shown to be consistent with each other, and with FEA predictions. Additionally, model predictions for the effective moduli of transversely cracked laminates have been shown to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. The excellent correlation of the model predictions and the agreement with experimental data provides the basis for these models to be seriously considered for use in the development of new design tools and procedures.

All mussels produced faeces but not pseudofaeces indicating that algae were not rejected prior to ingestion. Digestive glands showed ingestion of the algae and hemocyte infiltration after 3 days of exposure, whereas mantle tissue did not show differences between treatments. As the effects of K. veneficum were not observed in the mantle tissue it can be hypothesized that the algal concentration was not high enough, or exposure long enough, to affect all the tissues. Despite being in culture for more than 50 years the original K. veneficum isolate obtained by Mary Parke still showed toxic effects on mussels.",

The impact response and the damage process of cross-ply laminated plates with grouped ([03/903]s and [903/03]s) and interspersed ([0/90]3s) ply stacking was simulated using a FE model developed by the authors in a previous study and the numerical results were compared to experimental observations. The model provided a correct simulation of size, shape and location of the principal fracture modes occurring in impacted [03/903]s and [903/03]s laminates. In [0/90]3s laminates, characterized by a complex spatial damage distribution, the model was able to predict the approximately circular shape of the overall projected damage area and to capture the typical shape features of individual delaminations; significant discrepancies between experiments and predictions were however observed in terms of delamination sizes at single interfaces. Further investigations are needed to clarify the main reasons of these discrepancies. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "In gas exchangers, the tissue barrier, the partition that separates the respiratory media (water/air and hemolymph/blood), is exceptional for its remarkable thinness, striking strength, and vast surface area. These properties formed to meet conflicting roles: thinness was essential for efficient flux of oxygen by passive diffusion, and strength was crucial for maintaining structural integrity. What we have designated as &quot;three-ply&quot; or &quot;laminated tripartite&quot; architecture of the barrier appeared very early in the evolution of the vertebrate gas exchanger. The design is conspicuous in the water-blood barrier of the fish gills through the lungs of air-breathing vertebrates, where the plan first appeared in lungfishes (Dipnoi) some 400 million years ago. The similarity of the structural design of the barrier in respiratory organs of animals that remarkably differ phylogenetically, behaviorally, and ecologically shows that the construction has been highly conserved both vertically and horizontally, i.e., along and across the evolutionary continuum. It is conceivable that the blueprint may have been the only practical construction that could simultaneously grant satisfactory strength and promote gas exchange. In view of the very narrow allometric range of the thickness of the blood-gas barrier in the lungs of different-sized vertebrate groups, the measurement has seemingly been optimized. There is convincing, though indirect, evidence that the extracellular matrix and particularly the type IV collagen in the lamina densa of the basement membrane is the main stress-bearing component of the blood-gas barrier. Under extreme conditions of operation and in some disease states, the barrier fails with serious consequences. The lamina densa which in many parts of the blood-gas barrier is &lt;50 nm thin is a lifeline in the true sense of the word.",

Blisters may grow by interfacial fracture, a process which, under the appropriate conditions, may result in the catastrophic failure of the component. Blisters are often observed to adopt convoluted-even bizarre shapes and to fold into intricate patterns. Some developments based on the use of direct methods of the calculus of variations, which have proven useful for understanding the mechanics of folding of thin films are reviewed. Preferred growth directions have been reported in films grown epitaxially on crystallographic planes. These cords may branch forming webs of regular geometries. The experimental evidence suggests that the direction of the cords in these arrays is determined by the anisotropy of the state of stress in the film, which favors cords that are perpendicular to the axis of highest compressive stress. It is found that a boundary-layer analysis permits one to assign a well-defined width to the sharp edges exhibited by the membrane solution. This width sets the minimum spacing between folds, and is found to correlate closely with the wavelength of the boundary undulations observed in large blisters. The energetics of blister growth and growth of telephone-cord blister are also described.",

            "abstract": "The Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering of the US Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored a workshop to identify cutting-edge research needs and opportunities, enabled by the application of theoretical and applied mechanics. The workshop also included input from biochemical, surface science, and computational disciplines, on approaching scientific issues at the nanoscale, and the linkage of atomistic-scale with nano-, meso-, and continuum-scale mechanics. This paper is a summary of the outcome of the workshop, consisting of three main sections, each put together by a team of workshop participants. Section 1 addresses research opportunities that can be realized by the application of mechanics fundamentals to the general area of self-assembly, directed self-assembly, and fluidics. Section 2 examines the role of mechanics in biological, bioinspired, and biohybrid material systems, closely relating to and complementing the material covered in Section 1. In this manner, it was made dear that mechanics plays a fundamental role in understanding the biological functions at all scales, in seeking to utilize biology and biological techniques to develop new materials and devices, and in the general area of bionanotechnology. While direct observational investigations are an essential ingredient of new discoveries and will continue to open new exciting research doors, it is the basic need for controlled experimentation and fundamentally-based modeling and computational simulations that will be truly empowered by a systematic use of the fundamentals of mechanics. Section 3 brings into focus new challenging issues in inelastic deformation and fracturing of materials that have emerged as a result of the development of nanodevices, biopolymers, and hybrid bio-abio systems. Each section begins with some introductory overview comments, and then provides illustrative examples that were presented at the workshop and which are believed to highlight the enabling research areas and, particularly, the impact that mechanics can make in enhancing the fundamental understanding that can lead to new technologies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A finite element analysis is performed to include a gradient enhanced continuum damage theory since a non-local theory has to be used when stress gradients are present. Despite the anisotropic nature of paper materials, each layer is modeled as isotropic and homogenous where material parameters are estimated from the in-plane properties of the paper sheet. The two failure modes, material failure and delamination between top and base layer is analyzed within the frameworks of fracture and continuum damage mechanics. Delamination is assumed to be in shearing mode since the crack surfaces are predominantly sliding and crack opening is vanishing. An analytic solution for the fracture energy release rate is derived utilizing engineering beam theory assuming small deformations. Different combinations of stiffness and thickness ratios between the top and base layer are examined in order to judge the risk for having material failure or delamination failure of the multi-ply linerboard. Having a thick and weak top layer, compared to the base layer, increases the probability to obtain through-thickness damage failure in favor of delamination. On the other hand, having a stiff and thin top layer, compared to the base layer, increases the probability to obtain delamination prior to rupture of the top layer. Experiments performed on two-ply linerboards consisting of one ply of mainly virgin fibers and one ply of recycled fibers confirm the predictions made by the model.",

The cracks parallel to the fiber direction are extended over the full thickness of transverse plies and often cross the entire test specimen width. It is widely recognized that the changes of laminate thermomechanical constants, caused by the transverse cracking of composite laminates, can be significant. Theoretical stress analysis in the cross ply laminates in the vicinity of cracks is performed using numerical (FE) and analytical methods. The effect of transverse cracks on the degradation of elastic properties will be discussed in Part 2 [1]. Approximate analytical micromechanical models based on shear lag predictions, variational analysis, and numerical 2D finite element calculations were verified in their predictive abilities. The three variational models used are based on the principle of minimum complementary energy and have different degrees of accuracy with respect to the stress assumptions used (Hashin&#039;s, 2D 0° and 2D 0°/90° models). Using FEM, the plane stress and strain state were analyzed. The effect of material properties and layer thickness on the stress distribution in a 90° layer was evaluated by varying the crack spacing. The crack opening displacement (COD), normalized with respect to the far field strain, is proposed as a measure of reduction of the mechanical properties. Since the CODs are rather insensitive to the crack spacing (crack density) in a wide region, they will be used in modeling the stiffness reduction in these laminates [1].",

The three sections describe the determination of arterial mechanical properties using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), a constitutive relation for the arterial wall, and finite element method (FEM) models of the arterial wall and atheroma. METHODS: Inflation testing of porcine left anterior descending coronary arteries was conducted. The changes in the vessel geometry were monitored using IVUS, and intracoronary pressure was recorded using a pressure transducer. The creep and quasistatic stress/strain responses were determined. A Standard Linear Solid (SLS) was modified to reproduce the non-linear elastic behavior of the arterial wall. This Standard Non-linear Solid (SNS) was implemented into an axisymetric thick-walled cylinder numerical model. Finite element analysis models were created for five age groups and four levels of stenosis using the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis Youth (PDAY) database. RESULTS: The arteries exhibited non-linear elastic behavior. The total tissue creep strain was epsilon creep = 0.082 +/- 0.018 mm/mm. The numerical model could reproduce both the non-linearity of the porcine data and time dependent behavior of the arterial wall found in the literature with a correlation coefficient of 0.985. Increasing age had a strong positive correlation with the shoulder stress level, (r = 0.95). The 30% stenosis had the highest shoulder stress due to the combination of a fully formed lipid pool and a thin cap. CONCLUSIONS: Studying the solid mechanics of the arterial wall and the atheroma provide important insights into the mechanisms involved in plaque rupture.",

Thus characterization of interfacial properties is critical for material selection and process control. Conventional methods for interfacial adhesion and fracture toughness measurements are generally based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. More detailed local measurements are required to fully characterize the interfaces based on a nonlinear cohesive interface model. With the experimentally determined interfacial properties, cohesive interface modeling can be set up to predict the initiation and evolution of interfacial failure in chip-package systems. In this study, two model systems are considered by approaches of both linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and cohesive interface modeling (CIM). First, for a brittle thin film on a compliant substrate, the initiation and propagation of delamination from the root of a channel crack is simulated. The effects of the cohesive strength and fracture toughness of the interface on channel cracking of thin films on compliant substrates are analyzed. Second, a four-point bend test is considered, in comparison with experimental measurements of the local crack opening displacements.",

The analysis has given a closed ABSTRACT The mechanics aspects of the peel test are analyzed. In this analysis, the limitation and form solution for the partitioning of peel strength between the energy expenditure rate for the decohesion process and the internal work expenditure rate caused by plastic deformation (bending) of the film. The results predicted the variation of peel strength as a function of the film thickness, the film yield stress and the compliance of the substrate. This analysis shows that the peel strength is very sensitive to the thickness of the film and the yield stress of the film. As observed in the experiment, the peel strength has a peak value at a certain thickness of the film. This is explained for both L and T peel tests. Unlike the L peel test, the peak phenomenon in the T peel test (of metallic films) is due to the hardening of the adhered film. Secondly, the effect of plasticity and viscoelasticity in the peel test of thin polymer films is analyzed. Unlike the peel test of metallic films, tension and shear effect of the film deformation is very important in the analysis of the polymer peel test. An integral equation is formulated for the viscoelastic models of the adhered film. The solution of the integral equation reveals the important parameters in polymer peeling and their contribution to the peel force as well as to the viscoelastic dissipation. In addition, the meaning of the interface toughness is reexamined and the interface toughness is evaluated by the peel test. Based on these analyses, a Universal Peel Diagram has been constructed, which accounts for the hardening behavior of the film. On this diagram, objective interfacial decohesion toughness can be readily obtained using very simple peel tests. The analysis includes not only the 900 peel test but also the general angle peel test. Comparison between the theory and experiment has been made with the experimental data provided by J. Kim of IBM. The comparison shows good agreement.",

Two of the composite materials consist of fibreglass and vinylester resin, but with different fibre contents and ply lay?up. The third is made of fibreglass and polyester resin. This study investigated the effects of specimen geometry and crush speed on the specific energy absorption of these composite materials. It was found that for specimens showing stable crushing, greater thickness lends to reduce the specific energy absorption; square tubes have less specific energy absorption than circular tubes, and greater cone angle results in lower specific energy. Crushing speed does not have significant effect on the specific energy absorption of thin?walled circular or square tubes made of the three kinds of composite materials. However, specific energy of thin?walled circular conical specimens made of polyester resin and random chopped strand mat of glass fibre were reduced by some 35% under a crushing speed of about 21 m/s. It is also clear from this study that at higher crush speeds the crushing mechanisms of tubular specimens with large thickness differ from the static cases.",

            "abstract": "The wrinkling and delamination of stiff thin films adhered to a polymer substrate have important applications in &quot;flexible electronics.&quot; The resulting periodic structures, when used for circuitry, have remarkable mechanical properties because stretching or twisting of the substrate is mostly accommodated through bending of the film, which minimizes fatigue or fracture. To date, applications in this context have used substrate patterning to create an anisotropic substrate-film adhesion energy, thereby producing a controlled array of delamination &quot;blisters.&quot; However, even in the absence of such patterning, blisters appear spontaneously, with a characteristic size. Here, we perform well-controlled experiments at macroscopic scales to study what sets the dimensions of these blisters in terms of the material properties and explain our results by using a combination of scaling and analytical methods. Besides pointing to a method for determining the interfacial toughness, our analysis suggests a number of design guidelines for the thin films used in flexible electronic applications. Crucially, we show that, to avoid the possibility that delamination may cause fatigue damage, the thin film thickness must be greater than a critical value, which we determine.",

In the framework of this method, an analysis of local stresses that are responsible for the coalescence of matrix cracks is carried out by using a multi-fiber unit cell model and finite element method. The random distribution of fibers, fiber–matrix decohesion and matrix plastic deformations are taken into account in the micromechanical simulations. The present study also shows that the nonlinear hardening behavior of matrix reflects more realistically the influence of plastic deformations on the in situ transverse strength of lamina than the perfectly plastic behavior of matrix. The prediction of the in situ transverse strength is verified against the experimental data for a cross ply laminate subjected to uniaxial tension.",

A 2-D shear lag method is used to determine stresses in a laminate representative segment containing one crack and two crack tip delaminations. For the calculation of the strain-energy release rate (SERR) associated with delaminations, the damaged layer is replaced with an equivalent homogeneous one with effective elastic properties. Closed-form expressions for the total SERR and its mode I and mode II components as a linear function of the first partial derivatives of the effective elastic properties of the damaged layer with respect to delamination area are derived. Dependence of SERRs and the laminate stiffness properties on delamination area, crack density and ply orientation angle is examined for balanced [O2/??2/-??2]5 and unbalanced [O2/??2]5 carbon/ epoxy laminates. The total SERR obtained in this study is compared to a simple closed-form expression for a uniform local delamination derived in earlier work by O&#039;Brien (Local delamination in laminates with angle-ply matrix cracks: Part II Delamination Fracture Analysis and Fatigue Characterization. NASA Technical Memorandum 104076/AVS-COM Technical Report 91-B-011). It appears that matrix crack density and delamination size influence the SERR value significantly. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is found that the bonding flaws with large size are prone to cause severe deviation of defect growth, leading to a non-transferred area of thin layer when splitting. In a practical Smart-Cut process where the internal pressure of bonding flaws is very small, large interfacial defects always promote defect growth in the splitting process. Meanwhile, increasing the internal pressure of the bonding flaws decreases the defect growth and its deviation before splitting. The mechanism of relaxation of stiffener constraint is proposed to clarify the effect of bonding flaws. Moreover, the progress of the splitting process is analyzed when bonding flaws are present. After splitting, those bonding flaws with large size and high internal pressure are vulnerable for the blistering of the thin film during high-temperature annealing. © 2008 The Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Springer-Verlag GmbH.",

To validate the new model, a comparative finite element method (FEM) analysis is carried out in which: (a) the plain-woven single-ply fabric is modeled using conventional shell elements and weaving is done in an explicit manner by snaking the yarns through the fabric and (b) the fabric is treated as a planar continuum surface composed of conventional shell elements to which the new meso-scale unit-cell based material model is assigned. The results obtained show that the material model provides a reasonably good description for the fabric deformation and fracture behavior under different combinations of fixed and free boundary conditions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",

The presence of the urethane in the transverse plies increases the applied strains necessary for the initiation and development of transverse cracking during the extension of both hybrid matrix and uniform matrix laminates.

            "abstract": "In the present paper an attempt is made to describe transverse cracking of cross-ply ([0??n/90??m]s) laminates subjected to an external applied load and a temperature change. For this purpose a new method is suggested which was developed on the basis of the energy balance based finite fracture criterion suggested by Hashin (1996) [Hashin, Z., 1996. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 44, 1129]. In this approach the value of the specific surface energy (the critical energy release rate) is assumed to be dependent on a random microdamage distribution in the material. Hence, it is assumed to be a random function of location. A new probabilistic technique is developed to take this randomness into consideration. It is shown that only one unknown probabilistic function is required, namely the probability density function of the specific surface energy. This is determined by fitting the external stress and the corresponding crack density to experimental data for any specific laminated system. The cracking process for any other laminate made of the same material may be predicted by the suggested method. Numerical simulation of progressive cracking process is described, which provides the probability density function for inter-crack distances as well as the crack density growth with increasing external loading. A simple probabilistic progressive cracking criterion is developed as well. The predicted crack density growth calculated for various laminates is in good agreement with published experimental results. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

We use a recently developed experimental technique for quantifying the mechanics of confluent cell sheets. Living cells are cultured on a thin film of polystyrene [PS], which is attached to a patterned substrate of crosslinked poly(dimethyl siloxane) [PDMS] microwells. As cells attach to the substrate and begin to form a sheet, they apply sufficient contractile force to buckle the PS film over individual microwells to form a microlens array. The curvature for each microlens is measured by confocal microscopy and can be related to the strain and stress applied by the cell sheet using simple mechanical analysis for the buckling of thin films. We demonstrate that this technique can provide insight into the important materials properties and length scales that govern cell sheet responses, especially the role of stiffness of the substrate. We show that intercellular forces can lead to significantly different behaviors than the ones observed for individual cells, where focal adhesion is the relevant parameter.",

The measurements are based on the application of the ultrasonic point-source/point-receiver technique (PS/PR) using either a focused laser beam operating as a dipole source or a small aperture, piezoceramic shear transducer serving as a monopole source. Detection of the signals is with a piezoceramic sensor that directly responds to the lateral or shear motions of the specimen surface. The detected time signals represent the detailed spatial and temporal characteristics of the elastic wave field. The experimental group velocity data is analyzed using a simple plane-wave, plane-stress model that describes the propagation of quasi-longitudinal and quasi-transverse membrane waves in the plane of the plate. We demonstrate in this paper the strength of the PS/PR measurement technique when coupled with appropriate signal processing to recover the stiffness tensor of thin, fiber-reinforced laminates. Additionally, preliminary experimental results on the detection of flaws in thin specimens from in-situ measurements are included. (Author abstract) 18 Refs.",

Associated circumferential and axial stretches were typically &lt;20%, indicating &quot;adventitiosclerosis.&quot; Adventitias behaved nearly elastically for both loading domains, demonstrating high tensile strengths (&gt;1 MPa). The anisotropic and strongly nonlinear mechanical responses were represented appropriately by two-dimensional Fung-type stored-energy functions. At physiological pressure (13.3 kPa), adventitias carry ~25% of the pressure load in situ, whereas their circumferential and axial stresses were similar to the total wall stresses (~50 kPa in both directions), supporting a &quot;uniform stress hypothesis.&quot; At higher pressures, they became the mechanically predominant layer, carrying &gt;50% of the pressure load.

We begin with a description of the growth modes of films and relate the different structures to the thermodynamic driving forces and to kinetics. The influence of misfit strain, surface free energies, and interface energies are discussed in detail. In particular, we treat the instability of a moving crystal-vapor surface resulting from stress, and the stabilizing influence of step energies in the case where the surface is coincident with a low-index orientation below its surface roughening transition temperature. The introduction of defects by strain, high growth rates, and shadowing instabilities are described. A Monte Carlo model of Al is developed; the model parameters are derived from molecular dynamics calculations of atomic level energetics and kinetics. Anisotropies in surface energies and surface mobilities are found to be large, and have a strong influence on film structures. An extension of the model to polycrystalline films is included. Some of the issues involved in metallization of silicon devices are discussed using results from this model. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

One class of experiments was conducted on organic thin films, load-displacement curves being acquired by atomic force microscopy using custom-designed tips. Another class of experiments focused on well-defined crystalline and mechanically polished ceramic substrates probed by a traditional nanoindenter. We observed the first-loading cycle to be considerably affected by surface roughness. Plastic failure was found to dominate incipient contact while contact stiffness increased on decreasing fractal dimension and roughness. Our findings suggest fractal parameters to drive contact mechanics whenever the penetration depth is kept below the interface width.",

Contrary to what seems to be the general belief expressed in the literature, this limiting process gives a perfectly well-defined result, provided that we take some simple precautions in the definition of the potentials and wave functions. It can then be shown that the wave function splits into two parts: the normal part, which contains the infinite energies required by the uncertainty principle, and a tangent part which contains &quot;surface potentials&quot; depending both on the Gaussian and mean curvatures. An immediate consequence of these results is the existence of different quantum mechanical properties for two isometric surfaces, as can be seen from the bound state which appears along the edge of a folded (but not stretched) plane. The fact that this surface potential is not a bending invariant (cannot be expressed as a function of the components of the metric tensor and their derivatives) is also interesting from the more general point of view of the quantum mechanics in curved spaces, since it can never be obtained from the classical Lagrangian of an a priori constrained particle without substantial modifications in the usual quantization procedures. Similar calculations are also presented for the case of a particle bounded to a curve. The properties of the constraining spatial potential, necessary to a meaningful limiting process, are discussed in some detail, and, as expected, the resulting Schrödinger equation contains a &quot;linear potential&quot; which is a function of the curvature.",

Here, we investigate self-assembly processes driven by wetting interactions to shape the contour of a functional, nonplanar photovoltaic (PV) device. A mechanics model based on the theory of thin plates is developed to identify the critical conditions for self-folding of different 2D geometrical shapes. This strategy is demonstrated for specifically designed millimeter-scale silicon objects, which are self-assembled into spherical, and other 3D shapes and integrated into fully functional light-trapping PV devices.

To this end, a semi-analytical Rayleigh–Ritz approach is first developed to calculate the critical buckling loads of square composite laminates with SFSF (S: simply-support, F: free) boundary conditions. Then, these laminates are simulated under axially compression loading using the commercial finite element software, ABAQUS. Critical buckling loads and failure modes are predicted by both eigenvalue linear and nonlinear analysis in conjunction with three well-known failure criteria, i.e., Hashin, Tsai-Wu and Tsai-Hill criteria. To validate the analytical and numerical results, layups of [0°/90°]s, [±30°]s and [±45°]s are tested under uniaxial buckling load. Since there is no standard for buckling test of composite plates with simply-supported boundary conditions, a new test setup is designed. Results showed that nonlinear finite element analysis predicts the critical bucking loads of multidirectional laminates with a good accuracy in comparison to experiments. In addition, non-linear finite element analysis associated with the Tsai-Wu and Tsai-Hill failure criteria are more efficient in prediction of buckling modes of failure in comparison to the Hashin criterion.",

Two-ply sheet metals are generally composed of metals that have different mechanical properties. Thus the forming process of these materials is complicated. The forming characteristics in hole flanging with ironing for two-ply sheet metals were studied. An explosively welded Al/Cu bi-metallic sheet metal was used as a model material throughout the experiments. The thickness of the matrix A1 was 2.20 mm and that of the cladding Cu was 0.83 mm. A number of experiments were performed using a conical punch with a cone angle of 45°. The experimental results were compared with FEM-simulated results, from which it was demonstrated that the rigid–plastic FEM can be used effectively for predicting the forming process and the finished shape of bi-metallic sheet metals.",

This theory generalizes standard crystal elasticity to curved monolayer lattices by means of the exponential Cauchy–Born rule. The constitutive model for a two-dimensional continuum deforming in three dimensions (a surface) is written explicitly in terms of the underlying atomistic model. The resulting hyper-elastic potential depends on the stretch and the curvature of the surface, as well as on internal elastic variables describing the rearrangements of the crystal within the unit cell. Coarse grained calculations of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are performed by discretizing this continuum mechanics theory by finite elements. A smooth discrete representation of the surface is required, and subdivision finite elements, proposed for thin-shell analysis, are used. A detailed set of numerical experiments, in which the continuum/finite element solutions are compared to the corresponding full atomistic calculations of CNTs, involving very large deformations and geometric instabilities, demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed approach. Simulations for large multi-million systems illustrate the computational savings which can be achieved. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

Achieving this goal requires a breakthrough in our understanding of the unique crystallization kinetics of amorphous phase change materials as a fragile glass, described as the non-Arrhenius behavior of atomic mobility. It is a highly rewarding task to unravel the unconventional crystallization kinetics and related properties, because these properties can be utilized to predict the device characteristics. This manuscript utilizes the thin-film mechanics to investigate the crystallization kinetics of amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 phase-change materials doped with Al, Bi, C and N, which is an effective method to analyze the structural changes in amorphous materials. Crystallization temperature, super-cooled liquid region, glass transition temperature and fragility are measured to describe the crystallization kinetics tuned by doping; characteristic fragile-to-strong transition is observed for C and N dopings due to their structural feature as an interstitial dopant. Consequently, doping effects on the phase stability and atomic mobility manifested by the crystallization temperature and the super-cooled liquid region (or 1/fragility) successfully correspond with PcRAM characteristics, i.e., reliability and switching speed, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The Computer Aided Parallelisation Tools (CAPTools) [Ierotheou, C, Johnson SP, Cross M, Leggett PF, Computer aided parallelisation tools (CAPTools)—conceptual overview and performance on the parallelisation of structured mesh codes, Parallel Computing, 1996;22:163–195] is a set of interactive tools aimed to provide automatic parallelisation of serial FORTRAN Computational Mechanics (CM) programs. CAPTools analyses the user&#039;s serial code and then through stages of array partitioning, mask and communication calculation, generates parallel SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) messages passing FORTRAN.  The parallel code generated by CAPTools contains calls to a collection of routines that form the CAPTools communications Library (CAPLib). The library provides a portable layer and user friendly abstraction over the underlying parallel environment. CAPLib contains optimised message passing routines for data exchange between parallel processes and other utility routines for parallel execution control, initialisation and debugging. By compiling and linking with different implementations of the library, the user is able to run on many different parallel environments.  Even with today&#039;s parallel systems the concept of a single version of a parallel application code is more of an aspiration than a reality. However for CM codes the data partitioning SPMD paradigm requires a relatively small set of message-passing communication calls. This set can be implemented as an intermediate ‘thin layer’ library of message-passing calls that enables the parallel code (especially that generated automatically by a parallelisation tool such as CAPTools) to be as generic as possible.  CAPLib is just such a ‘thin layer’ message passing library that supports parallel CM codes, by mapping generic calls onto machine specific libraries (such as CRAY SHMEM) and portable general purpose libraries (such as PVM an MPI). This paper describe CAPLib together with its three perceived advantages over other routes:• as a high level abstraction, it is both easy to understand (especially when generated automatically by tools) and to implement by hand, for the CM community (who are not generally parallel computing specialists); • the one parallel version of the application code is truly generic and portable; • the parallel application can readily utilise whatever message passing libraries on a given machine yield optimum performance.",

It is found that for the values of ??, where the stress in the off-axis plies normal to the fibers is tensile, ply cracks lying along fibers initiate and increase in number, while for other ?? values the plies do not undergo this damage, as expected. However, the overall laminate elastic moduli are also found to change for the ?? values where no ply cracks exist. It is postulated that a shear-induced degradation of the off-axis plies is responsible for the observed laminate moduli changes. The prediction of changes in these moduli by using the ply shear modulus measured on [????4](s) appears to support this postulate. For the case of moduli changes caused by ply cracks the recently proposed synergistic damage-mechanics approach [1] is applied. The implications of the findings of this work on a class of continuum damage-mechanics formulations proposed in the literature are discussed.",

It is shown that it is possible to do so with a single element across the thickness of the ply, provided that the interface stiffness is properly selected. The optimal value for this interface stiffness is derived with an analytical shear lag model. It is also shown that, when the appropriate statistical variation of properties has been applied, models with a single element through the thickness of a ply can predict the density of transverse matrix cracks.",

            "abstract": "A critically tapered fold-and-thrust belt or submarine accretionary wedge is one that is on the verge of Coulomb failure everywhere, including its base where frictional sliding along a decollement is assumed to be occurring. Cohesion within a wedge can add significantly to the overall strength near the toe; the effect of this is to decrease the near-toe taper, leading to a critical topographic profile that is concave upward if the decollement is planar. We obtain an approximate self-consistent solution for the state of stress within a thin-skinned cohesive critical Coulomb wedge, and determine the relationship between the wedge taper and its strength and basal friction. The theory is then applied to the presently deforming fold-and-thrust belt of western Taiwan. Fitting of theoretical critical wedge shapes to topographic pro- files and measurements of the step-up angles of thrust faults from the basal decollement are used to constrain the Taiwan wedge strength parameters. An attractive assertion fully consistent with all the observations is that the mechanics of fold-and-thrust belts and accretionary wedges is governed by normal frictional and fracture strengths of rocks measured in the laboratory. In particular, if Byerlee&#039;s law/•b = 0.85 is adopted as the coefficient of sliding friction on the base, we find a coefficient of internal friction/• - 0.9-1.0 in the wedge and a wedge cohesion S O - 5-20 MPa. Other solutions having strengths and ambient stresses up to 4 times lower than this can also, however, satisfy the data. INTRODUCTION",

The well-established Johnson–Kendal–Roberts (JKR) theory is applied to extract the surface energy of the contacting solids. For this thin-layer system, the JKR theory should be an error as it is based on the indentation of an elastic half-space with an elastic sphere. A continuum mechanics approach coupled with non-dimensional analysis and finite elements simulation is presented to explain the indentation process of multi-layer elastic systems under the presence of adhesion. The emphasis is on spherical and flat punch probes. Computations of contact size and contact stiffness as a function of load are presented for a range of values of adhesion energies.",

We show that the direction of the flaking force is determined mainly by the stiffness of the flake, the actual angle of the blow or impulse having relatively little effect. Long thin flakes can be easily produced because this direction of the flaking force is very close to that necessary to produce local symmetry at the tip of the crack propagating parallel to the surface of the stone.",

Several aspects of the problem are considered, including conditions for the onset of matrix cracking, the evolution of crack spacing, the compliance of the cracked laminate, and the overall strain contributed by residual stress when matrix cracking occurs. The heart of the analysis is the plane strain problem for a doubly periodic array of cracks in the 90° layers. A fairly complete solution to this problem is presented based on finite element calculations. In addition, a useful, accurate closed form representation is also included. This solution permits the estimation of compliance change and strain due to release of residual stress. It can also be used to predict the energy release rate of cracks tunneling through the matrix. In turn, this energy release rate can be used to predict both the onset of matrix cracking and the evolution of crack spacing in the 90° layers as a function of applied stress. All these results are used to construct overall stress-strain behavior of a laminate undergoing matrix cracking in the presence of initial residual stress.",

Disclinations are defined as linear defects in solids, which manifest themselves as the sources of characteristic singularities in the fields of displacement and rotation. Necessary terminilogy and designations: Volterra dislocations, Frank (rotation) vector of a disclination, wedge and twist disclinations, are provided and discussed. The properties of screened disclination configurations (loops, dipoles, defects in small particles, etc.) with relatively small energies are considered. The methods and results of calculation of elastic energies for screened disclinations (for example, near a free surface) are presented. On the basis of properties of screened disclinations a series of models for the processes in the structure of plastically deformed materials is developed. The bands with misorientated crystal lattice in metals and other materials are described as a result of partial wedge disclination dipole motion. Disclination models are applied to the analysis of workhardening at large strains and to the theory of grain boundaries and their junctions in polycrystals. Disclination models for the structure and properties of nanostructured materials and nanoparticles are also delivered. Finally, the role of disclinations in relaxation of elastic stresses in epitaxial thin films is highlighted.",

The high stiffness-to-weight ratio of this material makes it ideal for primary structures on airplanes, satellites, and spacecrafts. Nevertheless, the manufacturing of such composites remains very costly since it requires equipment investment such as an autoclave or an automated fibre placement machine, and very qualified workers. Out- of-autoclave manufacturing technology is very promising since it only requires a traditional oven, while still aiming at similar part quality. However, the absence of positive pressure compared with an autoclave makes it more difficult to achieve low porosity parts. This article investigates the manufacturing of complex features with out-of-autoclave prepreg technology. The features investigated are tight-radius corners with a curvature change, and ply terminations. Ply drop tests were conducted to identify if porosity is higher at ply terminations. The bagging arrangement was modified to achieve the most uniform thickness in areas of curvature change, even with small radii. The conclusions from these studies provide us with guidelines to manufacture a larger part, which includes these features.",

Negative-depth needle punching and thermal bonding were applied to strengthen the structure with two compound cover plies and a fluffy cushioning center ply. The effects of center ply areal density, needle punching depth, and fiber blending ratio on the static and dynamic impact resistance behaviors of the composites were investigated. The results indicated that areal density significantly influenced the static and dynamic impact behaviors, which were both enhanced by the promotion of thermal-bonding points. As the needle punching deepened, the static and dynamic puncture resistances represented opposite tendencies because of different failure mecha- nisms. Static friction was the dominant factor for static puncture resistance, whereas kinetic friction was the dominant factor for dynamic puncture resistance. A similar phenomenon was observed when fiber blending ratio was varied. In terms of the non-penetrating dynamic cushioning test, areal density was the most distinct influence factor on cushioning behavior and the hybrid composites sample with an areal density of 700 g/m2 could eliminate up to 66.5% of the incident force. Therefore, the inter/ intra-ply hybrid composites showed high impact resistance and excellent dynamic cushioning property.",

The model calibration by means of the provided material data is described and the limits of applicability of the proposed constitutive model are discussed.

The test cases consider unidirectional and multidirectional laminates under biaxial loads, laminates under various loading conditions (uniaxial, bending, thermal, loading and unloading) and laminates with open hole under tension or compression.

A new test method was designed to characterize the inter-ply shear property. The samples after interlaminar shear tests were also investigated through the yarn pulling-out and meso-structure to discover their deformation and failure mechanism. The results have shown that the fabric density has significant influence on the in-plane shear and inter-ply shear properties of 3D angle interlock preforms and the shear performance decreases with the increasing of the fabric density. The lower fabric density, the better deformability. The inter-ply shear damage mode is the binder yarn pulling out from the fabric.

When plain PZT particles were distributed in the ply interfaces, the loss factor increased but suddenly dropped with increased particle loading, producing a threshold effect. As the loss factor represents the joule heat of electric current between PZT particles and carbon fibers, the sudden drop implies that there exists incomplete connectivity. To demonstrate the effect of incomplete connectivity, plain PZT particles were coated with carbon black of various weight fraction and the experiments were repeated. The results show there exists an optimal coating ratio of carbon black where the loss factor reaches its maximum value.

In the present paper, we present a generalized analytical study of the self-folding of thin plates into deterministic 3D shapes through fluid-solid interactions. Based on the beam theory, a mechanics model is developed, incorporating the two competing components-a capillary force promoting folding and the beinding rigidity of the foil that resists folding into a 3D structure. Through an equivalence argument of thin foils of different geometry, an effective folding parameter, which uniquely characterizes the driving force for folding, has been identified. A criterion for spontaneous folding of any shaped 2D patterned foil based on the effective folding parameter is thus established. The model predictions show excellent agreement with experimental measurements made on a variety of materials, indicating that the assumptions used in the analysis are valid. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To elucidate the effect of dynamic impact on the strain rate, the Cowper-Symonds equation is applied to analyze the plastic state of stress and the onset of dynamic yielding under different strain rates, such that the modeled deformation behavior of the member is consistent with the actual situation. Results for the thin-walled members made of mild steel and dual phase steel are compared. Assuming two different materials with equal sectional areas, an analysis confirms that the energy absorption of high-strength steel thin-walled component is better than the mild steel thin-walled component. Hence, thin-walled tubes made of high-strength steel are investigated using a series of analysis. The relationships between displacement and load, average load and energy absorption properties are obtained. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "An improved numerical method to evaluate exactly the element stiffness matrix is proposed for the lateral buckling analysis of thin-walled composite I- and channel-section beams with symmetric and arbitrary laminations subjected to end moments. For this, the bifurcation type buckling theory of thin-walled composite beams subjected to pure bending is developed based on the energy functional. Stability equations and force–deformation relationships are derived from the energy principle and explicit expressions for displacement parameters are derived based on power series expansions of displacement components. Then the exact element stiffness matrix is determined using force–deformation relationships. In addition, analytical solutions for lateral buckling moments of unidirectional and cross-ply laminated composite beams with various boundary conditions are derived, as a special case. Finally, the finite element procedure based on Hermitian interpolation polynomials is developed. In order to verify the accuracy of this study, numerical solutions are presented and compared with the analytical solutions and the finite element solutions using the Hermitian beam elements, ABAQUS’s shell elements and the results by other researchers. Also, the effects of fiber orientation and the Wagner effect on the lateral buckling moments are studied.",

In the experiments, the stress-strain response of two sets of Cu films is determined in the plane-strain bulge test. One set of samples consists of electroplated Cu films, while the other set is sputter-deposited. Unpassivated films, films passivated on one side and films passivated on both sides are considered. The calculations are carried out within a two-dimensional plane strain framework with the dislocations modeled as line singularities in an isotropic elastic solid. The film is modeled by a unit cell consisting of eight grains, each of which has three slip systems. The film is initially free of dislocations which then nucleate from a specified distribution of Frank-Read sources. The grain boundaries and any film-passivation layer interfaces are taken to be impenetrable to dislocations. Both the experiments and the computations show: (i) a flow strength for the passivated films that is greater than for the unpassivated films and (ii) hysteresis and a Bauschinger effect that increases with increasing pre-strain for passivated films, while for unpassivated films hysteresis and a Bauschinger effect are small or absent. Furthermore, the experimental measurements and computational results for the 0.2% offset yield strength stress, and the evolution of hysteresis and of the Bauschinger effect are in good quantitative agreement. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We introduce a new motion planner to maneuver these devices to clinical targets while minimizing the probability of colliding with anatomical obstacles. Unlike prior planners for these devices, we more accurately model device shape using mechanics-based models that consider torsional interaction between the tubes. We also account for the effects of uncertainty in actuation and predicted device shape. We integrate these models with a sampling-based approach based on the Rapidly-Exploring Roadmap to guarantee finding optimal plans as computation time is allowed to increase.

However, false-positive results with conventional ply-based PCR have been reported. The aim here was to study the performance of a quantitative ply-based PCR for the identification of pneumococcal lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). In a prospective study, fibreoptic bronchoscopy was performed in 156 hospitalized adult patients with LRTI and 31 controls who underwent bronchoscopy because of suspicion of malignancy. Among the LRTI patients and controls, the quantitative ply-based PCR applied to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was positive at &gt;or=10(3) genome copies/mL in 61% and 71% of the subjects, at &gt;or=10(5) genome copies/mL in 40% and 58% of the subjects, and at &gt;or=10(7) genome copies/mL in 15% and 3.2% of the subjects, respectively. Using BAL fluid culture, blood culture, and/or a urinary antigen test, S. pneumoniae was identified in 19 LRTI patients. As compared with these diagnostic methods used in combination, quantitative ply-based PCR showed sensitivities and specificities of 89% and 43% at a cut-off of 10(3) genome copies/mL, of 84% and 66% at a cut-off of 10(5) genome copies/mL, and of 53% and 90% at a cut-off of 10(7) genome copies/mL, respectively. In conclusion, a high cut-off with the quantitative ply-based PCR was required to reach acceptable specificity. However, as a high cut-off resulted in low sensitivity, quantitative ply-based PCR does not appear to be clinically useful. Quantitative PCR methods for S. pneumoniae using alternative gene targets should be evaluated.",

            "abstract": "The past 15 years have seen a revolution in fault mechanics. Before the 1990s, the field was limited to the Andersonian fault mechanics, which offered no mechanism for fault propagation and grown. Linear elastic fracture mechanics, which had been applied to calculating the stress fields around faults, also did not offer a mechanism for fault growth. The CTOA model, an elastic-plastic numerical model that allows for inelastic yielding in a volume surrounding the crack tip, is consistent with all observations concerning fault growth. It predicts the linear scaling between fault displacement and length, and the observation that faults propagate by the breakdown of a brittle process zone that widens with fault length. The process zone consists primarily of intergranular dilatant microcracks that are oriented parallel to the maximum principal stress of the fault tip stress field and whose density increases exponentially as the fault is approached. These properties are consistent with theory and laboratory experiments. The theory is also consistent with the observation that fault tip displacement tapers are linear, scale independent, and increase with rock strength. Fault interactions through their stress fields are not understood except for the simple case of subparallel faults. These interactions result in the development of fault populations with well-defined statistical properties. These populations evolve with increasing brittle strain from power law to exponential size distributions and finally to evenly spaced system size faults. Fault rocks and structures are described as a function of depth, from the upper schizosphere through the plastosphere. The strength of faults is shown to be consistent with Byerlee friction, and the weak San Andreas Fault hypothesis is critiqued. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

It draws on the decades of teaching and research experience of the author and the course material of the senior undergraduate and graduate level classes he has taught.New and up-to-date information throughout the text brings modern engineering students everything they need to advance their knowledge of the evermore common composite materials. The introduction strengthens the book&#039;s emphasis on basic principles of mechanics by adding a review of the basic mechanics of materials equations. New appendices cover the derivations of stress equilibrium equations and the strain-displacement relations from elasticity theory. Additional sections address recent applications of composite mechanics to nanocomposites, composite grid structures, and composite sandwich structures. More detailed discussion of elasticity and finite element models have been included along with results from the recent World Wide Failure Exercise. The author takes a phenomenological approach to illustrate linear viscoelastic behavior of composites. Updated information on the nature of fracture and composite testing includes coverage of the finite element implementation of the Virtual Crack Closure techniqueand new and revised ASTM standard test methods. The author includes updated and expanded material property tables, many more example problems and homework exercises, as well as new reference citings throughout the text.Requiring a solid foundation in materials mechanics, engineering, linear algebra, and differential equations, Principles of Composite Materials Mechanics, Second Edition provides the advanced knowledge in composite materials needed by today&#039;s materials scientists and engineers.",

This paper discusses new areas where contact mechanics could contribute extensively if a certain number of questions were answered. Some domains just lack data to include in existing models; for instance information on the thermo-mechanical properties of thin coatings is lacking, and an effort in that direction would open up the design of coated machine elements to contact mechanics. Similar deficiencies are noted in fracture mechanics. In other areas, transfer of contact mechanics methods to industrial problems is hindered by changes in material properties under working conditions. Flow stress, toughness, etc vary during most sliding or rolling operations, and contact analyses should include these variations. A strong cooperation between mathematicians, mechanical engineers and material scientists can extend the field of application of contact mechanics in the design of machine elements.",

Tissues transmit mechanical loads just like bridges and building structures. Not only do they transmit loads, but also they adapt their own structures so that the structures will transmit the mechanical loads more effectively, unlike bridges and building structures. The structures of living tissues are continually changing due to growth and response to the tissue environment, including the mechanical environment. The objective of this text is to describe the nature of the composite components of a tissue, the cellular processes that produce these constituents, the assembly of the constituents into a hierarchical structure, and the behavior of the tissues composite structure in the adaptation to its mechanical environment. A tissues mechanical environment is the history of mechanical loading experienced by the tissue in some reference time period, like a day. The most important features of the textbook are its middle level, neither too advanced nor too elementary, its fresh perspective on older material issues, and the inclusion of new research results carefully crafted onto this intermediate base of mechanics. Key Features: An introductory chapter on the structure of tissues and the fascinating unresolved problems concerning how biological tissues are formed and constructed.

First, a delayed-fracture model for a crack in a brittle material was established on the basis of the slow crack growth (SCG) concept in conjunction with a probabilistic fracture model using the three-parameter Weibull distribution. Second, the above probabilistic SCG model was applied to transverse cracking in cross-ply laminates under static fatigue loading. The stress and the length of the unit element in the transverse layers were calculated with the aid of a shear-lag analysis, taking the residual stress into account. The transverse crack density was expressed as a function of applied stress and time with the parameters in the Paris law and the Weibull distribution function specified, in addition to the mechanical and geometrical properties. Unknown parameters were determined from experiment data gathered in static tensile and static fatigue tests. The reproduced transverse crack density at various applied loads agreed well with the experiment results. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The experiment was conducted in the east of the Rolling Pampa region, Buenos Aires State, Argentina at 34°25′S, 59°15′W; altitude 22m above sea level. Rut depth after traffic and soil bulk density and cone index in a 0–450-mm profile were measured before and after traffic. Considering topsoil level, in two tillage regimes, all treatments induced significant values of soil compaction as compared to the control plot without traffic.

            "abstract": "Transverse and shear damage in the polymer matrix of fiber reinforced composites are often treated independently, while the associated cracks are similar in appearance and effect. Matrix damage is often quantified by its crack density. However, damage also can be presented as a state variable. The definition of damage state variables and their evolution laws are the foundation of continuum damage mechanics, yet experimental data for shear damage evolution is limited. The effect of crack closure on the transverse stiffness of laminates was already incorporated in the damage models. However, the shear modulus sensitivity to crack closure has received little attention due to the complicated constitutive equations. This paper focused on the in-plane shear modulus reduction due to matrix transverse cracks and the evolution of transverse and shear damage. The comparison of existing models with experimental data showed that shear damage is currently not suitably described. Accordingly, a shear damage evolution model was proposed that included the effect of internal traction and crack closure on the in-plane shear modulus. The numerical predictions of the modified shear model resulted in good agreement with experimental data by predicting the same saturation crack density, axial and shear responses.",

            "abstract": "This is the second edition of the valuable reference source for numerical simulations of contact mechanics suitable for many fields like civil engineering, car design, aeronautics, metal forming, or biomechanics. Boundary value problems involving contact are of great importance in industrial applications in engineering such as bearings, metal forming processes, rubber seals, drilling problems, crash analysis of cars, rolling contact between car tires and the road, cooling of electronic devices... Other applications are related to biomechanical engineering design where human joints, implants or teeth are of consideration. Due to this variety, contact problems are today combined either with large elastic or inelastic deformations including time dependent responses. Thermal coupling also might have to be considered. Even stability behaviour has to be linked to contact. The topic of computational contact is described in depth providing an up-to-date treatment of different formulations, algorithms and discretisation techniques for contact problems which are established in the geometrically linear and nonlinear range. This book provides the necessary continuum mechanics background which includes the derivation of the contact constraints. Constitutive equations stemming from tribology which are valid at the contact interface are discussed in detail. Discretization schemes for small and finite deformations are discussed in depth. Solid and beam contact is considered as well as contact of unstable systems and thermomechanical contact. The algorithmic side covers a broad range of solution methods. Additionally adaptive discretisation techniques for contact analysis are presented as a modern tool for engineering design simulations. The present text book is written for graduate, Masters and PhD students, but also for engineers in industry, who have to simulate contact problems in practical application and wish to understand the theoretical and algorithmic background of contact treatment in modern finite element systems. For this second edition, illustrative simplified examples and new discretisation schemes as well as adaptive procedures for coupled problems are added. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

These measurements were normalized to values of segment stress and strain. Under passive conditions stress-strain relations for the rings appeared to be stiffer than those obtained using cylindrical segments. Pressure-diameter curves computed using force-length data from the rings were shifted to higher values of diameter compared with values from the intact segments at all pressure levels. Passive mechanics derived from measurements on ring segments yielded poor estimates of mechanics derived from intact segments. Despite this finding, values of active force development from the two sample geometries were similar. No statistically significant differences were found in values of maximum force development expressed in terms of sample cross-sectional area. Some differences in values of active force development at low values of muscle length were found. The latter were probably related to the differences in passive mechanics and the procedure used to normalize muscle length. Reasonable values of active force development can be obtained from ring segments.",

Thus, there are no solutions available for the buckling of coupled laminates subjected to shear loading.This paper is concerned with the stability of unsymmetric cross-ply rectangular plates under uniform shear. These composites consist of an even number of layers all of the same thickness and elastic properties with the orthotropic axes of symmetry in each ply alternately oriented at 0° and 90° to the plate axes. Hinge- support boundary conditions are considered. The effect of coupling is ascertained by comparing coupled solutions to those obtained by neglecting the coupling coefficients in the governing equations.

            "abstract": "Polymers confined to small dimensions and that undergo high strains can show remarkable nonlinear mechanics, which must be understood to accurately predict the functioning of nanoscale polymer devices. In this paper we describe the determination of the mechanical properties of ultrathin polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films undergoing large strains, using atomic force microscope (AFM) indentation with a spherical tip. The PDMS was molded into extremely thin films of variable thickness and adhered to a hard substrate. We found that for films below 1 μm in thickness the Young&#039;s modulus increased with decreasing sample thickness with a power law exponent of 1.35. Furthermore, as the soft PDMS film was indented, significant strain hardening was observed as the indentation depth approached 45% of the sample thickness. To properly quantify the nonlinear mechanical measurements, we utilized a pointwise Hertzian model which assumes only piecewise linearity on the part of the probed material. This analysis revealed three regions within the material. A linear region with a constant Young&#039;s modulus was seen for compression up to 45% strain. At strains higher than 45%, a marked increase in Young&#039;s modulus was measured. The onset of strain induced stiffening is well modeled by finite element modeling and occurs as stress contours expanding from the probe and the substrate overlap. A third region of mechanical variation occurred at small indentations of less than 10 nm. The pointwise Young&#039;s modulus at small indentations was several orders of magnitude higher than that in the linear elasticity region; we studied and ruled out causes responsible for this phenomenon. In total, these effects can cause thin elastomer films to become extremely stiff such that the measured Young&#039;s modulus is over a 100-fold higher than the bulk PDMS. Therefore, the mechanics of a polymer can be changed by adjusting the geometry of a material, in addition to changing the material itself. In addition to understanding the mechanics of thin polymer films, this work provides an excellent test of experimental techniques to measure the mechanics of other nonlinear and heterogeneous materials such as biological cells.",

The tensile strain required to initiate transverse cracking in the 90-deg ply was found to depend on the thickness of the 90-deg layer. For n ≤ 3 delamination was initiated at the edge of the coupon. The onset of delamination occurred before or after transverse cracking, depending on the laminate construction. For n ≥ 4 delamination at the 25/90 interface was initiated across the entire width of the coupon by the formation of a transverse crack in the 90-deg ply. In some laminate constructions the location of specimen separation during final fracture was associated with the growth and coalescence of edge delaminations under either incrementally increasing or constant strain cyclic loading.

            "abstract": "Based on recent in situ measurements, Chason et al. (2002) proposed that the evolution of compressive stress during thin film growth by vapor deposition is due to an increase in surface chemical potential in the presence of growth flux and the consequent exchange of adatoms between the free surface and the grain boundaries. Based on this hypothesis, we present a model for grain boundary stress evolution during thin film growth. To illustrate the mechanics of the problem, first it is assumed that the local normal stress on the grain boundary is proportional to the local grain boundary opening only. The resulting &quot;linear spring&quot; model captures all essential features of the experimental observations. A more accurate description of the grain boundary stress evolution is presented by modeling the stress field due to the material inserted into the grain boundary as that resulting from a continuous distribution of dislocations along the grain boundary. The adatom flux between the grain boundary and the free surface is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potential between the two. This model successfully explains a wide range of experimental observations, including the development of compressive stress during room temperature growth, effect of growth rate on the kinetics of compressive stress evolution and the continued tensile stress generation during low-temperature growth.

This putative relationship between anatomy, behavior, and ecology is tested here by examining gait mechanics in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a primate that has sharp claws and reduced pedal grasping, and that spends much of its time clinging on large trunks. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected on three male Callithrix jacchus as they walked across a force platform attached to the ground or to raised horizontal poles. The vast majority of all walking gaits were lateral-sequence. For all steps, the humerus was retracted (&lt;90 degrees relative to a horizontal axis) or held in a neutral (90 degrees ) position at forelimb touchdown. Peak vertical forces on the forelimb were always higher than those on the hindlimb. These three features of the walking gaits of C. jacchus separate it from any other primate studied (including other callitrichids). The walking gaits of C. jacchus are mechanically more similar to those of small, nonprimate mammals. The results of this study support previous models that suggest that the unusual suite of features that typify the walking gaits of most primates are adaptations to the requirements of locomotion on thin arboreal supports. These data, along with data from other primates and marsupials, suggest that primate postcranial and locomotor characteristics are part of a basal adaptation for walking on thin branches.",

Several sets of truncated approximate theories are applied to solve the eigenvalue problems of a simply supported thick laminated plate. In order to assure the accuracy of the present theory, convergence properties of the fundamental natural frequency are examined in detail. Numerical results are compared with those of the published existing theories. The modal displacement and stress distributions in the thickness direction are obtained and plotted in figures.

If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting &quot;subjective statistical mechanics&quot;, the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that cound have been made on the basis of the information available. It is concluded that statistical mechancis need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.",

In the first group, the top surface has an imposed stress, while in the other, an imposed velocity.

The order of error to approximate SWCNTs as thin shells is studied in this paper via an atomistic-based finite-deformation shell theory, which avoids the shell thickness and Young&#039;s modulus, but links the tension and bending rigidities directly to the interatomic potential. The ratio of atomic spacing (Δ≈0.14 nm) to the radius of SWCNT, Δ/R, which ranges from zero (for graphene) to 40% [for a small (5,5) armchair SWCNT (R=0.35 nm)], is used to estimate the order of error. For the order of error O[(Δ/R)3], SWCNTs cannot be represented by a conventional thin shell because their constitutive relation involves the coupling between tension and curvature and between bending and strain. For the order of error O[(Δ/R)2], the tension and bending (shear and torsion) rigidities of SWCNTs can be represented by an elastic orthotropic thin shell, but the thickness and elastic modulus cannot. Only for the order of error O(Δ/R), a universal constant shell thickness can be defined and SWCNTs can be modeled as an elastic isotropic thin shell. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

These distributions are based on our observations of the fibrous- sheet laminar architecture of myocardial tissue.

Pressure–volume relations and 3D principal strains predicted by the model are compared with experimental observations. A model of active tissue properties, based on isolated muscle experiments, is also introduced in order to predict transmural distributions of 3D principal strains at the end of the contraction phase of the cardiac cycle.

The ability to measure crack propagation at large values of the energy release rate was limited by rupture of the silicone elastomer that was used to provide a sufficiently compliant matrix for the adhesion expt.

Compliance measurements were used to determine flexural rigidity (assuming a fixed-edge circular plate approximation) and composite modulus of the base plates.

Barnacles that were &#039;hard&#039; (&gt; or =70% of the base plate thin, rigid cement) and &#039;gummy&#039; (&gt;30% of the base plate covered in compliant, tacky cement) showed statistically different composite moduli but did not show a difference in base plate flexural rigidity.

Lens membranes mainly comprise two proteins; aquaporin 0 and connexin, forming respectively thin and gap intercellular junctions that sustain mechanical stress during accommodation. Our results reveal the mechanical heterogeneity of the plasma membrane, allowing examination of the mechanical nanoenvironment of individual proteins and the flexibility of supramolecular assemblies. The remarkable rigidity of gap junctions suggests their role as stable intercellular adhesion complexes ensuring maintenance of thin junctions, which form more flexible supramolecular complexes capable of sustaining pressure differences between cells. Our work proposes the mechanical properties of individual proteins and protein domains directly related to biological function as a novel molecular signature.",

            "abstract": "Molecular mechanics (MM) methods are computationally affordable tools for screening chemical libraries of novel compounds for sites of P450 metabolism. One challenge for MM methods has been the absence of a consistent and transferable set of parameters for the heme within the P450 active site. Experimental data indicate that mammalian P450 enzymes vary greatly in the size, architecture, and plasticity of their active sites. Thus, obtaining X-ray-based geometries for the development of accurate MM parameters for the major classes of hepatic P450 remains a daunting task. Our previous work with preliminary gas-phase quantum mechanics (QM)-derived atomic partial charges greatly improved the accuracy of docking studies of raloxifene to CYP3A4. We have therefore developed and tested a consistent set of transferable MM parameters based on gas-phase QM calculations of two model systems of the heme-a truncated (T-HM) and a full (F-HM) for four states of the P450 catalytic cycle. Our results indicate that the use of the atomic partial charges from the F-HM further improves the accuracy of docked predictions for raloxifene to CYP3A4. Different patterns for substrate docking are also observed depending on the choice of heme model and state. Newly parameterized heme models are tested in implicit and explicitly solvated MD simulations in the absence and presence of enzyme structures, for CYP3A4, and appear to be stable on the nanosecond simulation timescale. The new force field for the various heme states may aid the community for simulations of P450 enzymes and other heme-containing enzymes. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2011.",

The main structure to be analyzed is built of multi-angle fibrous laminated lay-ups having different volume fractions of the constituent materials within the individual plies. This leads to a piecewise grading of the material in the radial direction. The objective is to maximize the critical buckling pressure while preserving the total structural mass at a constant value equal to that of a baseline design. The fiber volume fractions are included among the standard design variables such as fiber orientation angles and ply thicknesses, which are used by many investigators in the field. The model employs the classical lamination theory, where an analytical solution that accounts for the effective axial and flexural stiffness separately is given. The critical buckling pressure contours subject to the mass equality constraint are given for several types of anisotropic rings/long cylinders showing the functional dependence of the constrained objective function on the selected design variables. It is shown that material grading can have significant contribution to the whole optimization process in achieving the required structural designs with enhanced stability limits. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

The notch tip damage zone grows stably under tensile cyclic loading in a self-similar manner and the size and shape of this damage zone is dependent on laminate geometry and constituent properties of the fibre, matrix and interface. The post-fatigue strength and stiffness of the laminate can be related uniquely to the split length, which defines the extent of damage growth. In this first paper in a series of four, observation is made and measurements taken of the damage growth mechanisms that make up the damage zone in carbon fibre/epoxy laminates. Radiographs are used to characterise the notch tip damage zone and to establish a qualitative relationship between post-fatigue strength (or stiffness), cyclic stress, damage size and numbers of cycles.",

Two layer laminates were fabricated with various nano Au film on micron scale PDMS substrate and tested using a micro-tensile tester. Also, in-situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests captured the digital images of Au film under static load to explain the changes in grain structure of the gold film. Stress-strain data for the gold film under large deformation was extracted using a mechanics of material based model, and changes in stiffness values of the Au film were determined. The experimental results validated the Hall-Petch law indicating that the material strength properties have inverse relationship with grain size. Results indicated that the metallic Au films sustained large deformation without rupture and SEM studies indicated that at higher strain levels, grains in the Au film experienced intra- granular fractures.",

In this paper we analyze a channel crack advancing in an elastic film, while an underlayer creeps. The film is subject to a tensile stress. As the underlayer creeps, the stress field in the film relaxes in the crack wake, and intensifies around the crack tip. In a blanket film, the crack can attain a steady velocity, set by two rate processes: subcritical decohesion at the crack tip, and creep in the underlayer. In a thin-film microbridge over a viscous stripe, the crack cannot grow when the bridge is short, and can grow at a steady velocity when the bridge is long. We use a two-dimensional shear lag model to approximate the three-dimensional fracture process, and an extended finite element method to simulate the moving crack with an invariant, relatively coarse mesh. On the basis of the theoretical findings, we propose new experiments to measure fracture toughness and creep laws in small structures. As a byproduct, an analytical formula is found for the growth rate per temperature cycle of a channel crack in a brittle film, induced by ratcheting plastic deformation in a metal underlayer.",

            "abstract": "An active diapir forcefully intrudes its overburden, driven by diapir pressure that overcomes the resistance of the overburden strength. Possible causes for the driving pressure are differential loading of the source layer and a density contrast with the overburden. Possible resisting forces derive from the mass of the roof block and resistance to the faulting and folding that accommodate the intrusion. For a typical density contrast between salt and a sedimentary overburden, a simple force balance demonstrates that the diapir height must be more than two-thirds to three-quarters the thickness of the surrounding overburden to initiate substantial active diapirism. Narrow diapirs must be even taller. Physical and numerical modeling show that typical structures of active diapirism are a central crestal graben flanked by relatively unstrained flaps that rotate upward and outward. Curved reverse faults can separate the flaps from the regional overburden. Normal faults in the crestal graben propagate downward, with new faults created farther outward as the roof arches over the rising diapir. Thin, wide roofs develop multiple grabens separating a relatively flat roof from the rotating flaps. In cases leading to emergence, the piercing diapir evolves from a pointed crest to a progressively rounded and widening crest as the flaps rotate outward. The numerical models show that overburden flexure contributes to early formation of active diapir structures, but piercement does not continue to emergence unless the diapir is very wide or tall relative to the overburden thickness. Active diapirism becomes progressively more difficult for diapir crests ranging from a rectangle, a round-cornered rectangle, a semicircle, to a triangle with a pointed crest.",

A rigid sphere is coated with a wetting liquid, and then wrapped by a thin film having an approximately cylindrical shape. The equilibrium of the film is governed by the competing effects of elasticity and capillarity: elasticity tends to keep the film developable while capillarity tends to curve it in both directions so as to maximize the area of contact with the sphere. In the experiments, the region of contact between the film and the sphere has cylindrical symmetry when the sphere radius is small, but destabilizes to a non-symmetric, wrinkled configuration when the radius is larger than a critical value. We combine the Donnell equations for near-cylindrical shells to include a unilateral constraint with the impenetrable sphere, and the capillary forces acting along a moving edge. A non-linear solution describing the axisymmetric configuration of the film is derived. A linear stability analysis is then presented, which successfully captures the wrinkling instability, the symmetry of the unstable mode, the instability threshold and the critical wavelength. The motion of the free boundary at the edge of the region of contact, which has an effect on the instability, is treated without any approximation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstract": "Soon after the discovery of carbon nanotubes, it was realized that the theoretically predicted mechanical properties of these interesting structures–including high strength, high stiffness, low density and structural perfection–could make them ideal for a wealth of technological applications. The experimental verification, and in some cases refutation, of these predictions, along with a number of computer simulation methods applied to their modeling, has led over the past decade to an improved but by no means complete understanding of the mechanics of carbon nanotubes. We review the theoretical predictions and discuss the experimental techniques that are most often used for the challenging tasks of visualizing and manipulating these tiny structures. We also outline the computational approaches that have been taken, including ab initio quantum mechanical simulations, classical molecular dynamics, and continuum models. The development of multiscale and multiphysics models and simulation tools naturally arises as a result of the link between basic scientific research and engineering application; while this issue is still under intensive study, we present here some of the approaches to this topic. Our concentration throughout is on the exploration of mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus, bending stiffness, buckling criteria, and tensile and compressive strengths. Finally, we discuss several examples of exciting applications that take advantage of these properties, including nanoropes, filled nanotubes, nanoelectromechanical systems, nanosensors, and nanotube-reinforced polymers.

In this work,   electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID) has been used to deposit carbon   films that are similar to those that have recently been used for   clamping nanostructures. The film deposition rate was accelerated by   placing a paraffin source of hydrocarbon near the area where the EBID   deposits were made. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy,   electron-energy-loss spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,   secondary-ion-mass spectrometry, and nanoindentation were used to   characterize the chemical composition and the mechanics of the   carbonaceous deposits. The typical EBID deposit was found to be   hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) having more sp(2)- than   sp(3)-bonded carbon. Nanoindentation tests revealed a hardness of   similar to 4 GPa and an elastic modulus of 30-60 GPa, depending on the   accelerating voltage. This reflects a relatively soft film, which is   built out of precursor molecular ions impacting the growing surface   layer with low energies.

With one exception (fracture of thin plates) this localized deformatiin and the ensuing separation is a result of the non-continuum character of solid matter. The solid should therefore be modelled as an aggregate of cells, each one containing one nucleus for the dominating microseparation mechanism, rather than as a continuum. By starting from a discussion of this approach and gradually introducing simplifications, approximations and restrictions of problem types, currently practiced methods in fracture mechanics are examined. The conclusion is that the foundations of these methods are very weak. Some suggestions are made about very simple engineering methods and about directions of future research work.",

            "abstract": "Deciphering the internal structure of large fault zones is fundamental if a proper understanding is to be gained of their mechanical, hydrological and seismological properties. To this end, new detailed mapping and microstructural observations of the excellently exposed Carboneras fault zone in southeastern Spain have been used to elucidate both the internal arrangement of fault products and their likely mechanical properties. The fault is a 40 km offset strike-slip fault, which constitutes part of the Africa-Iberia plate boundary. The zone of faulting is ∼ 1 km in width not including the associated damage zone surrounding the fault. It is composed of continuous strands of phyllosilicate-rich fault gouge that bound lenses of variably broken-up protolith. This arrangement provides a number of fluid flow and fluid sealing possibilities within the fault zone. The gouge strands exhibit distributed deformation and are inferred to have strain hardening and/or velocity hardening characteristics. Also included in the fault zone are blocks of dolomite that contain thin (&lt; 1 cm thick) fault planes inferred to have been produced by strain weakening/velocity weakening behaviour. These fault planes have a predominantly R1 Riedel shear orientation and are arranged in an en echelon pattern. A conceptual model of this type of wide fault zone is proposed which contrasts with previous narrow fault zone models. The observed structural and inferred mechanical characteristics of the Carboneras fault zone are compared to seismological observations of the San Andreas fault around Parkfield, CA. Similarities suggest that the Carboneras fault structure may be a useful analogue for this portion of the San Andreas fault at depth. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

Human anti-PhtD, -PcpA, and -Ply antibodies were purified and Fab fragments generated. Fabs were used to test inhibition of adherence of TIGR4 and nonencapsulated strain RX1 to A549 lung HECs. The roles of individual proteins in adherence were tested using isogenic mutants of strain TIGR4. Anti-PhtD, -PcpA, and -Ply human antibodies were assessed for their ability to inhibit NP colonization in vivo by passive transfer of human antibody in a murine model. Human antibodies generated against PhtD and PcpA caused a decrease in adherence to A549 cells (P &lt; 0.05). Anti-PhtD but not anti-PcpA antibodies showed a protective role against mouse NP colonization. To our surprise, anti-Ply antibodies also caused a significant (P &lt; 0.05) reduction in S. pneumoniae colonization.

Present work considers flat nose impact and contributions from through-thickness stresses and is mainly simulation based. A computational model was developed in ABAQUS™ software using adaptive meshing techniques. Simulation produced (2D model) stresses were numerically integrated using MATALB™ code to predict through-thickness (3D) stresses. Through-the-thickness stresses were then utilised in advanced failure criteria coded in MATLAB™ software to predict ply level failures. Simulation produced results demonstrate that the computational model can efficiently and effectively predict ply-by-ply failure status of relatively thick laminates. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

            "abstract": "The characterisation of the damage state of composite structures is often performed using the acoustic behaviour of the composite system. This behaviour is expected to change significantly as the damage is accumulating in the composite. It is indisputable that different damage mechanisms are activated within the composite laminate during loading scenario. These &quot;damage entities&quot; are acting in different space and time scales within the service life of the structure and may be interdependent. It has been argued that different damage mechanisms attribute distinct acoustic behaviour to the composite system. Loading of cross-ply laminates in particular leads to the accumulation of distinct damage mechanisms, such as matrix cracking, delamination between successive plies and fibre rupture at the final stage of loading. As highlighted in this work, the acoustic emission activity is directly linked to the structural health state of the laminate. At the same time, significant changes on the wave propagation characteristics are reported and correlated to damage accumulation in the composite laminate. In the case of cross ply laminates, experimental tests and numerical simulations indicate that, typical to the presence of transverse cracking and/or delamination, is the increase of the pulse velocity and the transmission efficiency of a propagated ultrasonic wave, an indication that the intact longitudinal plies act as wave guides, as the transverse ply deteriorates. Further to transverse cracking and delamination, the accumulation of longitudinal fibre breaks becomes dominant causing the catastrophic failure of the composite and is expected to be directly linked to the acoustic behaviour of the composite, as the stiffness loss results to the velocity decrease of the propagated wave. In view of the above, the scope of the current work is to assess the efficiency of acoustic emission and ultrasonic transmission as a combined methodology for the assessment of the introduced damage and furthermore as a structural health monitoring tool. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

Samples consistent with cellophane were divided into 5 sterilization groups: non-sterile, autoclave, gamma irradiation, hydrogen peroxide and ethylene oxide. Samples were tested while dry or after saline solution immersion. Tensile properties were compared using ANOVA, unpaired t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests and Fisher&#039;s exact tests. P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nRESULTS: One thin film was consistent with cellophane and it could be differentiated from the other thin films by visible striations. Cellophane was strongest when strips were oriented parallel with its fiber direction and saline immersion reduced its strength by 48% (P &lt; .001). All sterilization methods except autoclave significantly weakened wet cellophane (ethylene oxide [P &lt; .001], gamma irradiation [P &lt; .001], and hydrogen peroxide [P &lt; .001]).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Thin film from most sources was not consistent with cellophane.

The derivation involves no a priori choice of asymptotic expansion or ansatz. It yields a frame-indifferent Cosserat membrane theory with one Cosserat vector field. The theory is applied to multi-well energy functions appropriate to martensitic materials. It is found that, unlike in bulk materials, which generally only support finely twinned austenite/martensite interfaces as energy minimizing states, the thin film theory predicts the existence of exact, untwinned austenite/martensite interfaces. These are used to construct some simple energy minimizing deformations-&quot;tents&quot; and &quot;tunnels&quot;-that could possibly be the basis of simple large-deformation microactuators. Explicit results are given for martensitic materials in the systems NiMnGa, NiTi, NiTiCu, and NiAl. A certain alloy of precise composition Ni30.5Ti49.5Cu20.0 is predicted to support a four-sided &quot;tent&quot; on an (001) film, which furthermore is predicted to collapse to the substrate upon heating. A formal derivation is given of higher order theories, which yields two additional Cosserat vectors and an explicit form of the bending energy.

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one major cause of pneumonia in human and contains various virulence factors that contribute to pathogenesis of pneumococcal disease. This study investigated the role of pneumolysin, Ply, in facilitating S. pneumoniae invasion into the host blood stream.\n\nMETHODS: S. pneumoniae strains were isolated from clinical blood and sputum samples and confirmed by PCR. Expression of ply gene was assessed by infecting human monocytes and pneumocytes.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 23 strains of S. pneumoniae isolated from blood (n = 11) and sputum (n = 12) along with S. pneumoniae ATCC49619 were used to infect human monocyte (THP-1) and Type II pneumocyte (A549) cell lines. All clinical strains of S. pneumoniae showed higher expression of ply mRNA than the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain. Among the clinical strains, blood isolates showed higher expression of ply genes than sputum isolates, i.e., 2(1.5)- to 2(1.6)-folds in THP-1 and 2(0.4)- to 2(4.9)-folds in A549 cell lines.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The data from the current study demonstrated that ply gene of blood- and sputum-derived S. pneumoniae is differentially expressed in two different cell lines. Under survival pressure, ply is highly expressed in these two cell lines for blood-derived S. pneumoniae, indicating that ply gene may facilitate S. pneumoniae invasion into the host blood system.",

It reviews two conceptually different, but related, approaches to achieve reversible, elastic response to large strain deformations in inorganic films that can be used for electronics. It shows that these methods can be scaled to active devices, circuits, and full-integrated systems. Further optimization of the approaches and development of new application possibilities appear to represent promising directions for future work. There are two main approaches to achieve stretchability in electronics. One design uses isolated, rigid islands, which are fabricated with semiconductor components on top and linked by stretchable, interconnects of conducting materials. Another different, but complementary method is to directly produce stretchable electronic devices based on well-defined sinusoidal distributions of surface relief through non-linear buckling processes. © 2010 Copyright Elsevier Inc.

We measured their cross-sectional areas and perimeters from cinefluorographic enlargements during distension. From flattened to circular cross sections, the perimeter of latex tubes remained constant while the area increased exclusively by bending of the walls. Compliance was large in this regime. After circular cross sections were reached, further increases in area were associated with increments in perimeter and there was stretching of the wall. Compliance declined sharply. Veins did not show a distinct two-regime behavior but a combination of bending and stretching which extended the region of large compliance to values of transmural pressure of physiological interest. Using classical theory of elasticity, we propose mathematical relationships describing the proportionality between the pressure and the curvature of the wall during the regime where bending is the primary controlling mechanism. We mechanized these relationships on an analog computer and correlated the solutions with the physical experiments. We conclude that no modulus of elasticity, alone, can relate the pressure and the volume when bending is predominant. In this regime the significant quantity is the modulus of flexural rigidity.",

Finite element analysis suggested that numerical values of strain were not directly continuous across the interface; the values in the film were higher when a soft film was deposited on a hard substrate. The new model was constructed based on this discontinuity; whereby, separate weighting factors were applied to account for the influence of the substrate in strain developed in the film and vice-versa. By comparing the model to experimental data from thirteen different amorphous thin film materials on a silicon substrate, constants in each weighting factor were found to have physical significance in being numerically similar to the bulk scale Poisson&#039;s ratios of the materials involved. When employing these material properties in the new model it was found to provide an improved match to the experimental data over the existing Doerner and Nix and Gao models. Finally, the model was found to be capable of assessing the Young&#039;s modulus of thin films that do not exhibit a flat region as long as the bulk Poisson&#039;s ratio is known.

Yet, almost 150 years since its inception, its foundations and basic postulates are still the subject of debate. Here we suggest that the main postulate of statistical mechanics, the equal a priori probability postulate, should be abandoned as misleading and unnecessary. We argue that it should be replaced by a general canonical principle, whose physical content is fundamentally different from the postulate it replaces: it refers to individual states, rather than to ensemble or time averages. Furthermore, whereas the original postulate is an unprovable assumption, the principle we propose is mathematically proven. The key element in this proof is the quantum entanglement between the system and its environment. Our approach separates the issue of finding the canonical state from finding out how close a system is to it, allowing us to go even beyond the usual boltzmannian situation.",

One of the\nmajor problems when using ply-angles as design variables, is the\nlack of convexity of the objective function and thus the existence\nof local optima, which implies that usual gradient based optimization\nprocedures may not be effective. Therefore, a new general approach\nthat avoids the abovementioned problems of nonconvexity when ply-angles\nare used as design variables is proposed. The methodology is based\nupon the fact that the design space for an optimization problem formulated\nin lamination parameters [introduced by Tsai and Pagano (1968)] is\nproven to be convex, because the laminate stiffnesses are expressed\nlinearly in terms of the lamination parameters. However, lamination\nparameters have at least two major shortcomings: as yet, for the\ngeneral case involving membrane-bending coupling, the constraints\nbetween the lamination parameters are not completely defined; also,\nfor a prescribed set of lamination parameters physically realizable\ncomposite laminates (e.g. laminates with equal thickness plies) may\nnot exist. The approach here, uses both lamination parameters and\nply-angles and thereby uses the advantages of both and eliminates\nthe shortcomings of both.\n\nIn order to illustrate this approach, several stiffness optimization\nexamples are provided.",

However, how the friction plays a role is not well understood. In this paper, a commercially available finite element analysis code, LS-DYNA, is used to model the ballistic impact of a square patch of single-ply plain-woven fabric. Three types of boundary conditions are applied on the fabric: four edges clamped, two edges clamped, and four edges free. The friction between yarns at their crossovers and the friction between projectile and fabric are taken into account. Effects of the friction during the phase prior to yarn failure are parametrically studied. Simulation results show that at a given time, the fabric with high friction absorbs more energy than the fabric with no friction. For the boundary condition with four edges free, friction contributes to increasing the fabric energy absorption mainly through the mechanism of frictional sliding dissipated energy. For the boundary conditions with two or four edges clamped, the energy dissipated through frictional sliding only accounts for a very small portion of the total absorbed energy; however, both the yarn strain energy and the yarn kinetic energy are increased when there is friction. Friction has an indirect effect on the fabric energy absorption by influencing the number of yarns that become involved. Simulation results also indicate that the boundary conditions significantly affect the fabric deformation, stress distribution, and time history of energy absorption. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Its response to infrared radiation is analyzed in this paper. The pixel structure is modeled as a composite laminate thin plate whose sides are measured with the thickness from 0.1-1 μm. Its middle ply is a ferroelectric thin film. Its top surface is covered with a gold or platinum infrared absorber, while the bottom surface is deposited with platinum or lanthanum-nickel. Meanwhile both surfaces are a pair of electrodes. The top surface receives infrared radiation pulses successively. For the very tiny micro bolometer pixel, it is assumed that the infrared radiation is uniformly distributed on the plate. Furthermore, as the ratio of the side length to the thickness of the plate is dramatically large, it is assumed that heat transfer only takes place across the thickness of the plate. The thermal-electric-mechanical coupling governing equations are solved in a form of Fourier series. Results of the displacement, temperature variation and electric output signals of the micro bolometer pixel structure under infrared radiation are obtained, analyzed and compared with experimental data.",

The model is formulated in a continuum damage mechanics framework using internal variables taken as second rank tensors. Use is made of the correspondence principle for linear viscoelastic solids to define a pseudo strain energy function in the Laplace domain. This function is then expressed as a polynomial in transformed strain and tensorial damage variables using the integrity bases restricted by the initial orthotropic symmetry of the material. The constitutive relationships derived in the Laplace domain are then converted to the time domain by using the inverse Laplace transform. The model is applied to the specific case of cross-ply laminates with transverse matrix cracks. The material coefficient functions appearing in the model are determined by a numerical (finite element) method for one cross-ply laminate configuration at one damage level. Predictions of the viscoelastic response are then made for the same laminate at other damage levels and for other cross-ply laminate configurations at different damage levels. These predictions agree well with independently determined time variations of properties by an analytic method (Kumar and Talreja, 2001, Linear viscoelastic behavior of matrix cracked cross-ply laminates. Mechanics of Materials 33 (3), 139–154) as well as with the numerically calculated values.

In particular the slope of da/. dN-vs.-??. K-curves is much steeper and the threshold value higher than in homogeneous metals. In the present paper, the general case of a fatigue crack located in a thin layer of elastic-plastic material embedded in an elastic surrounding is considered analytically. Since the layer is thin compared to the size of the plastic zone, linear-elastic fracture mechanics is not applicable. Therefore Paris&#039; law is formulated in terms of CTOD. It was found that a non-linear shielding mechanism reduces CTOD of a crack in the layer compared to a crack in bulk material under the same stress intensity. The shielding decreases with increasing stress intensity factor. This effect leads to the steep da/. dN curves. Based on the hypothesis of a linear damage accumulation in the active plastic zone, an analytical formula is derived to estimate the fatigue crack growth rate as well as the threshold values of cracks in thin interlayers.

            "abstract": "This study is aimed at comparing the response of TS-based (epoxy) and TP-based (PPS or PEEK) laminates subjected to low velocity impacts. C-scan inspections showed that impact led to diamond-shaped damage resulting from different failure mechanisms: fiber breakages in warp and weft directions, more or less inter-laminar and intra-ply damage, and extensive delamination in C/PEEK and C/epoxy laminates. The permanent indentation can be ascribed to specific mechanisms which mainly depend on many factors including the ultimate out-of-plane shear strength, and the interlaminar fracture toughness in modes I-II-III. In TP-based laminates, the matrix plasticization seems to play an important role in matrix-rich areas by locally promoting permanent deformations. Fiber-bridging also prevents the plies from opening in mode I, and slows down the propagation of interlaminar and intralaminar cracks in modes II-III. Both mechanisms seem to reduce the extension of damages, in particular, the subsequent delamination for a given impact energy. In epoxy-based laminates, the debris of broken fibers and matrix get stuck in the cracks and the adjacent layers, and create a sort of blocking system that prevents the cracks and delamination from closing after impact. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",

Carboxylic acid-terminated SAMs (CATSAMs) are of special interest because their surface properties are highly pH-dependent. To elucidate the complicated pH-dependent structural properties of CATSAMs, we combine force-field molecular dynamics simulations with hybrid quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations of vibrational frequencies. These studies show that at low pH the carboxylic acids behave similarly to bulk carboxylic acids, hydrogen bonding mainly to the aqueous phase. With increasing pH, intralayer hydrogen bonds and monolayer disorder increase. The computed QM/MM vibrational data show that the observed range of carbonyl frequencies is due to inherent condensed phase properties of the CATSAMs such as fluctuating hydrogen bond environment and steric interactions. The results reported herein underscore the role H-bonding and steric congestion play in pH-dependent structural properties of CATSAMs.",

Little research has been done on the fatigue of thin-walled tubular sections below 4 mm thickness. The weld profile and weld undercut may affect the fatigue crack propagation life of welded joints especially for thin-walled sections. Numerical analysis of 2-dimensional non-load carrying thin-walled cruciform joints was performed to determine the effect of weld profile and weld undercut on fatigue crack propagation life under cyclic tensile loading. The cruciform joints analyzed are made up of 3 mm thick plates, joined by fillet welds. The Boundary Element Analysis System Software (BEASY) is used, which uses fracture mechanics theory to carry out crack propagation analysis. The weld profiles and weld undercuts were measured from welded connections in thin-walled fillet welded sections. The measured weld profiles and undercut were used in the analysis. The results are compared with those of a similar study to determine the comparative reduction in fatigue crack propagation life between thin-walled cruciform joints (T = 3 mm) and thicker walled cruciform joints (T = 20 mm). This paper provides an understanding of the impact which weld toe undercut has on the fatigue crack propagation life of thin-walled cruciform joints. The presence of undercuts may reduce the benefits of the thickness effect in thin-walled joints of thicknesses less than 4 mm.",

Strength is predicted by applying a failure criterion based on the tensile stress distribution in the 0-degrees plies, as modified by damage (either quasi-static or fatigue).

The solutions of Schrodinger&#039;s equation are electron standing waves-or &#039;quantum-well&#039; states-characterized by the quantum number n, the number of half-wavelengths that span the well. Quantum-well states can be experimentally realized in a thin film, which confines the motion of the electrons in the direction normal to the film: for layered semiconductor quantum wells, the aforementioned quantization condition provides (with the inclusion of boundary phases) a good description of the quantum-well states. The presence of such states in layered metallic nanostructures is believed to underlie many intriguing phenomena, such as the oscillatory magnetic coupling of two ferromagnetic layers across a non-magnetic layer(1,2) and giant magnetoresistance(3). But our understanding of the properties of the quantum-well states in metallic structures is still limited. Here we report photoemission experiments that reveal the spatial variation of the quantum-well wavefunction within a thin copper film. Our results confirm an earlier proposal(4) that the amplitude of electron waves confined in a metallic thin film is modulated by an envelope function (of longer wavelength), which plays a key role in determining the energetics of the quantum-well states.",

            "abstract": "Lead zirconate titanate (PbZrxTi1-xO3, or PZT) is a piezoelectric material widely used as sensors and actuators. For microactuators, PZT often appears in the form of thin films to maintain proper aspect ratios. One major challenge encountered is accurate measurement of piezoelectric coefficients of PZT thin films. In this paper, we present a simple, low-cost, and effective method to measure piezoelectric coefficient d33 of PZT thin films through use of basic principles in mechanics of vibration. A small impact hammer with a tiny tip acts perpendicularly to the PZT thin-film surface to generate an impulsive force. In the meantime, a load cell at the hammer tip measures the impulsive force and a charge amplifier measures the responding charge of the PZT thin film. Then the piezoelectric coefficient d33 is obtained from the measured force and charge based on piezoelectricity and a finite element modeling. We also conduct a thorough parametric study to understand the sensitivity of this method on various parameters, such as substrate material, boundary conditions, specimen size, specimen thickness, thickness ratio, and PZT thin-film material. Two rounds of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of this new method. The first experiment is to measure d33 of a PZT disk resonator whose d33 is known. Experimental results show that d33 measured via this method is as accurate as that from the manufacturer&#039;s specifications within its tolerance. The second experiment is to measure d33 of PZT thin films deposited on silicon substrates. With the measured d33, we predict the displacement of PZT thin-film membrane microactuators. In the meantime, the actuator displacement is measured via a laser Doppler vibrometer. The predicted and measured displacements agree very well validating the accuracy of this new method.",

Full coupling between the thermal, electrical and mechanical fields is taken into consideration. Pre-buckling state is assumed to be steady, and initial thermal stresses are computed accordingly. The geometrical stiffness matrix is then formed, and the critical temperature and buckling mode are obtained. Numerical examples are presented to verify the proposed method.

The element has the capability to accommodate the drop-off within the element. Therefore, drop-off need not lie along the nodal lines. As a result, drop-off location is independent of the mesh division. This facilitates the use of a coarse mesh at the ply drop location even when the stagger distance is very small. This element can be used in the global model without increasing the size of the global structural matrices. The stiffness matrix is developed by superimposing the stiffness matrices of all layers. Since the size of the dropped layer is different from the size of the element a special integration technique has been adopted for developing the stiffness matrices of dropped layers. In addition, a degenerated 1D drop-off element has been discussed. The 1D element can be used when the lateral dimension of the plate is high in comparison to longitudinal dimension. The validation of the proposed drop-off element has been carried out with the help of numerical examples.",

            "abstract": "Induction of immunity at mucosal surfaces is thought to be an essential feature in the protection of the host against the many pathogens that gain access through these surfaces. Here we describe how strong local and systemic immune responses can be generated when proteins are genetically conjugated to pneumolysin (PLY) from Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and PsaA from S. pneumoniae, we have shown that genetic fusion (eGFPPLY and PsaAPLY) is essential to ensure high levels of antigen specific IgG and IgA in the serum and at mucosal surfaces. This form of vaccination is highly effective with antigen specific antibodies detected after a single dose of nanogram quantities of the conjugated proteins. In addition, generation of a non-toxic variant (eGFP??6PLY) indicated that while the toxic activity of PLY was not essential for adjuvanticity, it contributed to the magnitude of the response generated. Whilst vaccination with the PsaAPLY fusion proteins did not protect the animals from challenge, these studies confirm the utility of pneumolysin to act as a novel mucosal adjuvant to substantially increase the local and systemic humoral response to genetically fused protein antigens. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

            "abstract": "Although there has been renewed interest in the use of fractional models in many application areas, in reality fractional analysis has a long and distinguished history and can be traced back to the likes of Leibniz (Letter to L&#039;Hospital, 1695), Liouville (J. A parts per thousand c. Polytech. 13:71, 1832), and Riemann (Gesammelte Werke, p. 62, 1876). Recent publications (Podlubny in Math. Sci. Eng. 198, 1999; Sabatier et al. in Advances in fractional calculus: theoretical developments and applications in physics and engineering, Springer, Berlin, 2007; Das in Functional fractional calculus for system identification and controls, Springer, Berlin, 2007) demonstrate that fractional derivative models have found widespread applications in science and engineering. Late fundamental considerations have led to the introduction of fractional calculus in continuum mechanics in an attempt to develop non-local constitutive relations (Lazopoulos in Mech. Res. Commun. 33:753-757, 2006). Attempts have also been made to model microscopic forces using fractional derivatives (Vazquez in Nonlinear waves: classical and quantum aspects, pp. 129-133, 2004). Our approach in this paper differs from previous theoretical work, in that we develop a general framework directly from the classical continuum mechanics, by defining the laws of motion and the stresses using fractional derivatives. The timeliness and relevance of this work is justified by the surge in interest in applications of fractional order models to biological, physical and economic systems. The aim of the present paper is to lay the foundations for a new non-local model of continuum mechanics based on fractional order derivatives which we will refer to as the fractional model of continuum mechanics. Following the theoretical development, we apply this framework to two one-dimensional model problems: the deformation of an infinite bar subjected to a self-equilibrated load distribution, and the propagation of longitudinal waves in a thin finite bar.",

            "abstract": "The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize Einstein&#039;s theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes. The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems, as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium fluctuations through fluctuation relations. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For a wide class of patterns of delamination, it is shown that the loading on the delamination front progressively goes from mode I to mode II during growth of the blister. As a result, the mode dependence of the film/substrate interface excludes widespread delamination. This explains the observations of blisters of finite extent, which are otherwise difficult to interpret. We also study a model of interfacial fracture with friction. It reveals that a severe mode dependence can be induced by interfacial friction. This permits us to account for the mode dependence using only simple ingredients: friction and linear elasticity.",

We begin with a discussion of surface curvature and focus on the role of special surfaces of curvature to show how such surfaces can be defined to eliminate either the coupling of the compressibility and bending terms (neutral surface) or the saddle-splay (Gaussian curvature) modulus. Next, we consider phenomenological models for curvature elasticity and discuss the coupling of the curvature degrees of freedom with other properties of the system such as the packing area and the number of molecules at the interface. The pressure distribution in the film is related to the bending moduli. We then connect the elastic moduli to the physical properties of both solid and liquid thin films with a detailed discussion of the role of solid elasticity (including defects), electrostatic interactions (applicable to polar head groups and chain packing (using a block copolymer model of amphiphilic molecules). Finally, we demonstrate the effects of fluctuations and inhomogeneities in these systems in a discussion of the role of thermal undulations in renormalizing the bending moduli and of mixtures of amphiphiles of different chain lengths in fluid films.

            "abstract": "This paper introduces a simple method for engineering analysis of ply drop-off induced local bending effects in CFRP/honeycomb sandwich panels. The model constituent parts are the base-line face laminate of a CFRP/sandwich panel, a dropped sub-laminate, a supporting honeycomb core material, and an adhesive/resin layer interfacing the laminates. The interaction between the core material and the face laminates is modelled using a two-parameter elastic foundation model. Two examples are evaluated, and it is shown that the elastic response is strongly influenced by the presence of a supporting core material. The results of a brief parametric study are presented, and it is demonstrated that the ply drop-off problem is influenced significantly by the out-of-plane stiffness of the honeycomb core, by the bending stiffness of the base-line face laminate and finally by the bending stiffness of the dropped sub-laminate. The paper is concluded by a discussion of design aspects. © 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.",

            "abstract": "I suggest that the common unease with taking quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of nature (the &quot;measurement problem&quot;) could derive from the use of an incorrect notion, as the unease with the Lorentz transformations before Einstein derived from the notion of observer-independent time. I suggest that this incorrect notion is the notion of observer-independent state of a system (or observer-independent values of physical quantities). I reformulate the problem of the &quot;interpretation of quantum mechanics&quot; as the problem of deriving the formalism from a few simple physical postulates. I consider a reformulation of quantum mechanics in terms of information theory. All systems are assumed to be equivalent, there is no observer-observed distinction, and the theory describes only the information that systems have about each other; nevertheless, the theory is complete.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we perform a quantification of the uncertainty propagation of the dynamics of slender initially curved structures constructed with fiber reinforced composite materials. Depending on the manufacturing process, composite materials may have deviations with respect to the expected response, often called nominal response in a deterministic sense. The manufacturing aspects lead to uncertainty in the structural response associated with constituent proportions, material and/or geometric parameters among others. Another aspect of uncertainty that can be sensitive in composite structures is the mathematical model that represents the mechanics of the structural member, that is: the assumptions and type of hypotheses invoked reflect the most relevant aspects of the physics of a structure, however in some circumstances these hypotheses are not enough, and cannot represent properly the mechanics of the structure. Uncertainties should be considered in a structural system in order to improve the predictability of a given modeling scheme. There are two approaches to evaluate the propagation of uncertainties in structural models: the parametric probabilistic approach and the non-parametric probabilistic approach. In the parametric, one quantifies the uncertainty of given parameters (such as variation of the angles of fiber reinforcement and material constituents) by associating random variables to them. In the non-parametric, the propagation of uncertainty is quantified by considering uncertain the matrices of the whole system. In this study a shear deformable model of composite curved thin-walled beams is employed as the mean or expected model. The probabilistic model is constructed by adopting random variables for the uncertain entities (parameters or matrices) of the model. The probability density functions of the random entities are derived appealing to the maximum entropy principle under given constraints. Once the probabilistic model is discretized in the context of the finite element method, the Monte Carlo method is employed to perform the simulations. Then the statistics of the simulations is evaluated and the parametric and non-parametric approaches are compared.",
